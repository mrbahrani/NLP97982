1 Hold on
I gotta come up
We can't be late
We won't
Who's holding
We were kind of hoping you were
Yeah
How are you not holding
Jesus Christ, Shanna
It is not my fucking job to supply y'all with weed when we go out
You're getting angry kind of quick, don't you think
I was just teasing you
I'm not angry
It just would be nice if y'all didn't just count on me all the fucking time,  and surprise me every once in a while with pot
Okay, mean girl in a high school movie
I'm not having a tantrum
Yes, you are
You've been in the car all of two seconds, and you're already cursing at me
I am not cursing at you
You said, "Jesus Christ, Shanna.
Come on, guys
Don't fight
I'll pay for it when we get some
One: It is not about the money
And two: We're not really fighting
Arlene, have you forgotten what hanging out with Jungle Julia's like
That wasn't a fight
That was Julia acting like a grumpy bitch,  and me calling her on it and indulging her at the same time
That's how we tolerate each other after all these years
Oh, billboard
Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's
Did you call Rafael and tell him we're coming
Of course
You're so good
I know
You bet your ass he is
Christian Simonson, the filmmaker, is in town
He's got a big thing for Julia
If he had a big thing for me, he'd fucking call me  as opposed to disappearing for six months,  and he'd get his ass down here more often than he does,  and on my birthday, give me a fucking phone call
Oh, billboard
Yeah, but you get those legs of yours around him, and it's all over
So, margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's, touch base with Chris and Jesse,  tell them about later, and make damn sure they come
Those other guys will be waiting for us to join them at the Texas Chili Parlor
Oh, shit
Speaking of which, what happened with you and Nate last night
Well, you know, not mu... We just fucking met each other
I mean, if you don't bust their balls a little bit, they're never gonna respect you
How about enlightening us on what it is you did do
Nothing to write home about
We just made out on the couch for about 20 minutes
Dressed, halfdressed or naked
I said we made out
We didn't do the thing
Excuse me for living, but what is "the thing"
You know, it's everything but
I call it "the thing.
Do guys like the thing
Okay, I wanna get back to what it is you did do
So, you're making out on the couch with Nate, right
Correct
His or the one in your hotel room
What am I, stupid over here
Mine
Were you making out sitting up or lying down
We started sitting up
We worked our way to lying down
Who was on top
I was straddling him
What else
That was it
So we made out for a little while on the couch,  and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now, so it's time for you to leave.
And I said, "Yep, right now
Let's go.
what about this?
And I said, "No.
He said, "What do you mean, no
I said, "I already know what you're gonna say,  and the answer's no.
He said, "How can you say you know what I'm gonna say?
I said, "Because you're gonna say, 'let's just go to sleep together
"'We don't gotta do nothing
"'Just cuddle, sleep next to each other, wake up in the morning together.
No, you're gonna leave, but I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, fuck Nate
I mean, he's cute and all,  but Jesse Letterman's gonna be all over her
Remember, no hooking up tonight
You can hang out with him, you can make out with him,  but no hooking up with him, because we are driving to Lake LBJ tonight,  and my daddy's pretty clear about one thing
Your dad talks like that
Hell, yeah
It's not like he ain't gonna know, either,  because when I'm staying at the lake house with my girlfriends in our bikinis,  Daddy just has a tendency to pop up and make sure we don't need anything
Look, he's totally harmless and cute as a bug's ear
But, you know, when he's got a bunch of halfnaked poontang  walking the floor of his lake house,  he just likes to pay us a visit and make sure we got everything we need
And if you flirt shamelessly with him, like the sixfoot baby giraffe in the backseat,  you got a puppy dog for life
You call her dad Ben
I'm not a child
That's his name
They're gonna meet us at the Chili Parlor
Fuck that
No
I don't wanna be either A, depending on their fucking ass,  or B, depending on their ass
Uhuh
We don't score ourselves,  we're gonna be stuck with them all fucking night
Ooh, try Lanna Frank
Best idea you had all day
Oh, hey, that's your last billboard before Guero's
Give me a break
We said every time
Okay
Jules, let me get a drag
Thanks
Hey, this is... and I's U.T
days, Arlene
Hey
Hey
For a second, but I'm with some friends
Oh
So you must be... must be..
Shh
She don't know nothing about it
Know about what
When were y'all gonna tell her
Soon
Tell me what
All right, cut the shit
What the fuck is going on
I said a little somethin'somethin' about you on the air today
All I said was I had a sexy friend named Butterfly  who was in from out of town for the weekend,  and we would be going out somewhere in Austin tonight,  and if they were out on the town, maybe they'd see us
And I described you, and I said that if they spotted you while we were out,  if they'd do something, you'd do something
Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious
What did you say, and what did you say I'd do
Anyhoo, I could explain what I said, which would be boring,  or Marcy over here,  who is an incredible actress, could act it out for you,  which, I think, will give you a better idea  of what you have in store for you tonight
Okay, so just tell me your way
So we'll act it out with Marcy
Okay, give Marcy your drink
Thank you
Okay, so, you're in a club or a bar,  and Marcy's a kind of cute or kind of hot or kind of sexy  or better be fucking hysterically funny, but not funnylooking guy  who you could fuck
Got it
Hi there
Excuse me, but your name wouldn't be Butterfly, would it
Yes, it is
It seems you have me at a disadvantage
Barry
Pleased to meet you, Barry
Y'all are getting me hot
So, is, uh, Butterfly your real name
Yes, it is
And how'd you know my name, Barry
I listened to Jungle Julia's show this morning
Oh, yeah
I listen to her show every morning
Oh, you do, do you
She's, like, the coolest lady in town
Don't you think she's got a big ass
I like her ass that way
She got a black girl's ass
Well, that's what she always says, but, natural fact,  she doesn't really have a black girl's ass
She's got a big ass
Okay, what the fuck are you doing
Oh, look who wants to get to the point all of a sudden
Okay, we'll get to the point
I don't wear their teeth marks on my butt for nothing
No
Okay, okay, okay, okay
So, Butterfly, can I buy you a drink
I'd love one
I'll take a margarita
Here you go
So, after they buy you a drink,  when they raise their glass to toast,  they look you dead in the eye  and repeat this poem:  "The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  "and I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep
"Did you hear me, Butterfly
Miles to go before you sleep.
What
If they call you Butterfly, buy you a drink,  repeat that poem, you gotta give them a lap dance
That's bullshit
I ain't giving them nothing
Well, you can do it or not, but if you don't,  everybody in Austin's gonna think you're a chickenshit
And I don't think you want everybody in Austin thinking you're a chickenshit
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance 'cause of what you said
Yeah, everything's funny to you two when it's happening to me
Look, you don't have to do it for anybody you don't want
I said you'd do it for the first guy who says it
So, some geek comes over, trying to be cool,  just tell him you already did it at another place earlier
No harm, no foul, but you get a free drink out of it
But maybe a little later in the evening,  you've had a few drinks, you're kind of looseygoosey,  you're safe with your girls,  then some kind of cute, kind of hot, kind of sexy, hysterically funny,  but not funnylooking guy comes up and says it,  then maybe you did it earlier, maybe you didn't
You made me trip
You made me trip, you dumb bitch
♪ Baby ♪  ♪ It doesn't matter ♪  ♪ What they say ♪  ♪ I know I'm gonna love you any old way ♪  ♪ What can I do ♪  ♪ Without you

Thank you
Where the hell is Lanna Frank
Lanna Frank
Where are you
Well, come over already
We're waiting for you
Shit
Hold on
Come over already
We're waiting for you
No, we're not coming over there
You come over here like you said you would
So, is it "Shawna" and the girls at the lake house this weekend
"Shawna"
I...  No
Now, there is one thing that every girl in the whole world  whose name is Shanna has in common with each other,  we all hate the name Shawna,  and we really hate it when people call us Shawna
Okay, but at some point in the evening, I had fuckability stock
Yeah
I mean...  it wasn't bullish, but..
Okay, Warren's sending over shots
And you know the house rule:  If he sends over shots, you've gotta do them
Hey, them's the rules, baby
Warren says it, we do it
So let's do it
What is it
Hey, shot first, questions later
Here we go
Post time
Mmm
Ow
What the fuck is it
Chartreuse, the only liquor so good, they named a color after it
Who's down for dos Chartreuse
Not me
I'm going out for a smoke
Okay
But careful where you keep that hot flame, all right
Drinks
What can I get you
Shanna Banana
Bombay Sapphire and tonic, no ice
Good boy
Oh
Flip it
Oh, Jesus Christ
Whoa
You scared the fuck out of me, you shitty asshole
I just got lucky
Oh, hardyfuckinghar
Go inside
Why
I was thinking we could make out
What, on a porch
Not even in the bar, but in front of the entrance
Forget it
No, in my car
What, out there
Not in my car it's not
Look, you won't get wet
I promise you
Hahaha
You know what I mean
Look, I know you guys are going to Lake LBJ, and we can't come
Okay, just stop with the whining
It's not attractive
Okay, but I don't want it superfucking obvious  to everybody in the bar I've been gone,  so we'll go in your car, we'll make out for six minutes and that's it
Deal
Great
Deal or no deal
If you're gonna whine when I pull the plug in six minutes,  we can just walk back inside the fucking bar right now
Deal
No whining
And no begging
When you say done, it's done
Okay, let's go
Oh, you got two jobs:  kiss good and make sure my hair don't get wet
♪ It was early, early one morning ♪  ♪ When I heard my bulldog bark ♪  ♪ 'Twas Staggolee and Billy DeLyon ♪  ♪ Squabbling in the dark ♪  Now look, you can't look like you're trying to get her out of here  before Christian Simonson shows up,  but you've got to get her out of here before Christian Simonson shows up
But what's the point
They're going to Shanna's daddy's house at Lake LBJ,  and it's no guys... absolutely no guys
Okay, so after we bring the girls drinks,  in fairly rapid order, but not obvious, we order two more rounds of shots
You think they're gonna fall for that
Now it's time to turn up the volume
No more fucking around
We go to Jäger shots
Man, they're not gonna drink Jäger shots
Dude, as long as a guy's buying the booze, a fucking bitch'll drink anything
After that, we'll see if they got another Jäger shot in them
You never know
That could be the shot that puts them past the point of "fuck it.
My point exactly
I know I can at least get Shanna "Suck My" Banana  to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot
What's Julia's sweet shot
Key lime pie
Oh, come on
Dude, check it out

Could I get a chicken suit for Stroker Ace, please
I had to get something out of the car, and Nate was gentlemanly enough  to escort me with his umbrella
Ah, good for you, Nate
You see that pretty girl sitting by herself at the bar
Who, the dirty hippie
Meow
She might as well be a hippie
Thank you, Timmy boy
Well, do you know what just happened to her
No
But I know she's a skinny, fakeblonde bitch
Oh, I'm sorry
What about her
Hey, Warren, is there anybody in this place you could vouch for to give me a ride home
Fair lady, your chariot awaits
You've been eavesdropping
I think I belong in the latter category
So, uh, Icy Hot,  are you offering me a ride home
And when are you thinking about leaving
Truthfully, I'm not thinking about it
But when I do, you will be the first to know
I know looks can be deceiving,  but I'm a teetotaler
I've been drinking club soda and lime all night,  and now I'm building up to my big drink
Which is what
Okay
Why would someone who doesn't drink  spend hours at a bar drinking water
A bar offers all kind of things other than alcohol
Mmm
Really
Like what
Women, nacho grande platters,  the fellowship of some fascinating individuals,  like Warren here
Ooh
Is that cowboy wisdom
I'm not a cowboy, Pam
But that's a very easy mistake to make
How do you know my name
When you were talking with Warren,  couldn't help but overhear
So what's your name, Icy
Stuntman Mike
Stuntman Mike's your name
You ask anybody
Hey, Warren, who is this guy
Stuntman Mike
And who the hell is Stuntman Mike
Warren, six shots of Wild Turkey
♪ Oh, I can't stand it again ♪  Yeah
Let's do 'em
Salud
Down the snatch
You know, Pam, I think it's time for my big drink
Well, Stuntman Mike,  since I have a tab here, can I buy you that virgin piña colada
Thank you, Pam
Warren, a, uh, virgin piña colada for my stuntman friend,  and I'll have another Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita

Lanna Frank
Hey, baby
How are you
Hey
What's shaking, bacon
Hey
Well, beggars can't be choosers
Take a picture
It lasts longer
What
That table
Seems to keep, um, getting your attention
Is that the girl from the billboard outside
She sure is a strikinglooking woman
Lots of leavein conditioner
Is that jealousy I detect
Hardly
But if you wanna get with, uh, Jungle Julia, there's a real easy way to do that
Yeah
What would that be
Get famous
You won't have to find her
And you don't even wanna know what she did for that billboard
Enjoy it, cocksucker
You've earned it
What did she ever do to you
We went to school together from kindergarten through high school
She was her height right now at 12
She was a monster
Half the guys she still fucks from the old class,  she used to beat up and terrorize in the fifth grade
I see
And she used to beat you up and take your chocolate milk, huh
That pituitary case
Sorry
I'm built like a girl, not a black man
But I'd die before I ever gave Julia Lucai my chocolate milk
Hey, are you famous or something
No, no, no
Really
Hey, what do you do
What I do is work my ass off to get my own record label off the ground
But why that girl wanted a picture of me  is because I'm a local deejay
Wait a minute
You got a billboard by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you
I got one there, too, Zatoichi
Yeah
Jungle Julia Lucai
Stuntman Mike McKay
Now, my friends and I are gonna continue to get our weed on
Would you care for some
But just the same, no, thanks
Suit yourself
But, you know...  Aw, shit
Oh, God
Sorry
It's nothing
Actually, I do want you to have a shot
You got some voucher here
No fucking clue
Well, technically, I really don't know if he's ever done anything for sure
I mean, he shows me an episode of High Chaparall,  a guy falls off a horse, he says it's him
Yeah, well, there was another actor on that show... Gary Clarke...  and I looked like him a bit
Obviously, before I cut myself shaving
Oh, I like it
Well, damn if you ain't so sweet, you make sugar taste just like salt
And, uh, then that show turned into The Men of Shiloh,  they brought on Lee Majors, and I doubled him
From that point on, I specialized mostly in car stunts
Yeah, I did damn near the whole third season of Vegas
I was Robert Urich's driving double
And then Bob did another show... Gavilan,  and he brought me with him on that till...  And after that...  Do you know any of these shows or people I'm talking about
Sorry
No
So, how exactly does one become a stuntman,  Stuntman Mike
Well, in Hollywood,  anybody fool enough to throw himself down a flight of stairs  can usually find somebody to pay him for it
But, really, I got into the business  the way most people get in the stunt business
My brother got me in it
Well, who's your brother
Stuntman Bob
I'm trying to get these two shows happening in New York for November
Finally
Yeah
You need to catch up with us
Yep
Anyhoo, I'm sorry
Will you forgive me
But you have to be real nice to me for the whole rest of the time I'm here
You ready to go to the lake
Mmhmm
How about your little friend
You wanna bring him
I thought no boys
If you really want him to come, Shanna won't mind
So, how about it
Good idea
Ladies
Thanks
Cheers, Butterfly
"The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  "and I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep
"Did you hear me, Butterfly
Miles to go before you sleep.
Sorry, Stuntman Burt...  Mike
She already broke off that dance
Is that true
Do I frighten you
Is it my scar
It's your car
Ah
Sorry
It's my mom's car
Have you been following us
No
It's just so damn small
You've seen this guy before
I saw him outside of Guero's
And I saw you outside Guero's, too
You saw my car, I saw your legs
So you really weren't following us
I'm not following you, Butterfly
So, how about that lap dance
Sorry
It was a onetimeonly offer,  and she did it earlier this evening at Anton's
No, she didn't
How do you know
I'm good that way
What's "touchéd"
Wounded slightly
Why should I be wounded
Because you expected guys to be pestering you all night,  but from your look, I can tell nobody pestered you at all
There are few things as fetching as a bruised ego  on a beautiful angel
I think I'm gonna have to give you a rain check
Well, since you'll be leaving in the next couple of days,  that rain check will be worthless
But that's okay
I understand if I make you uncomfortable
But I must warn you of something
You know how people say...  "You're okay in my book,"  or, "In my book, that's no good"
Well, I actually have a book
And everybody I ever meet  goes in this book
And now I've met you, and you're going in the book
Except I'm afraid I must file you...  under "chickenshit.
And what if I did it
Well, I definitely couldn't file you under "chickenshit" then, now, could I
Stuntman Mike
Well, Stuntman Mike, I'm Butterfly
Yeah, it is
Yeah
Why don't you go get ready for your lap dance
What about "kind of cute, kind of hot, kind of sexy, hysterically funny,  but not funnylooking guy who you could fuck"  did you not understand

I can still hear you
Bye
Byebye
Wow, that's fucking scary
Scary tends to impress
Is it safe
Oh, it's better than safe
It's death proof
How do you make a car death proof
Well, that's what stuntmen do
Yeah
Well, how do you think they accomplish that
CGI
But back in the allornothing days, the Vanishing Point days,  the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days,  the White Line Fever days...  real cars smashing into real cars  with real dumb people driving them
So, you give the stunt team the car you want to smash up,  take her and reinforce that fucker everywhere,  and voilà, you got yourself a deathproof automobile
That makes sense
Hell, I can drive this baby into a brick wall  doing 125 miles an hour just for the experience
Why is your passenger seat in a box
Well, this is a movie car
Sometimes when you're shooting a crash, director wants to put a camera in the car
You know, shoot the crash from the inside
They call it a crash box
Here
There you go
You know, when you asked to drive me home,  you didn't mention your car didn't have a passenger seat
You asked me for a ride, and I said yes
But look at the bright side, Pam
I won't be getting fresh putting my hand on your knee
That is the bright side
Well, Pam, which way you going
Left or right
Right
Ah, that's too bad
Why
You see, we're both going left
You could've just as easily been going left, too,  and if that was the case,  it would've been a while before you started getting scared
But since you're going the other way,  I'm afraid...  you're gonna have to start getting scared... immediately
Cocksucking motherfucker
Just fucking let me out of here
Okay, here's the thing
I get it
I..
Um, but if you just stop right now,  you know, and... and... and let me out,  I'll never tell anybody, because I know it's a joke
I know all about jokes
I promise everything will be fine
Just... Just... Just let me out,  please, and... and...  Hey, Pam,  remember when I said this car was death proof
Well, that wasn't a lie
This car is 100% death proof
Only, to get the benefit of it, honey,  you really need to be sitting in my seat
Now I gotta catch me my other girlfriends
It's Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Tich
So you got it
Thanks, honey

Come on now, sis
You just tell us
How bad is he
He got banged up real good
Busted nose, broken collarbone,  smashed up his left index finger
He was real lucky
That'll be all
Why, that's more than enough, and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block
Son of a bitch
Well, son number one,  what I think is so goddamn ghoulish,  I hesitate to speak it out loud
Well, give it a shot
That old boy in there murdered them pretty little gals
I mean, he used a car and not a hatchet, but they dead just the same
Well, what are you gonna do
Not a goddamn thing
The DA says ain't no crime here
And old Hooper in there  came out clean as a whistle
Now, you actually think that he premeditatedly murdered them gals
Well, I can't prove it,  but since thinking don't cost nothing, I can think it, and I do
Yeah, but, Pop, he got pretty banged up hisself
Well, hell, yeah, he got banged up, but God damn
Any of 'em survive
Two tons of metal, 200 miles an hour,  flesh and bone and plain old Newton..
They all princess died
Why
Well, I'd guestimate it's a sex thing
The only way I can figure it
Highvelocity impact,  twisted metal, busted glass,  all four souls taken exactly at the same time
Probably the only way that diabolical degenerate can shoot his goo
Yeah, I think the only thing we can dream of getting that bastard on  is vehicular manslaughter for the hitchhiker in the death box
Now, on paper, it's gonna look like he's just trying to help her out
I mean, that's the way the jury's gonna see it
So what are you gonna do, Pop
Well, I can take it upon myself to work the case, you know,  in my off hours
Alert authorities
Dog that rotten son of a bitch
Wherever he goes, I go
Or I can spend  the same goddamn amount of time and energy  following the NASCAR circuit
Hmm
I think I'd have a hell of lot happier life if I did the latter
And just because I can't punish old... Frankenstein in there for what he's done,  I'm gonna tell you like the Lord told John
If he ever does it again,  I can make goddamn sure he don't do it in Texas

Who's in whose room
He's in mine
And, so, what happened then
That was pretty much it
We made out in the hall for about 10 minutes, and then I sent him off to his room
So, how's The Rock as a kisser
He's got them mushy lips and fingertips
Mmm, I love them mushy lips
And he's a big guy,  so he spins me around so my back's up against him
Damn, that sounds sexy
Mmm, it was sexy
But then that was it
You sent him off
Wait a minute
What are we doing here
If I'm gonna power through and pick up Zoë at the airport,  I need a bigass cup of coffee
Since you're getting that,  can you get some more vodka and some more sugarfree Red Bull
We didn't know you were awake
But get some more vodka and some more sugarfree Red Bull anyway
And some Red Apple Tans
Damn
I didn't stop to get you bitches groceries
You remember how to get to the airport, don't you
Uhhuh
Well, then, you should get behind the wheel,  'cause you gonna drive
They ain't got sugarfree Red Bull
They got regular Red Bull and sugarfree G.O
juice
G.O

Yello
It's me
Miss me
I've seen Kim sit on it before
Her ass ain't your ass
So, I think I'm in this month's issue of Allure
You got Allure
Magazines by the window
Here you are
You hot mama, you
3.85
Out of 20
Thank you very much
You know, I got other fashion magazines for sale behind the counter
No, that's okay
This'll be all
Thanks anyway
Have a good one
I got this month's issue of Italian Vogue
Listen to this
The Circle A clerk has this month's issue of Italian Vogue
No way
Way
I can't believe a fucking Circle A carries Italian Vogue
It doesn't
It's his own personal copy
Twentyseven bucks
We're talking about fucking per diem here
Look, we found an issue of Italian Vogue in Lebanon, Tennessee
We're lucky he's not asking for fucking Krugerrands
I'm getting it, and we're splitting it three ways
What, me, you and Kim
No, Kim doesn't give a shit about Italian Vogue
But Brandy will come in with us, and if she won't, Tysla, her sister, will
But if anybody tears out any sheets I want,  you gotta make color Xerox of those pages
And I'm not talking fucking Kinko's here either, okay
You take it to the art department, you have them do it fucking right

Your timing couldn't be better, Zoë
It just so happens that we're all three off duty for the next three days of shooting
Well, I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup, and she's off for the next three days,  there's no stunts being filmed during that time, so Kim's free,  and Lee's on a "will notify" for the next four days
So, how's the shoot going
Great
We're having the best time
We're making the coolest movie and partying all the time
Hell, yeah
The next job after this one is definitely gonna suck
So, let's hear it, ladies
Set romances
Who's getting it off
That would be Lee and Toolbox
Oh, Toolbox
He's a grip
What he is is a pervert
Well, he just keeps sounding better and better
What's his perversion
Lee is sitting on the toilet, and Toolbox is watching her pee
PISSING
Yeah, but not no more
Now she's getting it on with The Rock
Not the real Rock
He's this electrician named Bruce
And Kim started calling him The Rock, 'cause he kind of looks like The Rock,  so now we all just call him The Rock
This is an allstar crew
We got a guy who looks like Nick Cage  and a guy who looks like Peewee Herman, too
Kim, dick department
Let's hear it
Mmmm
I got a man
About three months
Who'd you steal him from
Nobody
Wha... What
He totally had a girlfriend
All of Kim's boyfriends start out as somebody else's boyfriend
I did not steal him
I didn't steal any of them
They just... jumped ship
So, what's your story, Abernathy
I had a set crush on Cecil
Set crush
You were his set wife
"Were" and "had" being the key words here
Bitch, you two are still into each other, and you know it
Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me,  then whey did he fuck Daryl Hannah's standin
Hohoho
Oh, it's so funny
Oh, it's so funny
Oh, stop acting all hurt
Your ass just mad
Bitch, you need to get over that shit
That was two weeks ago
Oh, well, now that you put it like that
Oh, I haven't told you the best part
He fucked her on my birthday
Oh, that's a horse of a different color
He's the director
He's kind of busy
He ate a piece of my birthday cake and he got me a present
Yeah, I think he knew
Well, what did he get you
He made me a tape
Yeah
Wait
He didn't burn you a CD
He made you a tape
Yeah
Oh, that is so romantic
I know what you're gonna say, so don't even go there
Look, I know you guys like him
He's likable, but he fucked another woman on my birthday
How can you not be on my side
Well, I admit, that sounds bad
It is bad
Were you two fucking
Hell, no
Hello
Is your name Abernathy
Sorry
The answer to your question is no, of course not
And if you fuck Cecil, you don't become one of his girlfriends
Not to say I want to be his girlfriend,  but if I did want to be his girlfriend,  if I fucked him, I wouldn't be his girlfriend
I'd be one of his regulars
And I'm just getting too fucking old for that shit
Yes
I've let him give me a foot massage,  and when we go to the movies, I've let him hold my hand
Bitch, you might be acting like you 12 years old,  but he just acting like a man
You need to break that nigga off a piece
Let me get this straight
You're not sucking him...  Mmmm
You're not giving him any tongue, but Daryl Hannah's standin is
Okay, can we just take my sex life off the table
Ohhh
Fuck both of you and your little high five
Before you can claim a nigga, you got to claim a nigga,  and you can start by giving that motherfucker a hand job  in the back of the van on Tuesday
I'm not gonna do that
I know you won't
But you know who will
The bitch that ends up living in that bigass mansion of his
Now, I gotta say, I haven't entirely agreed with everything Kim said, but it is true:  If you stretch shit out like you have with Cecil,  and you suddenly get dirty on them,  it blows their mind
Three Kicks to the Head, Part Three
And, admittedly, we're a little fuckedup
Cheers to that
Word
Cheers
So, Zoë,  the genius,  wants to take a picture of me
So she's got her camera and keeps saying,  "Step back a little," so I do
Then, "A little further," so I step back a little further
Then, "A little more," so I do
Then I realize I'm right at the edge  of a sevenfoot concrete ditch  with God knows how many rocks and broken bottles and rats in it,  and if I fell in that fucking thing, I'd probably would've broken my fucking neck
So I'm yelling at her, "Zoë, you almost killed me!
So we laugh about it and walk a little further,  and Zoë starts fucking around,  and damn if she doesn't fall in the fucking ditch
Nice
Thank you
Thank you
I remember taking a step and looking down
What happened
What, with Zoë the cat
Nothing
If I fell in that fucking thing,  they would've had to helicopter me out of there
Zoë just lands on her feet
But then, later, I started feeling a little bad about myself
Zoë falls in the ditch, and it's nothing
We're laughing about it
Oh, honey, you can't think like that
You know, we all have our individual talents,  and that just happens to be one of Zoë's
Well...  physically speaking, Zoë is amazing
I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness
There's few human beings that can fuck with Zoë on that front
Oh, Kim, I like you, too
You didn't fall in the ditch, Zoë did
Zoë even knew there was a ditch there because you told her,  and she still fell in
So, Lee's right
We all have our talents
Hey, I resemble that remark
Check it out, bitch
Ooh, nice one, mate
What's a roscoe
A roscoe is a pistol
You carry a gun
Uhhuh
You have a license to carry it
When I became a Secret Service agent, they gave me a license
Oh, I didn't know you were..
Okay, I didn't say it, all right
Stop looking at me
God
Did you know Kim carried a gun
Yes
Now, do I approve
No
Yes
Look, I don't know what futuristic utopia you live in,  but the world I live in, a bitch need a gun
You can't get around the fact that people who carry guns  tend to get shot more than people who don't
And you can't get around the fact that if I go down  to the laundry room in my building at midnight enough times,  I might get my ass raped
Fuck that
There are other things you can carry other than a gun
Pepper spray
Uh, motherfucker try to rape me, I don't wanna give him a skin rash
I wanna shut that nigga down
How about a knife at least
You know what happens to motherfuckers carry knives
They get shot
Look, if I ever become a famous actress,  I won't carry a gun
I'll hire me a dodirt nigga, and he'll carry the gun
And when shit goes down, I'll sit back and laugh
So, Zoë, you thought about what you want to do first
It just so happens I know exactly what I wanna do
Oh, really
And what would that be
To me, there's no point in being in America  unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car
And I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger
Um, well, I guess we can talk to Transpo
But does it have to be a Dodge Challenger
It has to be a 1970 Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine
How in the fuck do you expect to do that
No worries, mate
I've got it all worked out
When I knew I was coming here, I went online and found out  that the local paper here in Tennessee is the Lebanon News Sentinel
I'm sorry
Where's home
Australia, right
What do you mean by that, mate
I repeat, never... call a Kiwi an Aussie
That is, unless you want your ass kicked
I'm so sorry
Oh, it's okay
We're just taking the piss out of you, mate
Auckland, to answer your question
Anyway, I subscribed to the local paper a month ago
Now, why the fuck you want a local redneck newspaper in New Zealand
I've been getting the paper for the last month,  and I've been checking the classified at the back, looking at cars for sale
And you wanna buy it
Kim, I may be stupid, but I'm not bloody stupid
I wanna say I wanna buy it, so he'll let me testdrive it
A 1970 Dodge Challenger with a white paint job
Kowalski from Vanishing Point
Mate, it's a fucking classic
Mmm, I get it
If I can get this guy to let me drive it without him,  I will blow the doors off that bitch
What's Vanishing Point
"What's Vanishing Point?
Abs, I'm supposed to be the illiterate one
It's just one of the best American movies ever made
Actually, Zoë, most girls wouldn't know Vanishing Point
Excuse me
What the fuck are you two
Yeah, well, we're gearheads
Of course we watched it
Y'all grew up watching that Pretty in Pink shit
Oh, I like Pretty in Pink
What, so you didn't watch John Hughes movies
I'm a girl
But I also watched car shit, too
Vanishing Point, Dirty Mary Crazy Larry...  Mmhmm
Gone in 60 Seconds..
We have an outdoors theater in Auckland
It plays Vanishing Point, Big Wednesday,  all the classics
What do you horny gals want
Hey, you got a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale
Right up here, ladies
This shit is off the fucking hook
Sweet ass
Well, if you'll excuse me for a moment,  I'd just like to have a word alone with my business associate
Okay
Mmm
What are you waiting for
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself
I..
I intend to, but first, I need to ask you something
What
If he lets us take it out on our own, I wanna play ship's mast
Would you keep it down
Ain't no way I'm doing ship's mast
For Christ sakes...   Don't blaspheme
Sorry
Look, I know what I said...  What did you say
I know I said we shouldn't do this again...  No
You didn't say we shouldn't
You said we ain't ever gonna do that again
Now, did you or did you not say that
Well...  No, no, no, no
Answer the question, motherfucker
Did you or did you not say that
Yes, I said that
However...  Whatever with your "however.
Look, I know I said it, and I know I meant it..
Yeah, but when I said it, I didn't mean in America
Oh, nigga, please
Really..
I meant we should never play ship's mast again  in New Zealand or Australia
Look, I know what I said when I said it
But when I said it, I didn't know I'd ever come to America
Right
Okay, oddly enough, I actually understood that
However, just because you talked yourself into some stupid shit  doesn't mean I have lost my goddamn mind
You need two people to play ship's mast, and I ain't playing
I don't need me no best friend lives on the other side of planet Earth
I'll crack your back
You'll crack it anyway
Well, of course I'll crack it anyway
But now, while I'm here, I'll be your backcracking slave
Whenever you want it, you got it
You don't even have to ask for it
Just be, like...  "Bitch, get over here and get busy.
You crack my back, you'll give me foot massages...  Mmhmm
Mmm
Deal
So, we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him
If he does, you wait here with Lee, and we'll be back in a moment
I said, we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him..
I heard what you said
I just can't believe what you said
You know, you two got some fucking balls
What
Don't play dumbass with me
I'm still a little drunk and I have a hangover
But because Zoë wanted to drive some fucking Vanishing Point car, I'm here
Now you two got the balls to ask me... no, scratch that...  tell me I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad  while the cool kids get to go out and play
Bullshit on that
It ain't like that
Then what's it like, Kim
You guys are our collateral
I really think one human being will be collateral enough
You're not gonna wanna do what we're doing
What, drive a car
Mmm
What, drive it fast
We're doing more than that
But that's okay
We're stunt people
We ain't got good sense
How do you know I don't wanna do it
'Cause you're a mom
Yeah
You know, we're supposed to be this big posse,  but that's the excuse you guys use  whenever you want to exclude me from something
So, what is it you two daredevils are doing that I'm just so uncool,  I couldn't possibly understand
You know, we're kind of conning this guy,  so maybe it's best that we don't go into detail about it while he's watching us
Besides, he's probably not gonna let us do it anyway
How about this
I'll talk him into it
But if I talk him into it, I go along
Eh, that's my problem
But don't worry
He'll say yes
No
I'm gonna insinuate that Lee's gonna blow him
That's good
But let me handle it
We got a deal
Okay, Mommy, listen up
You wanna hang with the cool kids,  you got to be cool
We take you along, you don't say shit
You don't even say crap
Got it
I'm serious now
You start nagging us, we're pulling over to the side of the road,  kicking your ass out and picking you up later
Okay
Go work your magic
Hello, sir
Hello
Hello
What's your name
Hello, Jasper
Aber... what
Abernathy
What's your first name
That is my first name
What kind of first name is that
You know what
Just call me Abbie
Jasper, we were wondering if my friends and I  could take the car out for a little testdrive out on our own
You know, just to see if we're comfortable in it
Why would I do something stupid like that
To better sell your automobile
Four reasons, actually
One, we're not thieves
Three, we're staying at the Days Inn in town
You can call the hotel, check with management
We're registered for the next month
Actually, Zoë's not
Who's Kim
The colored girl
Yes
Kim would be the girl of color
And reason number four, and the most important,  while we're taking the car out for a little spin,  that'll give you a better opportunity to get acquainted  with our other friend, Lee
That would be because she's a famous actress
Oh
Why is she dressed like that
What's a cheerleader movie
A movie about cheerleaders
Is it a porno movie
Yes, it is
But don't mention it
She's shy
Lee, this is Jasper
Now, you two kids stay out of trouble
Hey, goodlookin', be back to pick you up later
Tata
You thinking what I'm thinking
I think I'm thinking it
What are you and you thinking
Where y'all going
You stay put
I gotta take a..
So, you ready to do this
Well, I always don't wanna do it right before I'm gonna do it
You know what I mean
Yeah, I know what you mean, 'cause I don't wanna do it
Kim..
I'm just saying
Look, if you're gonna take the piss out of it..
You wanna start out on top
Practically doesn't count if you start on the top
Here are your gloves
I'm wearing the jacket
This is my jacket
Come on
I'm the one who's on the fucking bonnet
"Bonnet," my ass
You on the hood
Give me your belt
Oh
But this is my cute shit
Get Abernathy's belt
Fine
We'll use Abbie's belt
Give me your belt
No
Prada
Come on, give her the belt
Magic word
Just 'cause you asked nicely
It's nice to be nice, Kim
You know what
Don't even fucking think about asking me next time you want me to do your hair
Your ass gonna do it
Yeah, and you'll ask "pretty please," bitch,  because that's what you do when no one else is looking
I ain't getting that shit
Abernathy, don't get on my nerves right now
I got shit on my mind
Ooh
It's cold
Can we roll up one of these windows
No
Okay, Abernathy
What the fuck are you guys doing
What does that mean
Whoa
Faster, you black bitch
Faster
Is that fast enough for your bony ass
Whoahohoho
Abernathy, get your ass up here
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Go, go, go
Check it out, bitch
You want it fucking faster
Oh, my God

My right arm's broken
This one
Oh, you want some shit
You piece of shit
Bitch
Asshole
♪ Hang up the chick habit ♪  ♪ Hang it up, Daddy, or you'll be alone in a quick ♪   Come on, Abbie
I got this
[horses snorting]   Whoa
Who's that stumblin' around in the dark
State your business or prepare to get winged
Calm yourselves, gentlemen
I mean you no harm
Whoa, boy
Good cold evening, gentlemen
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders  that go by the name of the Speck Brothers
Might that be you
Who wants to know
I'm Dr. King Schultz
This is my horse, Fritz
What kinda doctor
[Schultz] Dentist
And did you purchase those men at the Greenville slave auction
So what
So I wish to parley with you
Speak English
Please forgive me
It is a second language
Now, amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe,  is a specimen I'm keen to acquire
Is there one amongst you who was formerly a resident  of the Carrucan plantation
Who said that
What's your name
Django
Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are
Who are they
Big John
Roger
Sometime they call him Lil Raj
They was overseers at the Carrucan plantation
Not anymore
Tell me...  ...if you were to see any of these three gentlemen again,   would you recognize them
[man] Hey
Stop talkin' to him like that
Like What
My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain..
Speak English, goddamn it
Everybody calm down
I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction
No sale
Now, off with ya
Move it
My good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture  or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention
Last chance, fancy pants
Oh, very well
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,  but I didn't want you to do anything rash  before you had a moment to come to your senses
You goddamn son of a bitch
Well...  And you killed Ace
I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me
And I do believe I have... one, two, three, four...  ...five witnesses who can attest to that fact
No doubt
Now, if you could keep your caterwauling down to a minimum,  I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django
[man] Godfuckin'damn it
As I was saying...  ...if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again, you could recognize 'em
Yeah
So, Mr. Speck
Mr. Speck
How much for young Django here
Oh, could you hold this for a moment
Django
Get up on that horse
Also, if I were you,  I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind
Nigger
Don't you touch my brother's coat
Oh
One hundred... ten... 20...  ...and five...  ...for young Django here
And since he won't be needing it anymore,  I'd like to purchase your brother's nag
Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale
Do you have one
[scoffs]  I thought not
No worries
I come prepared
Thank you
Whoa
Now, as to you poor devils
So, as I see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next,  you gentlemen have two choices
One: Once I'm gone, you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck,  then carry him to the nearest town
Which would be at least 37 miles back the way you came
Or two: You could unshackle yourselves, take that rifle,  put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep,  and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country
Oh, and on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you,  the North Star is that one
Tata
[clucking]  Now wait a minute, fellas
Let's talk about this
I'm not a bad guy
I'm just doin' my job
Tell you what, boys: Take me to the doc in El Paso,   I'll get you your freedom
[gun cocking]   No
No, please...  [gunshot echoing]    All right, now
I'd like you to take two of these tonight...   [coughing]  ...and then in the morning...  That's a nigger on a horse
What's everybody staring at
Whoa
Good morning, innkeeper
Two beers for two weary travelers
We won't be open for another hour
By then, we'll be servin' breakfast
the hell you think you're doing, boy
Get that nigger outta here
[panting] Help
Help
Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshal
Alas
Now we must act as our own bartender
What kind of dentist are you
[chortles]  Despite that cart, I haven't practiced dentistry in five years
Do you know what a bounty hunter is
No
Well...  ...the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash,  a bounty hunter deals in corpses
Prost
The state places a bounty on a man's head
I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man
Sometimes that's easier said than done
I show that corpse to the authorities, proving yes, indeed,  I truly have killed him,  at which point the authorities pay me the bounty
So, like slavery, it's a flesh for cash business
What's a bounty
It's like a reward
And they give you a reward
Certain people, yeah
Bad people
Badder they are, bigger the reward
Which brings me to you
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you
On one hand, I despise slavery
On the other hand, I need your help
So, for the time being, I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey  work to my benefit
Still, having said that, I feel guilty
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers
However, at this endeavor,  I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar as I don't know what they look like
But you do
Don't ya
Good
So here's my agreement
Where we goin'
I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,  but I don't know where
That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find 'em
And when we find them, you point them out, and I kill them
You do that, I agree to give you your freedom,  $25 per Brittle Brother
That's $75
And, as if on cue, here comes the sheriff
Fun's over
Come on out
[overlapping chatter]  All right, folks, calm down
Go about your business
These jokers will be gone soon
And scare all these nice people
You ain't got nothing better to do  than to come into Bill Sharp's town  and show your ass
[metal springing noise]  [sheriff screaming]   [crowd gasping]  [groaning]    What'd you just do to our sheriff
Should we wait inside
Can we just leave
After you
Move that buckboard a long ways across the street from the saloon
I want two men, two rifles up on this roof
Two men, two rifles on that roof
All the barrels aimed at that front door
Somebody get poor Bill outta the goddamn street
You in the saloon
You got one chance to get out of this alive
I have the pleasure of addressing
Yes, it is
This is U.S
Marshal Gill Tatum
Na wunderbar, marshal
I have relieved myself of all weapons,  and just as you have instructed,  I am ready to step outside  with my hands raised above my head
I trust as a representative  of the criminal justice system of the United States of America,  I shan't be shot down in the street by either you or your deputies  before I've had my day in court
Shot him down like a dog in the street
Yes, that's exactly what I mean
Do I have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street
Fair enough, marshal
Here we come
They're a little tense out there
So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking
You unarmed
Marshal Tatum, may I address you and your deputies,  and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey,  as to the incident that just occurred
Go on
My name is Dr. King Schultz
Like yourself, marshal, I'm a servant of the court
The man lying dead in the dirt, who the good people of Daughtrey  saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of Bill Sharp,  is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,  with a price on his head of $200
Now that's $200, dead or alive
I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news
But I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff  sometime in the past two years
Yeah
years ago, he was rustling cattle  from the B.C
Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas
Now, this is a warrant made out by  Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas
He'll back up who I am and who your dear departed sheriff was
I'll be damned
After this Brittle business is behind us,  you'll be a free man, with a horse, $75 in your back pocket...  What's your plan after that
Find my wife, and buy her freedom
Do most slaves believe in marriage
Oh, me and my wife do
Old Man Carrucan didn't
That's why we, uh... we run off
Django, Django  You got sand, Django
Boy's got sand
I got no use for a nigger with sand
I want you to burn a runaway "r" right here on his cheek
And I want you to take 'em to the Greenville auction and sell 'em
Both of 'em
And this one...  ...you will sell him cheap
In Greenville...  ...there should be some sort of a records office
What is her name
Broomhilda
What
Broomhilda
Broomhilda
Hmmm
Were her owners German
Yeah, how you know
She was raised by a German mistress, the Von Shafts
She speak a little German, too
Your wife
When she was little, her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody  to speak German with
Well, let me get this straight
Your slave wife speaks German and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft
Yep
They call me Hildi
You'll be playing a character
No
During the act, you can never break character
Do you understand
Yeah
Don't break character
What that is
That's a fancy word for servant
Valet
Hmmm
And now, Django, you may choose your character's costume
But of course
resumes playing]  Whoa
It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory
This is my valet
I said niggers on horses...  [Schultz] His name is Django
He's a free man
He can ride what he pleases
Not around my niggers, he can't
My good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot
Allow me to unring this bell
This is my valet, Django
And these are our horses, Tony and Fritz
[snorting]  [women giggling]  Mr. Bennett
I've been led to believe that you are a gentleman and a businessman
I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee  to buy one of my nigger gals
No appointment, no nothin'
Well, what if I was to say I don't like you
Or your fancypants nigger
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn
Now what you got to say about that
Mr. Bennett
If you are the businessman I've been led to believe you to be,  I have 5,000 things I might say that could change your mind
Well, come on inside and get yourself somethin' cool to drink
Hmmm
Oh, well, absolutely
Uh, Betina
Yessir, Big Daddy
Uh...  What's your Jimmie's name again
<i>'</i> Django
Betina, sugar, could you take Django there  and take him around the grounds here and show him all the pretty stuff
As you please, Big Daddy
Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you, Django is a free man
He... within the bounds of good taste,  he must be treated as an extension of myself
Understood, Schultz
Yes'm
Django isn't a slave
Django is a free man, you understand
You can't treat him like any of the other niggers around here,  'cause he ain't like any of the other niggers around here
You want I should treat him like white folks
No
That's not what I said
Then I don't know what you want, Big Daddy
Yes, I can see that
Uh...  What's the name of that peckerwood boy from town that works with the glass
Oh, you mean Jerry
That's the boy's name
Jerry
You know Jerry, don't you, sugar
Well, that's it, then
That house we just left from is The Big House
Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big
That there is the pantry
That's where Big Daddy hang all his dead meat
What you do for your massa
Didn't you hear him tell you I ain't no slave
So you really free
Yes, I's free
You mean you wanna dress like that
Betina, I need to ask you somethin'
What you want
Three brothers
Overseers
Their name is Brittle
Brittle
Yes, Brittle
John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj
They could be usin' a different name
They woulda come to the plantation this past year
Maybe
Three brothers
Uhhuh
They here
Uhhuh
Could you point one of 'em out to me
gonna appreciate this, now
She work in the house, John
You could mess her skin up, and you gonna mess her up  and she ain't gonna be worth... she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing
Now, your Bible say...  that I was one that made her do it
You ready
She didn't wanna run off with me
It should be me, John
Now, I been here long enough, you know me, you know me a long time, now
You know Massa Carrucan ain't gonna appreciate this
She a house slave, she can't be...  [screaming]    On my knees
I'm asking you this, please
Ain't this what you want
Now, John, please
L's on my knees, John
I like the way you beg, boy
Is that who you was lookin' for
Yep
They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs
Point me in that direction
You go to that tree and keep goin' thata way
Go get that white man I came here with
[man] Come on, now
No, no, please
[shrieks] Please
Come on
Get you set up now
[screaming]  "And the Lord said, 'The fear of ye..."   [cracking]  "...and the dread of ye  shall be on every beast of the earth."
Come here now, woman
[screaming]  OK, she's ready
And after this, we'll see if you break eggs again
John Brittle
You remember me
[metal springing noise]  I like the way you die, boy
Goddamn son of a bitch
[grunting]    Y'all wanna see somethin'
No
That's Big John, and that's Lil Raj
Where's Ellis
He's the one hightailin' it across that field right now
You sure that's him
Yeah
Positive
You don't know if you're positive
I don't know what "positive" mean
It means you're sure
"Yes," what
Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle
Django
Everybody calm down
We mean no one else any harm
Who are you two jokers
I am Dr. King Schultz, a legal representative  of the criminal justice system of the United States of America
The man to my left is Django Freeman
In my pocket is a warrant,  signed by Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,  for the arrest and capture, dead or alive,  of John Brittle, Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle
They were goin' by the name Shaffer
You know them by the name of Shaffer, but the butchers' real name was Brittle
These are wanted men
The law wants 'em for murder
I realize passions are high,  but I must warn you, the penalty for taking deadly force  against an officer of the court in the performance of his duty  is you'll be hung by the neck until you're dead
Now, may I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it
Satisfied
May I have that back, please
Get off my land
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can and let's get outta here
Yeah, that's them sonsabitches
[dramatic choral music]  [horses snorting, whinnying]   Come on, men
[man 1] We're coming for you, nigger
[man 2] Heehaw
That's way too simple for these jokers
We're gonna whup that niggerlover to death
And I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself
Damn
We ready or what
I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes
[fabric ripping]  Oh... Oh, shit
Who made this goddamn shit
Willard's wife
Well, make your own goddamn masks
Look, nobody's sayin' they don't appreciate what Jenny did
Well, if all I had to do was cut a hole in a bag,  I coulda cut it better than this
What about you, Robert
Not too good
I mean, if I don't move my head I can see you pretty good, more or less
But when I start ridin', the bag's movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind
Shit
I just made mine worse
Oh, God
No, nobody brought an extra bag
I'm just askin'
Do we have to wear 'em when we ride
Oh, well, shitfire
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up, that just defeats the purpose
Well, I can't see in this fuckin' thing
Well, fuck all y'all
I'm goin' home
Now, I watched my wife work all day gettin' 30 bags together  for you ungrateful sonsabitches,  and all I can hear is criticize, criticize, criticize
From now on, don't ask me or mine for nothin'
We got a killer nigger over that hill there
And we gotta make a lesson out of him
Are the bags on or off
I think we all think the bag was a nice idea
Yeah
[mumbling agreements]  But, not pointin' any fingers, they coulda been done better
So how 'bout no bags this time,  but next time we do the bags right and then we go full regalia
I like that idea a lot
Wait a minute
But nobody can see
So
So it'd be nice to see
Goddamn it
This is a raid
I can't see, you can't see
So what
All that matters is can the fuckin' horse see
[overlapping shouts]  [man] Sons of bitches
I can't see shit
And get that niggerlover outta the wagon
That nigger ain't down here, Big Daddy
They tricked us
Well, where are they
Auf Wiedersehen
[all shouting]  [horses whinnying]  Oh
[chuckles]  Bull'seye
[men yelling]  [horses whinnying]   [Django] Look at 'em run
[all shouting]  Yeah, cowards tend to do that
Would you care to
Can't see shit outta this
He's getting away
I got him
I got him
[slowmotion impact sound]  [Big Daddy grunting]  Got him
How you know Broomhilda's first masters was German
If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German
Lots of gals where you're from named Broomhilda
Broomhilda is the name of a character  in the most popular of all the German legends
There's a story about Broomhilda
Oh, yes, there is
Do you know it
Would you like me to tell you
She was a daughter of Wotan, god of all gods
Anyway, her father is really mad at her
What she do
I can't exactly remember
She disobeys him in some way
So he puts her on top of the mountain
It's a German legend,  there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere
And he puts a firebreathing dragon there to guard the mountain
And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire
Unless a hero arises brave enough to save her
Does a fella arise
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact, he does
Does Siegfried save her
Quite spectacularly so
He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it
He slays the dragon, because he's not afraid of him
I know how he feel
I think I'm just starting to realize that
Now, look, Django..
...I don't doubt that one day you'll save your lady love...  ...but I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscience
A slave auction town in Mississippi isn't the place for you to visit
Free or not, it's just too dangerous
How do you like the bounty hunting business
Kill white folks and they pay you for it
What's not to like
Now, I have to admit, we make a good team
Yeah, on that occasion you were a tad overzealous,  but normally, that's a good thing
How'd you like to partner up for the winter
What you mean "partner up"
...I give you a third of my bounties
So we make some money this winter, and when the snow melts,  I'll take you to Greenville myself  and we'll find where they sent your wife
Why you care what happen to me
Frankly..
...I've never given anybody their freedom before
And now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you
As a German, I'm obliged to help you on your quest  to rescue your beloved Broomhilda
Ooh
What happened to Mr. "I Wanna Shoot White Folks For Money"
His son's with him
Well, good
He'll have a loved one with him
Maybe even share a last word
That's better than most of them get
Put down the rifle
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill
Read it aloud
Consider that today's lesson

If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at 22,  they would never have printed that
But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches  and he didn't mind killing people to do it
Do you want to save your wife by doing what I do
I kill people and sell their corpses for cash
This corpse is worth $7,000
Now quit your pussyfooting and shoot him
Pa
Here
You need to keep this Smitty Bacall handbill
Why
It's good luck
You always keep the handbill of your first bounty
[horses whinny]  [overlapping gunshots]    Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya
Who the hella you got there
Who the hell is the WilsonLowe Gang
Huh
Well, just leave 'em out here, they ain't going nowhere
Why don't you come in then out of the snowy snow  and get yourselves some coffee
We had a birthday yesterday
Got some cake
Move it, boy
Get on up on that auction block
Keep going
Keep goin'
"Broomhilda Von Shaft
Age 27
Calvin Candie
He owns the fourth biggest cotton plantation in Mississippi: Candyland
Candyland
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland
Well, apparently, that's where your wife is...   [sighs]  ...and that's the repellant gentleman  who owns her
Let's just hope she works in the house, not in the field
Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger
She... she pretty
And she talk good, too
[sizzling]  [screaming]  She ain't no field nigger but she ain't good enough  for the house no more either
What's a comfort...
Oh
Not while I got freedom
Not while I got my gun
So do we offer to buy her
Needs to buy a horse
He walks up to the farmer's farm, and he knocks on the farmer's door  and asks the farmer to buy his horse
And do you know what the farmer says
The farmer says no
Well, I say fuck that farmer, and I'm stealin' that horse
Fair enough
Not to mention the horse goes back to its original owner  because the horse is still his property
We need her and we need a bill of sale
May I offer an alternative plan of action
Go ahead
So... the man walks up to the farmer's farm,  he knocks on the farmer's door...  ...and asks not to buy the horse, but the farm
And makes an offer so ridiculous,  the farmer is forced to say yes
No, it's far too big
But apparently this farmer ain't all about the farm
How much do you know about Mandingo fighting
What
Why
<i>[Schultz] Because my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,</i>  <i>here in Greenville to buy my way into the Mandingo fight game.</i>  <i>And your character is a Mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.</i>  <i>[Django] They call that "OneEyed Charley
"</i>  Bonjour
We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie
<i>Entraz.</i>   Thank you
Hmmm
You want me to play a black slaver
A black slaver is lower than the head house nigger...  ...and, buddy, that's pretty fuckin' low
Then play him that way
Give me your black slaver
Toot
Peanut butter!</i>   Dr. Schultz
Mr. Moguy
Thank you for your assistance in creating the opportunity   for this appointment
Nonsense, it's my job
So this is the OneEyed Charley I've heard so much about
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer, Leonide Moguy
Just call me Leo
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room
You all wanna follow me
were about 11  when we went to boarding school together
Calvin's father's father put me through law school
One could almost say I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer
One could almost say youse a nigger
What did you say
I said..
Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie that I should know before I meet him
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile
What civilized people aren't
He doesn't speak French
Don't speak French to him, it'll embarrass him
There you go
There you go
Why do you want to get in the Mandingo business
You don't intend to allow your second to make the proper introductions
Quit stalling, now
Answer the question
The awful truth
This seems like a good bit of fun
Well, come on over
We got us a fight goin' on that's a good bit of fun
Won't you accompany me to the bar
Even I know that
Dr. Schultz
What a rare pleasure
Keep fighting, niggers
Honor to meet you
Please have a seat, the pleasure's all mine
Get free man Django here whatever he wants
And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon
There you go
He's much bigger and stronger
Come on, now
He's not doing what I told him, for God's sakes
It's a fight to the death
[grunting]  You either hit him or are you ain't
Big Fred, come on
[grunting]   Come on, now
There you go
Look at that
Do what I told you, boy
There you go
[bones cracking]   No
[Calvin] Do what I told ya
Blind him black
Oh, no, Luigi
[screaming]   Whoo
Whoohoohoo
[screaming]  Oh...   [panting]  [man continues screaming]    Finish him
Go on, boy, finish him
call him Big Fred
Well, arrivederci, Luigi
Get yourself a rest
You did a fine job
A real fine job
Mercedes
What's your name
Django
Can you spell it
The D is silent
I know
take care of my new boy here
You find him a room with a soft bed,  then you bring him up a pony to lick his pole
But you be ready to travel to Candyland tomorrow morning, now, ya hear
Before you go, Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer
You enjoy that, boy
You've earned it
Yessir
What's your name, boy
His name is Django Freeman
Where'd you dig him up
I've heard tell about you
I heard you been telling everybody them Mandingos ain't no damn good
Ain't nothin' nobody is sellin' is worth buyin'
I'm curious... what makes you such a Mandingo expert
What did you say, boy
No offense given...  ...none taken
...I'd appreciate if you could direct your line of inquiry toward me
One...  ...you do not have anything to drink
Yes
I'll have a beer
Wunderbar
Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard,  and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver
Do not spare the rum
Doc..
I am a seasoned slaver
You are, well, you are a neophyte
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie..
I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger  at above topdollar market price
Now I was under the impression, when you granted me an audience,  it would be to discuss business
Well, we weren't talkin' business yet
Thank you
go outside and play
Sheba... you stay right there
I know you didn't mean me
German
Now, according to Moguy, if I do business with you,  I'm doing business with both y'all
He does the eyeballin', you the billfold
Is that it
Well, you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yeah
Hm
So..
Not for top dollar
Well, then, we got nothin' more to talk about
You see, you wanna buy a beatass nigger from me,  those are the beatass niggers I wanna sell so..
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell
Well, I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell
Well, you won't sell your best
You won't even sell your second best
You don't want to sell him either
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be forced to consider it...  ...who knows what could happen
And what do you consider ridiculous
How much would you say, Django
Twelve thousand dollars
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,  but now you have my attention
Willie
Willie
Hold up
Ah
Good morning, gentlemen
Good Dr. Schultz
Beautiful morning, isn't it
You couldn't have picked a better one
You can tie your horse up back there
Where I part company from many of my phrenologist colleagues  is I believe there is a level above bright, above talented,  above loyal that a nigger can aspire to
Say, one nigger that just pops up in 10,000
The exceptional nigger
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy
Sun is up
[Calvin] Have a seat, doc
[Schultz] Thank you
The honor is all ours
Thank you
<i>[Calvin] But I do believe that, given time,</i>  exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here...  ...become if not frequent...  ...more frequent
Bright Boy, you are that one in 10,000
The name of the game is keep up, not catch up, nigger
Whoa
[whinnying]   Touch your guns, you die
Now I saw the whole thing
Are you kidding me
This nigger just..
I said no harm done
Now take your hand off your pistol
Butch, that means you too
Hoot
Get back up on your horse
He broke my collarbone
For God's sake, somebody please help Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse
[man] Yessir, boss
Oh, now you are one lucky nigger
Oh, I'm gonna go walking in the moonlight with you
You wanna hold my hand
Willie, take us home
Head 'em out
You got a problem with your eyeball, boy
You want a boot heel in it
No, sir
Then you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me
You flash that bad look at me again, I'll give you a reason not to like me
You niggers are gonna understand something about me
You get the molasses out your ass, you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me
He is a rambunctious sort, ain't he
[chuckles]  Indeed
May we stop for a moment so I may put a word in my man's ear
You know, I'm expecting to fall in love once I see the specimens at Candyland,  so before that moment, it would be good if I could have  a confidential strategy meeting with my confidant
You mind telling me what the hell you doing
You're sure it's her
Now, while it's not wise to assume,  in this instance, I think it's pretty safe
Point being, don't get so carried away with your retribution
You lose sight of why we're here
You think I lost sight of that
Yes, I do
You're going to blow this whole charade, or more than likely get us both killed
And I, for one, don't intend to die in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA
I'm not antagonizing him
I'm intriguing him
You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves
I recall the man who had me kill another man in front of his son  and he didn't bat a eye
You remember that
What you said was that this is my world...  ...and in my world you gotta get dirty
So that's what I'm doing
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...  ...that was the general gist
See you at Candyland
All right, niggers, back at it
That means you too, Moonlight
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie
You might not be able to win, but your ass can fight
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please shut these goddamn dogs up
I cannot hear myself think
Quiet down, Marsha
Marsha
Hush up
Hey
Come on now, boy... get on out that tree
Yessir
How long was he loose
Day
Half the other night
How far he get off the property
'Bout 20 miles off the prop
Hm
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday
Onea this new lot
Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian wouldn't bet a bead on him
Candie, I ain't got it in me no more
I can't...  Now, no beggin'
No playin' on my soft heart
You in trouble now, son
Yessir
I done paid $500 for you
When I pay $500, then I expect to get five fights out of a nigger   'fore he roll over and play dead
You got to understand that I'm runnin' a business here
But I won every one
Yes, you did
Yes, you did
But that last one, you muddled the line between winnin' and losin'
Yessir
Still, the fact remains:  I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights
What about my $500
You gonna reimburse me
You even know what "reimburse" means
[laughing]  [Calvin] Huh
You Will
Yep
You'll pay $500  for practically a oneeyed old Joe ain't fit to push a broom
He just tired of you toyin' with him is all
Matter of fact, so am I
But we ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny
Ain't that right, doc
You heard him
You're gonna have to excuse Mr. Stonesipher's slackjawed gaze
He ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life
That right
...nor have I
Now...  ...seein' as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here...  ...you won't mind me handlin' this nigger any way I see fit
Mr. Stonesipher
Let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven
Marsha
Marsha, hey, get him
[barks echoing]  Get 'im, get 'im
Yeah
Whoo
[dogs snarling]  [screaming]  Your boss looks a little green around the gills  for a blood sport like nigger fighting
Nah, he just ain't used to seein' a man ripped apart by dogs is all
Hm
I'm just a little more used to Americans than he is
Hm
We rode five hours so you could show off your stock
Let's get to it
'Cause as of now, if he's an example, I ain't impressed
Follow me
Line 'em up to the left here now, boy
Stand up straight, now
Get up there, boy
Come on
Give me a line
Give me a line
Get in line there
Straighten up
Stephen, my boy
Hello, my ass
Who this nigger up on that nag
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast
What'sa matter
Why you so ornery
You miss me, huh
[laughs]  I miss you like a hog miss slop
Like a baby miss mammy's titty
[all chuckling]  I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe
Hey, Snowball
Wanna know my name or the name of my horse, you ask me
I'll snatch your black ass off that nag there   and in the mud so fast...  Whoa, whoa, whoa
...make your head spin
Stephen, Stephen, Stephen
Let's keep it funny
Django here's a free man
That nigger there
Let me at least introduce the two of you
Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen
Stephen, this here's Django
You two oughta hate each other
Django and his friend in gray here, Dr. Schultz, are customers
And they are our guests, Stephen
And you, you old decrepit bastard, oughta show them every hospitality
You understand that
Him I understand
But I don't know why I got to take lip off this nigger
Do you understand
Yessir
I understand
Well,good
Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready
He gonna stay in The Big House
Stephen, he's a slaver
It's different
In The Big House
Well, you got a problem with that
I ain't got no problem with it,  if you ain't got no problem with burnin' the bed, the sheets,  the pillowcases, everything else when this blackass motherfucker's gone
That is my problem
They are mine to burn
Now your problem right now is makin' a good impression
And I want you to start solvin' that problem right now  and get them goddamn rooms ready
Go on, now
Can't believe you brought a nigger to stay in The Big House
Your daddy rollin' over in his goddamned grave
Man, the lip on him
He's gettin' worse and worse
Now...  Where is my beautiful sister?
Whoohoohoohoo
Dr. Schultz, this attractive Southern belle is my widowed sister
Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes
May I present to you Lara Lee CandieFitzwilly
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly
Y'all get your ass over by that pen
Come on, Charly
Let's go
Like you on a rope
Niggers don't walk around here, niggers run
Monsieur Candie
Hm
Yeah
Nigger gal
Yeah, I believe you mentioned she spoke German
Ah, yes
Do you think before the demonstration, you could send her around to my room
I don't see why not
Stephen, when you get through showin' them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,  get her cleaned up and smellin' real nice,  and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room here
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,  there'sa somethin' I ain't told you 'bout yet
What
[stammers] Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box
She bein' punished
[Calvin] What she do
[Stephen] She run off again
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people ran away while I was gone
Two
They brung her back this morning
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up
they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass
Bill and Cody went lookin' for her, found her, brung her back
But she done that to her own damn self  runnin' through them damn bushes and shit
How long she been in the box
she been in there
All damn day
And the little bitch got ten more days to be in there
Still, take her out
Why
Because I said so, that's why
Dr. Schultz is my guest
Hildi is my nigger
Southern hospitality dictates I make her available to him
Jesus Christ, Stephen
What is the point of havin' a nigger that speaks German  if you can't wheel 'em out when you have a German guest
Yessir
Will you and Cora be responsible  for gettin' Hildi cleaned up and presentable for Dr. Schultz here
Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am weary from our travels beyond words
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes
Y'all done heard the man
Get her ass up outta there
Come here
Shoots
Schultz
Schultz
Get her back over here
Hurry up, girl
Yessir
[soft guitar music plays]   Come on, girl
Stand up
Hello, ladies
May I introduce to you Broomhilda
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda
I've heard a lot of good things about you
Well, it's not every nigger speaks German, don't ya know
[chuckles]  [forced chuckle]  As I look at you now, Broomhilda,  I can see all the passions you inspire are completely justified
The doctor here speaks German
Go ahead, girl
Speak a little German
Ha
[laughs]  Astonishing
Hm
Pardon
<i>Danke.</i>    Hey, Little Trouble Maker
You silvertongued devil, you
Hurry up, girl
These ready, Miss Cora
Go downstairs, get the big jug with the red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear
Get your big pretty ass out the way
You know you like it
Ooh
Come on with these biscuits, girl
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it
But the best three by far were Samson...   What's that other one's name
Goldie
Goldie
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe
these nigger nicknames get started
His name was Joe, maybe one day he said he was cold
Who knows
We all know that
You will never sell him, and I can see why
He's a champion
All three are champions
Samson's the champion
Them other two pretty good
It's all right
You have to understand, Monsieur Candie,  while admittedly a neophyte in the nigger fight game,  I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus
Is that right
Hence, I have big ideas when it comes to presentation
I need something more than just a big nigger
Yeah, he needs to have panache
Need to have what
What
Panache
Uh...   A sense of Showmanship
Showmanship, yes
More like Niggerles
I said, and I quote: "I would pay top dollar for...  ...'the right nigger."
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger, per se
But is he right as rain
Oh, Dr. Schultz,  I will have you know there is no one in the nigger fight game  that appreciates the value of showmanship  more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie here
Nobody
But one must not forget the most important thing   in the nigger fight game
And that is a nigger that can win fights
Hmmm
Now that should be your first, second, third, fourth, and fifth concern
Now, after you have that, and you know you have that,  then you can start to implement a grand design
First thing's first
Ooh
I see you two gettin' on
Famously
Well, hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston
Two weeks in Boston
Monsieur Candie, you a mess
[coughing]   I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue
And Hildi is a charming conversation companion
Hm
a powerful emotion, boy
[Stephen] Hm
It's like a pool of black tar
Once it catches your ass, you're caught
Yessir, you stuck
[laughs]   You can lay on all the German sweet talk you want,  but it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django
Well, naturally
You are quite the dapper European gentleman
you got to put your elbow in these dishes, you hear me
You know that nigger, don't you
Who
"Who?
You know who I'm talkin' about
At the table
I don't know him
No
"No," what
No, sir
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you
If you say so
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it
But if it was my money, I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him
What would your price be
Well, if I was inclined to be generous...  ...and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous...  ...9,000
Maybe
You see, it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger
Sure wasn't
It was you who approached me to buy one
Sure was
And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that,   I could do so any day of the week
Any day
But, like you said in Greenville, doctor..
I don't want to sell him
It was only your ridiculous offer of $12,000   that made me even consider it
Hmmm
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal
Eskimo Joe, $12,000
[banging table] Hooray, doctor
Hooray
However, that is a tremendous amount of money
And the way you have your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer
Persnickety man named Tuttle
Hmmm
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined   by a physician of my choosing
[Calvin] Naturally
So, say I return in about...   ...five days time
Five days
And then my Mr. Tuttle and your Mr. Moguy  can hash out the finer details between themselves
Splendid
Gentlemen...  ...may I propose a toast
To Eskimo Joe
Or shall we call him The Black Hercules
To The Black Hercules
You was right, doctor
That name do have panass
[chuckles]  Hm
Hildi, top my drink off
When Monsieur Candie talk to you, you answers
I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie
Hmmm
It's a lot better than sizzlin' in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass  through a bramble bush
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,   huh, sugar bear
Oh, Lord, she like them niggers
Like Samson
You know, Monsieur Candie,  the doctor here might be interested in seein' Hildi's peeled back,  seein' as how they don't have many niggers where he come from
Dr. Schultz, when you was alone with Hildi, here,  did you just speak German or did you get to take her clothes off
No, we just talked and...  haven't seen her back
I haven't...  No, no, no, no
Stephen's right, you might find this interesting
Hildi, go on, take off your dress
Show Dr. Schultz your back here
[Lara Lee] Uh, Calvin
I just got her all dressed up and lookin' nice
They don't got niggers there
He is a man of medicine
I'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers' endurance for pain
These niggers are tough, Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it
Lara Lee just get one, she'd lose her goddamn mind
[Stephen] Sure would
It's like a paintin'
Look at that
Calvin
We are eating
Ain't no one wanna look at her whipped up back
[exhales]  Fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine
After dinner, then, Stephen
Cora, come get this girl
[Lara Lee] She a mess
Yes, ma'am
[gasps] Oh
Why are you all undone
Come on in here
Baby, you on Stephen bad side, and you need to be on his blind side
You say you ain't know him
Huh
I said, you said you ain't know him
I don't
Yes, you do
...I don't
Why is you lying to me
I ain't
You scarin' me
Why is I'm scaring you
Because you scary
this afternoon with Hildi  was positively soulenriching
You stay right here
you'd be willing to part with Hildi
Yessiree bob, I did
In that case, allow me to propose another proposition
I'm all ears
Hurry up, goddamn it
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here
My ears ain't worth a damn these days
Excuse him
Monsieur Candie, could I get a word with you in the kitchen
You mean get up out of my chair
If'n you could manage it
It's about dessert
What about dessert
I'd rather discuss that in private
We're having white cake
You right, Monsieur Candie
You right
I'll handle it myself
I just can't understand why you won't come talk to these niggers
Shit get fucked up around here, you blame me
Fine
Friend Stephen, I will be along momentarily
Yessir
Well, gentlemen, as you can see,  talented as they are, no doubt, in the kitchen,  from time to time, adult supervision is required
the dinner service
Get
Hurry up, girl
What is the matter
They wants that girl
[chuckling]  Stephen, what the hell are you talking about
Hm
They playing your ass for a fool is what I'm talking about
They ain't here for no musclebound Jimmie
Wh... What girl
Hildi
Yeah, Hildi
Her and Django, them niggers know each other
He just bought Eskimo Joe
Did he give you any money
Not yet
Not yet, nohow
But he's just about to buy  who he come here to buy when I interrupted him
"Thank you, Stephen.
You're welcome, Calvin
Why would they go through all that trouble for a nigger  with a chewed up back, ain't worth $300
They doin' it 'cause that nigger Django's in love with Hildi
She probably his wife
Now, why that German gives a fuck who that uppity son of a bitch  is in love with, I'm sure I don't know
If she's who they want...  ...why this whole snake oil pitch about Mandingos, then
But that 12,000
That made you real friendly, now, didn't it
Yes, it did
His wife, huh
Those lying...  ...goddamn timewastin' sons of bitches
Sons of bitches
...out of New Orleans, so I have quite a bit of practice with theater types
Oh, there you are
I was beginning to think that you and that old crow run off together
Lara Lee, I was just looking out the big window
Billy Crash is out there dealing with some shady slaver  trying to sell a passel of ponies
Would you be a dear, go out there and give them gals an eyeball
Hm
Of course, brother
Thank you, darling
Business never sleeps
Hmmm
Apropos, before your exit,  we were discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda
Ah, yes
And we will again
In a moment
Who's your little friend
He's a old Joe that lived around here for a long time
And I do mean a long damn time
Till he up and keeled over one day...  ...Old Ben took care of me
Growing up the son of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi  puts a white man in contact with a whole lotta black faces
I spent my whole life here, right here in Candyland...  ...surrounded by black faces
Now, seeing them every day, day in, day out,  I only had one question:   Why don't they kill us
Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda cut my daddy's goddamn throat  and it wouldn't have taken me no 50 years to do it, neither
But he never did
Why not
You see, the science of phrenology  is crucial to understanding the separation of our two species
In the skull of the African here,  the area associated with submissiveness  is larger than any human or any other subhuman species on planet Earth
Here, here and here
Now...  ...if I was holding the skull of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,  these three dimples would be found in the area of the skull  most associated with... creativity
But this is the skull of Old Ben
And in the skull of Old Ben,  unburdened by genius,  these three dimples exist in the area of the skull most associated with...  ...servility
Now, Bright Boy..
But if I took this hammer here...  ...and I bashed in your skull with it...  ...you would have the same three dimples in the same place...  ...as Old Ben
Hey
If you lift those palms off that turtle shell tabletop,  Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawedoff
There have been a lot of lies said around this dinner table here tonight,  but that you can believe
Mr. Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect the pistol  hanging off these boys' hips here
Thank you ever so much
Where were we
Jackass
Ah, yes
I do believe you were just getting ready to make me  a proposition to buy Broomhilda
Right
Bring out Hildi
Get over there yonder
[screams]  Sit your ass in that goddamn...  flat on that tabletop
To which me myself said, "What is your definition of ridiculous?
To which you said, "$12,000.
[yells]  Now, considering y'all  have ridden a whole lot of miles,  went through a whole lot of trouble, and done spread a whole lot of bull  to purchase this lovely lady right here,  it would appear that Broomhilda is, in fact... the right nigger
And if y'all want to leave Candyland with Broomhilda,  the price is $12,000
Yes, I do, doctor
You see, under the laws of Chickasaw County,  Broomhilda here is my property
And I can choose to do with my property whatever I so desire
And if y'all think my price...  ...for this nigger here is too steep...   [grunts]  ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...  ...take this goddamn hammer here and beat her ass to death with it
Right in front of both y'all
Then we can examine the three dimples inside Broomhilda's skull
Now, what's it gonna be, doc
Huh
May I lift the hands off the tabletop in order to remove my billfold
Yes, you may
That 12
[screaming]  To the man with the exceptional beard  and his unexceptional nigger
Mr. Moguy
Yes, Calvin
Will you make these gentlemen a receipt for $12,000, please
$12,000
It was a pleasure doing business with y'all
Now, gentlemen...  ...if you care to join me in the parlor...  ...we will be serving white cake
Excuse me
Could you please stop playing Beethoven
Take your hands off the harp
Doctor, you can't go in there
Stephen, Stephen
Let it be
He's just a little upset, that's all
I'll handle this
White cake
I don't go in for sweets, thank you
Hm
Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today
D'Artagnan
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this
Come again
He wrote The <i>Three</i> Musketeers
Yes, of course, doctor
I figured you must be an admirer
You named your slave after his novel's lead character
Now, if Alexandre Dumas had been there today,  I wonder what he would have made of it
You doubt he'd approve, huh
His approval would be a dubious proposition at best
Softhearted Frenchie
Alexandre Dumas is black
Are these Broomhilda's papers
Of course
Thank you
That is her bill of sale, her ownership history,  and, of course, her freedom papers, doctor
Would you have ink and pen for me
Right over there on that little table
Thank you
Broomhilda Von Shaft...  ...consider yourself a free woman
Mr. Candie...  ...normally, I would say auf Wiedersehen
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually means is "till I see you again"  and since I never wish to see you again,  to you, sir..
I say, "goodbye.
Let's go
Come on
What
It's a custom here in the South...  ...once a business deal is concluded that the two parties shake hands
It implies good faith
But you are...  ...in my house, doctor
So I'm afraid I must insist
On what
That I shake your hand
Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction
You know what I think you are
What you think I am
I think you are a bad loser
And I think you're an abysmal winner
Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw County, a deal ain't done  until the two parties have shook hands
Even after all that paper signin', don't mean shit...  ...you don't shake my hand
If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away $12,000
I don't think so
If she tries to leave here before this niggerloving German shakes my hand,  you cut her ass down
You really want me to shake your hand
I insist
If you insist
Calvin
I'm sorry
I couldn't resist
Ni99er's gone crazy
Help
[screaming]  Help, he's killing everyone
[gunshot]  [Screaming]  Ah
Shit
Get the...
[screaming continues]   What...
Fucking...  Goddamn it
What the fuck is going on
[screams]  You shot me
[man] Sorry, Jessie
Who the fuck gave a nigger a goddamn gun
Nigger
Motherfucker
Shit
Shit
Hold your fire
Stop shootin', goddamn it
What
We got your woman
Billy Crash here got his pistol upside her head
[gasping]  You don't stop all that carrying on,   he gonna blow her goddamn brains out
[gasping]  And that ain't no threat, horse boy
That there is a promise
Or...  ...you can give up, throw your gun out...   ...we won't kill Hildi
Honest lnjun, Django
I swear 'fore God
You give up, ain't no harm gonna come to her
And I'm supposed to believe your black ass
I believe if you don't give up in the next ten seconds,  we gonna blow this bitch's brains out
Believe that
Don't do it
[sniffling] You give me up
Just let me go
Seven
[Hildi] Django
[Stephen] Eight
I love you
[Django] Hold it
No
<i>L</i> give UP  I can't hear you, nigger
I said I give up
[sobbing]  No
Cockadoodledo, nigger
So y'all bounty hunters, huh
We found your wanted posters...  ...and book of figures in your saddlebags
I got to say..
...I ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before
Black boy paid to kill white men
How'd you like that line of work
Probably pretty good while it lasted, huh
Time to say good night to them nuts, blackie
[yelling]  On three
Two...   [screaming]  Calm down, now, here it comes
[screaming] " [Stephen] Captain
Miss Lara want to see you
Something to do with the Old Man's funeral
She gonna give him to the LeQuint Dickey people
Well, she didn't waste a minute telling me
This here what you take with you
Your black ass has been all them motherfuckers at The Big House  could talk about for the last few hours
Now, mind you, most of them ideas had to do with fuckin' with your fun parts
Now, that may seem like a good idea, but truth is...  ...when you snip a nigger's nuts,  most of them bleed out in, oh, about, hm... seven minutes
Most of 'em
Well, more than most
Then I says: "Shitfire
The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that.
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos.
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs.
We do that shit all the time
Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that.
Lo and behold,  out of nowhere, Miss Lara come up with the bright idea  of giving your ass to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company
And as a slave of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,  henceforth, till the day you die,  all day, every day,  you will be swinging a sledgehammer,  turning big rocks into little rocks
One word of sass, they cuts out your tongue
And they good at it too
You won't bleed out
Oh, they does that real good
They gonna work ya
All day, every day, till your back give out
Then they're gonna hit you in the head with a hammer,  throw your ass down the nigger hole
the golden rule, Frankie, eh
You don't root abos
Hey, white boy
I said, hey, white boy
Shut up, black
Do what, now
I said how'd you like to make $11,000
11,500, actually
What the fuck are you talking about
And y'all rode right past it
You be damned, blackie, we're not bandits
I ain't saying that
Nice thing about this fortune is it ain't illegal
You got to earn it, white boy
You got something to say, mate, you say it
The $11,500 fortune waitin' for you back at Candyland  is in the form of a "Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty  on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,  the Bacall Gang
There's a $7,000 "Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,  $1,500 for each of his three accomplices:  Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,  and Crazy Craig Koons
Now, all four of them gentlemen,  they back there at Candyland laughing their ass off
'Cause they just got away with murder
But it ain't got to be that way
You and your mates, y'all can ride back there and y'all can go get that money
What'd these jokers do again
These sons of bitches, they killed innocent people
Innocent white people
I got the handbill right here in my pocket, if you let me get it
Get it out
[man 2] But you're a slave
[man 1] "...and stagecoach robbery.
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave
[man 1] "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall.
Hm
[man 2] That's a shitload
I'm a bounty hunter
Yesterday, as a free man,  I rode into Candyland on a horse with my German white partner,  Dr. King Schultz
We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way from Texas to Chickasaw County
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest
And all y'all know I ain't supposed to be on this trip
But them four men is still back there, they're still wanted,  and that 11,500 is up for grabs, and the last thing they'd expect  is y'all ridin' back in there and gettin' it
You tell us who they are and we turn you loose
No,no,no,no
I ain't gonna tell you who they are
But, you give me a pistol, one of them horses,  and $500 of that 11,500, and I'll point 'em out to you
Now just 'cause it's a real handbill  doesn't mean that other bunch of malarkey is
Now why would a slave have a "Wanted Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket
Did that black ride into Candyland yesterday
All right, I'm gonna ask you again
I want you to remember, I don't like liars
Yeah
They walked us from the Greenville auction,  and he rode in on a horse with a white man
He weren't no slave
You fuckin' sure about that
Damn sure
What happened over in Candyland
Massa got shot
Who shot him
The German
Why'd he do that
Nigger and the German was actin' like they were slavers but they wasn't
Bounty hunters
Fuck me, Roy
I mean, this could be big, mate
Well, smoke, you got a deal
I got one more condition
Hey... [laughs]  ...you're a funny bugger
Cut him loose
Yeah, yeah
You got yourself a deal, blackie
Hey
[laughs]  You're all right for a black fella
Oh, yeah
There we go
There you go, mate
Yeah
What them saddlebags got in 'em
Dynamite
No
I can understand that
Frankie, why don't you take them sticks off that horse  and stick 'em in the nigger cage
A little dynamite for you black fellas to play with
Yeah, right
Why don't you give him your gun and gun belt
Righto
Now, don't drop the fuckin' thing, all right
I've just had the sights fixed and they're perfect
Oh, that's good to know
[all yelling]  [horses whinnying]   Throw me up that dynamite
[man] Jake
Get out there and see what's wrong with them goddamn dogs
[gunshots]  [shouting]   Hey
[grunting]    Auf Wiedersehen
Would you prepare us some coffee
Sheba, you help her
<i>[Django] ♪ Byandby</i>  <i>♪ Oh... A'</i>  Oh, y'all gonna be together with Calvin in the byandby, all right
Just a bit sooner than y'all was expectin'

Now, where were we

Last time I seen you, you had your hands on my...    Django
You black son of a bitch
Oh, no
Not you, Stephen
You right where you belong
Cora, before you go, will you tell Miss Lara goodbye
Do what now
Bye, Miss Lara

You know, before now I didn't know that burgundy was my color
I count six shots, nigger
You said in 76 years on this plantation,  you seen all mannera shit done to niggers
But I notice, you didn't mention kneecappin'
Oh, God
Motherfucker
Damn it
[Stephen groaning]  How many niggers you think you see come and go, huh
Seven thousand
Nine thousand
Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninetynine
Every single word that came out of Calvin Candie's mouth  was nothin' but horseshit
But he was right about one thing: I am that one nigger in 10,000
You son of a bitch
You ain't gonna get away with this, Django
They gonna catch your black ass
You gonna be on the wanted posters now, nigger
The bounty hunters gonna be lookin' for you
You can run, nigger, but they gonna find your ass
And when they do, oh, Lord, what they gonna do to your ass
This Candyland, nigger
You can't destroy Candyland

That's right, I do, and I'm addicted
So, welcome to this week's edition of "Who is a Hypocrite?
This is my first guest
You're not my mother
Yes, I am
Ahh
Mmm
Yes
Thank you
Oh, you little stinker  Oh, you sweet little muffin  Yes, Mama loves the baby
I'm lookin' for the room f or makin' love
You must mean the honeymoon suite
Well, it's straight that way
Can't miss it
Uhhuh
I know where it is
I just wanted you to know that I know where I'm goin', so you needn't bother with me
Where's your luggage
I travel light
Tell me, how long have the others been here
About an hour
You're very late, Eva
I'm sorry, Athena
I was attending a birth
The placenta was late in coming
Which birth is more important to you, Eva: that of a mortal,  or that of a goddess
Wait
We need... fresh rosemary from the kitchen
Mostly what we need is from the kitchen
Hey
Are you listening
Rosemary
We need sea salt, a little bit of sea salt
A bottle of spring water French, not that ltalian shit
Um, yes, and could I have some French fries
[Blonde] Shut up, Kiva
Some ginger and some raw meat
Liver, if you have it
Shut up, you little shit
Hey
Don't talk to her that way
Uh,  if there's nothing else   Thank you
Diana, O Great Beautiful One,  we make these off erings to you...  so that we may undo the wicked spell which deprived you...  of the seed of your lover...  of your virginal blood...  of your very lif e.  We now f orm the symbolic rock...  with our bodies
O Goddess Bride,  we off er thee...  milk from a mother's sweet titty
To reverse this evil which has been done,  I make this off ering...  to the Divine One
A whore not,  an innocent was,  f or whom I seized a virgin's blood
Goddess of Light, Goddess of Lust,  to undo this awful spell is a real must
[Sighs]  [Women Sighing]  O Diana, O Great One,  we live without sun...  until this wicked curse is undone
ln hope that you appear,  I have collected a year's worth of tears
Goddess Diana, f ail you, I will
I was to bring you fresh sperm from my Bill
[All Moaning]  I had him erect, and his semen would f ollow,  but alas, I was hot,  so hot that I swallowed
You swallowed the sperm
You did
Why didn't you use your hands
Well, it just goes to show you what an amazing lack of control you have, Eva
your mama teach you not to put them things in your mouth
I understand, though
[Athena] Eva,  you got one hour to find me some sperm,   one hour to show me...  [Sobbing]  what kind of witch you can be
Uhhuh
[Knocking At Door]  [Man] Ted, the bellhop
Mr. Bellboy,  come right in
Okay, mister
You have to make our little Eva smile

Look, they don't care if I smile or not
They just want  You wouldn't understand
Try me
Well,  the five of us  Athena, Jezebel, Raven, Elspeth and me are a coven
Like a coven of witches
Oh
You see,  f or 40 years we've been trying to...  reverse an evil spell that was placed on our goddess Diana
lt was here in this very room on her wedding night...  that a jealous rival placed this curse on Diana
Her husband was turned into a pink fish,  while our dear goddess...  a stone in her honeymoon bed
This was Diana
[Eva] She's the blonde
Ah
Hmm
Well
Ooh
Say
Oh
Well
Hate to tell you this, but, uh,  I kinda doubt she was a virgin
lf she doesn't get his goop in ten minutes, I'm gonna go in there and get it myself
That'd be a first for you
And now...  you're my last chance
WWhoa
Uhuh
No way
Besides,  it's against hotel policy
I was warned
Oh
See, what I really wanna do is be a midwif e.  I've attended f our births already
I can prevent vaginal tears and everything
Really
That's good
Yes
I joined the coven to obtain greater understanding of my f eminine powers
Oh, really
Seems to be working
Oh
Yeah
Oh, God

The boss
Oh, good

Untie me
[Man] Jesus, honey
I would appreciate it...  Where'd you put the Percodan
if you would tell that nut case in there...  he's making a big fucking mistake
Look, whether you like it or not,  you are in the middle of a situation here you cannot just wish your way out of
But I've never met you people bef ore

Just trying to help her breathe a little
You don't mind my calling you Teddy, do you

You know, once upon a time..
His name was Teddy
He looked real cute nibblin' on Angela's ear
But you're no bunny rabbit, and picturing you do it...  really fuckin' razzes me
But don't let me stop you
Nibble, Teddy
Start nibblin', motherfucker

Don't be shy
Good boy
What's the problem, Sparky
No whiz left in the cheese
Look, I'm not playing this game anymore
Then you can go home to Mommy,   Theodore
The name's Ted
Yes, my mother did me the disservice of naming me Theodore,  and I haven't a clue as to how you know that, because everybody who knows that...  is thousands of fucking miles away
Have you any idea,  the f aintest idea,  what it's like to arrive at school and find yourself surrounded by the maladjusted
And there you stand
Little Lord Fauntleroy
Give it a try sometime
So shoot me now,  because no one is ever...  going to call me... Theodore again,  let alone...  Theo...  the Thumper
Wow

Nice to meet ya
Very impressive,  Ted

Sigfried
[Chuckling]  Thank God, you're okay
You bastard
[Both Gasp]  Aw, honey
lt was just a little test, and I'm glad that l did it, because now I know...  you love me f orever,  truly...  and deeply
lf the simple f act that I didn't want your bloated, dead body...  lying out on the floor is love, then no wonder we find ourselves as we are at this very moment
Oh, no
Can't be denied, can it, Ted
I think you're right,  and if you just keep this kind of open dialogue going,  I think you'll go a long way to resolving this misunderstanding
You'd be surprised what happens if people just listen...  without succumbing to all that pain and anger
You heard shit, monkey boy
Easy for you to say after you fuck another man's wif e.   [Gasps]  You should at least have the guts to stand behind...  your convictions
l swear to God
You know, when I think of all the times you were inside me...  promising me a better lif e, it makes me wanna puke
Why are you doing this to me
What have I ever done to you people
What didn't you do, stick man
No, no, no
He's got a huge cock
[Chuckles]  Oh, no, no, no, no
Show it to me
lt's not that big
[Whimpers]  Show him your cock, Theodore
[Squeaks]  Please stop talking about his cock
Well, it's hard to stop talking about something that's so huge
I mean, I could go on and on about his cock,  his bone,   his knob,  Shh

Let's get out of here
Okay
Don't break the rules and I won't break your necks
I always wanted to say that
Someone said that to me when I was a kid
The rules are simple:  Don't do anything you wouldn't do if your parents were here
lf there's an emergency, call me on the phone like your dad said
Thank you
That's not what he said
He said to call you if we need anything
Well, I have a lot of work to do, and I can't have you calling me...  every time you want a glass of water, so please,  try and limit your calls to emergencies only

Well, can't say l blame him, really
I used to hate going to sleep
Well, what my babysitter used to do to me...  to make sure I'd stay in bed, not be tempted to get up,  was she'd take some of this vapor rub ointment...   [Coughing]  [Sniff s]  and she'd dab a little on each eyelid...  just to make sure I'd stay put

Now you have some too
Don't open your eyes or it'll burn, burn, burn

Well, then get her on the phone
Tell her it's an emergency
Who Who should l say is calling
I got some major fucking emergency
Hi, Ted
I'm Margaret
You sound down
No, Margaret
This hasn't been my happiest New Year
This one's starting off pretty fucking badly
Aw, how come
You were fucked by an oven full of witches
A coven of witches
Not an oven
Well, one witch in particular
Was she an old hag with a mole on her f ace with hair growing out of it
Ted
What's the problem
Well, admittedly, that was the best part of the evening
lt was pretty bloody good actually
But it's still a pretty unnerving way to start off the night
Why don't we just skip over the witches
Skipping the witches
Right
No, he didn't make me fuck his wif e. He thought I fucked his wif e.   He held me at gunpoint with a loaded gun
What kind of gun was it
I'm not a gun guy
lt was big
Was it like Dirty Harry's gun
Yeah, sort of like that, yeah
Did it have a real long barrel or a short barrel
What diff erence does it make
44 Magnum and a Magnum
357.  Who the fuck cares whether it was a 
44 or a
392
lt was loaded
And it was pointed right at my fucking head
I want you to get Betty on the phone right fucking now
Hold on
Anybody live here named  What's her name again
Betty
Betty
Whatcha screaming about
You're Betty
Yeah, I'm Betty
Who the fuck are you
I'm Margaret
And this is Ted
You guys, wanna go to breakf ast
Let's go to Denny's
Later
Okay, Ted, what's the problem
"What's the problem?
l haven't got a problem
Plural
Wanna hear
Sure
Well, most recently, there's room 309
There's this scary Mexican gangster dude pokin' his finger in my chest
There's a putrid, rotting corpse of a dead whore stuff ed in the springs of the bed
There's rooms blazing afire
There's a big f at needle from God knows where,  stuck in my leg, inf ecting me with God knows what
Buenas noches
[Buzzing]   ls that the penthouse
[Buzzing]  Yes, it is
They want something
Well, tough titty
They're just gonna have to whistle, because I'm off
Now, Ted, wait a minute
l know you're freaked
I know you're stressed
You had a real bad night
Oh, yes, Betty
[Buzzing Continues]  The only thing I ask is that you take care of Chester Rush, and then you can leave
I don't f eel like it
Ted, he's a very important guest of the hotel
ln f act, he's the most important guest of the hotel
Through the Thirties, Forties and first half of the Fifties,  more movie stars, if you break it down on a nightbynight basis,  stayed at the Mon Signor than any other hotel in Hollywood
Now, we had some hard times in the Eighties,  even though we were the official hotel of Cannon Pictures,  but we're comin' back strong in the Nineties
And a movie star clientele is important to that comeback
You can do that, can't you
Just take care of him
The entire staff of the Mon Signor is begging you
Okay
But you get your ass down here pronto
[Buzzing Continues]   You're a good man, Ted
Thanks
[Phone Slams Onto Receiver]   Hello, Mr

Hello, Theodore

Hey, everybody
The bellboy is here

Shut up
You're makin' my friend Ted nervous
Pay no attention to Norman here
He's just That's from Quadrophenia
He's just fuckin' with you
Now me, personally, when I think of bellboy,  I think of The Bellboy with Jerry Lewis
Did you ever see that film, Ted
Oh, you should
He doesn't say a word through the entire film
lt's a completely silent perf ormance
Now how many actors can pull that off
That says it all about America right there
Just that one little sentence says it all about America right there
The minute Jerry Lewis dies, every newspaper in this fuckin' country...  is gonna be writin' articles callin' the man a genius
lt's not right
lt's not right and it's not fuckin' f air
But why should that surprise anybody
We might be right every once in awhile, but we're very rarely f air
Oh
Um... where shall I put this, sir
You in a hurry there, Ted
Uh, well, um Not particularly
Okay, then gotta stop playin' "Beat the Clock.
Okay
Let me introduce you to everybody
Now, see that girl over there
All right, that's our friend from downstairs
You seem to be acquainted
Actually, the name's Ted, Angela
I only let people with loaded guns pointed at my head call me Theodore
The man sittin' in this chair with the Jim Beam in his hand,  yellin' "Bellboy" at you is Norman
Norman, say hello to Ted
[Blowing Party Favor]   What's up, Ted

Um, ff ar be it Far be it for me, uh, Chester  Uhhuh

And... a hatchet

Let's go
Pronto, man
You heard him, Ted
Go ahead
Right you are, sir
Yeah
Yes, it's my fucking job
You know that
I can't l went to the Monkey Bar, all right
[Chester, Norman, lndistinct]  [Leo] Don't yell I'm not yelling
Hey
You're the one that's fuckin' yellin'
Fuck Don't hang up on me
Ellen, please don't hang up on me
Please don't hang up on me
Goddamn it
Fuckin' call better be genuine, 'cause I'm gonna get a divorce
[Norman] Yo, Leo

You're still married, man
I don't fucking know anymore
I swear to Christ, Norman

You know that, man
So I had a little fuckin' too much to drink
lt's fuckin' New Year's Eve
New Year's Eve
I can't fuckin' drive home
Okay, Ellen, I'm sorry
I'm fuckin' sorry about that
What do you want me to do
That'd be real fuckin' nice
[Sighs]  Fuck
What the fuck is all this
Block of wood, bucket of ice and a hatchet, sir
Get the fuck outta here
Chester, talk to me
Norman
Oh, my fucking dick is hard already
Tell me, Norman, you're gonna do this shit
[Norman Laughing]   [Norman] I am gonna do it
Oh, you are my fuckin' hero
They better, after talkin' about it all night
I wanna see a show
Give me your motherfuckin'  All right then
Well, if that's everything
[Leo] I got Cedars lined up, man
I got a doctor waitin' in the fuckin' emergency
Just in case
Hey, just in fucking case
I'll just be off back downstairs, sir
Not so f ast
Fuckin' treat that bitch like a queen, man
We're gonna walk back...   to this little bar here
I told you to dump her, didn't l
Leo
Sit on this little red stool
All right
Um, sir
Uhhuh
A word in your ear, sir
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure
Excusezmoi
I treat that bitch like a queen, man
I'm fuckin' working
As long as you don't break up the furniture,  I don't give a fuck what you do
Took all your money
Gonna take your kids and house
As f ar as I'm concerned,  go ahead, trash the place
Oh, but, look, let me explain what we're talkin' about
Sir, sir, you don't have to explain anything to me
Well, no, it's your business too, Ted, because we want you to take part
[Tooting]  Take part in what, sir
Think so
Just spit it out
Okay, okay, here we go
Okay
Thing is, Ted, first off,  there's nothing homosexual about what we want you to do
Nothing, nothing could be further from the truth
Can I just jump in here for a second
No
My kind of way of telling him is kind of going all around the world
But it's the journey that's worth it
Yeah, well, I see that
Why don't you just shut the fuck up, bitch
"Bitch"
Bitch
Uh, excuse me, aren't you the one who's being paid to suck his cock, cork boy
Cork boy, man
Business card
I see a new business card
[Spoon Tapping Glass]  Excuse me, if it please the court
I second the nomination
I move that nomination be closed
Thank you
The court is yours, Leo
Thank you very much, Chester
Ted, you ever seen any of them old Alfred Hitchcock episodes
Yes, sir
You ever see the one called The Man From Rio with Peter Lorre and Steve McQueen
lt's called The Man From Rio with Peter Lorre, Steve McQueen
Now, if Steve McQueen lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a row,  he wins Peter Lorre's new car
But if he does not light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row,  Peter Lorre gets to chop off Steve McQueen's little pinky
Norman and Chester here just made that same bet
Norman has bet his pinky...  that he can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row
lf he does,  he wins Chester's 1964 Chevy Chevelle...  red, fuckin', beautiful car
lf he doesn't, chop off his fuckin' pinky
What do you say
Yes
Of course
Teddy, that's why we're here, but that does not mean...  that we don't know what the fuck we're talking about
I'm gonna tell you what the fuck I'm talkin' about
I'm gonna tell you what the fuck I'm talkin' about
I drive a motherfucking Honda that my sister sold me
You hear what I'm saying
You see this shit
next to America's hottest old car
That's the car I own
Are you listenin' to me
Are you
Goddamn shit
Now you take a good long look at that there machine...  that this motherfucker over here's standin' next to
That's a 1964 niggerred, ragtop Chevy Chevelle
And I love that car more than l love hips, lips or fingertips
When you're drinking champagne, you're drinking champagne
When you're drinking Cristal, you say you're drinking Cristal
Whatever that pissityass thing is, we are drinking it, you know
And we are watching TV
[Murmurs]  What, what
Hey, hey, hey
When all of a sudden,  we flip on Steve McQueen, Peter Lorre being fuckin' badasses
Badass
And I look over at this funnylooking motherfucker over here,  and I say, "I'd do that f or the Chevelle.
I'm funny
And that's when Chester says  "Oh, really?
We already told you we were drunk, Ted
That goes without motherfucking saying
'Cause if we wasn't drunk, we'd probably chicken out
Man, you tell the fuckin' truth
You want to know what the fuckin' truth is
The fuckin' truth is, my lucky Zippo is gonna win me...  Chester's fucking car
Which brings us to your part in this little wager, Ted
I don't have a part, sir
That's it
That's quite brilliant, sir
Thing is, there are some inherent obstacles in this undertaking
Aside from the obvious
First of which is being the f act that I'm not like Peter Lorre on that TV show
I'm not some sick fuck travelin' the countryside collecting fingers
All right, you know, we're all buddies here
We just want to chop it off
You know, if f ate doesn't smile on old Norman,  we'll put that fucker on ice, whisk it right to the hospital,  where in all likelihood they'll be able to sew it right back on
Yeah, well, they sewed that guy's dick back on
They can sew Norman's pinky back on
Yeah, how hard can it be
Yeah, good point
So, Norman, he's, he's taken care of, you know
My interests, on the other hand, have not
I am as emotionally attached to my car as Norman is physically to his finger
That's a very fuckin' piece of expensive machinery I'm putting on this wager
That's fine
That's no problem
I have no problem with that
I'm a big boy
But if I win, l wanna win
All right
lf Norman lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a fuckin' row,  he's gonna have no emotional problems whatsoever about taking my car keys
[Murmurs]  But if I win,  well, it's not inconceivable that at the last minute...  maybe neither Leo or l...  will be able to... wield the axe
A hatchet, sir
Which brings us full circle to you, Ted
[Glass Clatters On Bar]  Cleareyed Ted
Sober Ted
Completestranger Ted
lmpartial Ted
Justmetusandcouldn't giveafuckaboutus Ted
Hell of a night, huh, Ted
Money
Ted, I got a $100 bill here with your name on it,  whether you do what we ask or not
Just to sit back down in that chair for one minute more
I am not gonna cut off Norman's little pinky
But that has nothin' to do with this $100 bill in my hand
ln f act, you can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that goddamn door
But if you wait 60 seconds bef ore you do it,  you're gonna be $100 richer
Ted, you're gonna do whatever you wanna do
All we're askin' is that you indulge us for one minute more
Ted, take the money
Now, let me get this straight
I sit on that stool, listen to what you have to say for 60 seconds,   and I get $100
[Chester] Correct
And afterwards I can walk out that door, no hard f eelings
You got a deal
Yes
Oh, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes,
Ted, good answer
All right
Norman, give me your watch
Let me know when a minute ends and when it begins
You got it
Ah
Okay
Gentlemen, start your engines
Okay, Ted, pay attention here
I'm gonna make two piles here on the bar
One pile which is yours
And another pile which could be yours
And what you have to realize is we're gonna do this thing...  one way or the other
You can buy a whole lot of soup with that pile
Shh
I'm the closer here
I'm a little me Um, I've lost count
How much is on the bar here
[Group] Six hundred
Ted, do you know how long it takes the average American to count to 600
[Angela] lt's a rhetorical question, Ted
No, sir
About one minute less than it takes to count to 700
Now, Ted, a person's lif e is filled with a zillion little experiences
Some which are insignificant, have no meaning, and, you know, you f orget them
So, since you're gonna be stuck remembering this f or the rest of your lif e,  you have to decide what that memory will be
So, Ted, are you going to remember for the next 40 years,  give or take a decade,  that you refused $1,000 f or one second's worth of work
Or that you made $1,000 f or one second's worth of work
So, Ted, what's it gonna be
Okay
[Group] Yes
Always be closing
Whoo
Right here, right now
Hear, hear
Go
Let's go
Get this shit over and done with
This is one of those moments in time...  none of us are ever gonna f orget
Norman, are you ready
I'm ready
Ted, are you ready
Okeydokey
Norman...  begin
Aaah
My fuckin' finger
He cut off my fuckin' finger
Oh
lt hurts
Nonsense Syllables]  My fuckin' finger, Chester
He cut off my fuckin' finger
Oh, Leo
Call fuckin' Cedars
Wrap it up
Could I talk to Don Levine, please
do this
Why'd you let me do this
he's in surgery
He was supposed to be there
What
Who the fuck has plastic surgery at 6:30 in the morning on New Year's Eve
Nonsense Syllables]   Leo
I need you to stand still
I'll be right back
Hold it
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
All right
Leo
[Elevator Bell Dings]  I f orgot the finger
l gotta get the  lt's the finger
I got the finger
l got it
right here
Come on, come on
The fuckin' door's closin'
Here
Just put some fuckin' ice in it
All right, let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Get up, get up
I'm gonna go back to my room
Are you comin' or not
No, it's been fun
[Group] Oh
Close the fuckin' door
Nonsense Syllables]  Nonsense Syllables]  Nonsense Syllables]      While I'm very familiar with you and your family,  I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am
Are you aware of my existence
This is good
Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France
Yes
Please tell me what you've heard
I've heard  that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France  who are either hiding or passing for Gentile
But the meaning of your visit,  pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews  and found nothing
I'm aware of that
But like any enterprise, when under new management,  there is always a slight duplication of efforts,  most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless
I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite
If you can assist me with answers,  my department can close the file on your family
Now,  before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area,  all dairy farmers like yourself
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts  and the Dreyfuses
Is that correct
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe
this is your house, make yourself comfortable
Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape  or someone is very successfully hiding them
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite
Only rumors
I love rumors
Facts could be so misleading,  where rumors, true or false, are often revealing
Again, this is just a rumor,  but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain
So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape
Yes
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me  the exact members of the household and their names
The father, Jacob
Wife, Miram
And her brother, Bob
How old is Bob
Continue
And the children,  Amos  and Shosanna
Ages of the children
Amos was nine or 10
And Shosanna
And Shosanna was  18 or 19
Well, I guess that should do it
However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk
But of course
I have no interest in such things
But you are aware of what they call me
What are you aware of
That they call you "The Jew Hunter.
Precisely
I understand your trepidation in repeating it
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker  the good people of Prague have bestowed on him
lt would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it
Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title  precisely because I've earned it
precisely, a German soldier
Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast,  it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk
But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast,  it would be that of the rat
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing
But where our conclusions differ,  is I don't consider the comparison an insult
Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in
It's a hostile world, indeed
I suppose I would
Rats spread disease
They bite people
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago
I propose to you any disease a rat could spread,  a squirrel could equally carry
Would you agree
No
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not
And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they
However interesting as the thought may be,  it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel
If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking  would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk
Probably not
I didn't think so
You don't like them
You don't really know why you don't like them
All you know is you find them repulsive
Where does the hawk look
But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide
However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria  and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of  once they abandon dignity
May I smoke my pipe as well
Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home
Now, my job dictates  that I must have my men enter your home  and conduct a thorough search  before I can officially cross your family's name off my list
And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be
I might add, also, that any information  that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment
Actually, quite the contrary
And that reward will be,  your family will cease to be harassed in any way  by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country
You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not
Yes
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you
Yes
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,  I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade
ls that clear
It's the girl
Au revoir, Shosanna
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine
And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers
Eight Jewish American soldiers
Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon
Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier
We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians
Killing Nazis
I don't know about you all,  but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains,  cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily  and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity
Nazi ain't got no humanity
They're the foot soldiers of a Jewhating, massmurdering maniac  and they need to be destroyed
That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform,  they're going to die
That means I got a little lndian in me
And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance
We will be cruel to the Germans
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty  in the disemboweled, dismembered  and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us
And the German won't be able to help themselves  but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands,  and our boot heels and the edge of our knives
And the German will be sickened by us
And the German will talk about us
And when the German closes their eyes at night  and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done,  it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with
Sound good
ALL: Yes, sir
That's what I like to hear
But I got a word of warning for all you wouldbe warriors
When you join my command, you take on debit
Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps
And I want my scalps
Or you will die trying
Hey, Hirschberg
Send that Kraut sarge over
HIRSCHBERG: You
Go
Sergeant Werner Rachtman
Pleased to meet you
You know what "sit down" means, Werner
Yes
How is your English, Werner
Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate
Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for
Another one up there you might be familiar with
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz
Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz
MALE NARRATOR: The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity  among German soldiers is simple
As a Germanenlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers
Instead of putting him up against a wall,  the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin  to be made an example of
Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him,  he never got there
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz
These are the Basterds
Ever heard of us
We just want to say we're a big fan of your work
I think you show great talent
And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent
But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur
Can I assume you know who we are
You're Aldo the Apache
Werner, if you heard of us,  you probably heard we ain't in the prisonertaking business
We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is abooming
HIRSCHBERG: [ LAUGHING ] Oh, yeah
Either kill you or let you go
Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive  depends entirely on you
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard
Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere
If that patrol were to have any crack shots,  that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight
You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me  what kind of artillery they're carrying with them
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect
And you need to tell me
And you need to tell me right now
Now, just take that finger of yours  and point out on this here map where this party is being held,  how many is coming and what they brought to play with
I respectfully refuse, sir
Hear that
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz
You might know him better by his nickname
The Bear Jew
I heard of The Bear Jew
What did you hear
Beats German soldiers with a club
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does
He's going to take that big bat of his,  and he's going to beat your ass to death with it
Now, take your Wienerschnitzellicking finger,  and point out on this map what I want to know
Fuck you
And your Jew dogs
Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death  is the closest we ever get to going to the movies
Donny
DONNY: Yeah
Oblige him
Did you get that for killing Jews
Bravery
Yeah
BASTERD 1: Oh, no
BASTERD 2: Oh, no
BASTERD: Yeah, Donny
About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you
Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park
He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street
You
Damn it, Hirschberg
Alive
Get the fuck up
Batter up
You're on deck
Two hits
I hit you, you hit the ground
ALDO: Wicki
Ask him if he wants to live
Tell him to point out on this map the German position
Ask him how many Germans
Around about 12
Now, when you report what happened here,  you can't tell them you told us what you told us
They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live
So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks  what's going to happen to every Nazi we find
Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do
WlCKl: He's going to hug his mother
Well, ain't that nice
Ask if he's going to take off his uniform
WICKI: He's going to burn it
We don't like that
See, we like our Nazis in uniforms
That way you can spot them
Just like that
And that don't sit well with us
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you
Practice
HANS: Au revoir, Shosanna
MALE NARRATOR: At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable  that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar
Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle
Yes
Then they're flammable
Go on, hop off
MALE NARRATOR: Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper
Shosanna has a collection  of over 350 nitrate film prints
Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir
At ease, Hicox
Drink
If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water
Thataboy, Lieutenant
Make it yourself like a good chap, will you
Something for yourself, sir
Whiskey
Straight
lt says here that you speak German fluently
Like a Katzenjammer Kid
And your occupation before the war
I'm a film critic
List your accomplishments
Well, sir, such as they are,  I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers,  and I've had two books published
Impressive
What are their titles
The first book was called  Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema in the '20s
And the second one was called TwentyFour Frame da Vinci
It's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W
Pabst
Well...  Down with Hitler
All the way down, sir
Yes
Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich
Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years,  but I'm familiar with it
Pardon, sir
Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry  under the Third Reich
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels
Goebbels considers the films he's making  to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema
How's he doing
Frightfully sorry, sir
Once again
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,  how's he doing
Since Goebbels has taken over,  film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number
Brief him
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino
Three days from now  Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris
What film, sir
The motion picture is called Nation's Pride
In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion  will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command  including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo,  as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry
Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket
The objective of Operation Kino,  blow up the basket
Jolly good, sir
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines  will be your assist
The Germans call them the Basterds
The Basterds
Never heard of them
Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them
You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris
The Basterds will be waiting for you
First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine
In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane
There you'll rendezvous with our double agent
She'll take it from there
She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need
How will I know her
I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark
Bridget von Hammersmark
Yes, for the last two years now
One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild
Indeed
Got the gist
I think so, sir
Paris when it sizzles
l didn't know
lt is a tavern
Yeah, in a basement
You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties
Number one being, you're fighting in a basement
What if we go in there and she's not even there
We wait
Don't worry
She'll make the rendezvous
Stiglitz, right
That's right, sir
l hear you're pretty good with that
Simply making contact with our agent
Should be uneventful
However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,  I need to know we can all remain calm
Well, now that you put it like that, l guess you do
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he
ls that the kind of man you need
Loquacious type
So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do
Make bets on how it all comes out
If we get into trouble, we can handle it
But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure  no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous
She chose the spot
Isn't that just dandy
Look, she's not a military strategist
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement
She wasn't picking a place to fight
Mmm
HlCOX SPEAKING GERMAN ]               Well, if this is it, old boy,  l hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's
By all means, Captain
There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch
Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,  l must say, damn good stuff, sir
Now, about this pickle  we find ourselves in
And what would that be
Stiglitz
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls
You outside
Who are you
American
What
ALDO: We're American
What are you
I'm a German, you idiot
l agree
So let's talk
Okay, talk
My baby was born today
ln Frankfurt
Five hours ago
H is name is Max
We were in here drinking, celebrating
It's not my fault
Okay
lt wasn't your fault
What's your name, soldier
Now, is there anybody alive on our side
No
I'm alive
ls the girl on your side
Which girl
Von Hammersmark
Yeah, she's ours
ls she okay
She's been shot
But she's alive
ALDO: Okay, Wilhelm
What do you say we make us a deal
What's your name
Aldo
You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away
No guns
And we take the girl and leave
It's that simple, Willi
You go your way, we go ours
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy
We got us a deal
Aldo
I'm here, Willi
l want to trust you
But..
But how can l
Okay, okay
Aldo,  I'm going to trust you
Come down
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun
l thought we had us a deal
We still have a deal
Not so fast
We only got a deal, we trust each other
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust
You got guns on us
You decide to shoot, we're dead
Up top, they got grenades
They drop them down here, you're dead
No trust, no deal
Fine
Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight
Not so goddamn fast, doc
Tell him to go play with his dogs
Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions
Few questions about what
About I got three men dead back there
Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened
Before we get into who shot John,  why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis
l can see since you didn't see what happened inside,  that the Nazis being there must look odd
Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English
Everybody needs to calm down
You're letting your imagination get the better of you
You met the sergeant yourself
Willi
You remember him, don't you
His wife had a baby tonight
He had just become a..
He had just become a father
The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence
It couldn't be both
The Englishman gave himself away
How'd he do that
He ordered three glasses
We order three glasses
That's the German three
The other looks odd
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans  and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to
What was the next step
To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms  with all the military there would've been suicide
But going as members of the German film industry,  they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else
I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight
Hand me my purse
Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant
You still get us in that premiere
You speak German better than your friends
Have I been shot
Yes
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon
However, there's something you don't know
There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino
One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue
Enormous change at the last minute
That's not very Germatic
Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar
It probably has something to do with the second development
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere
Fuck a duck
What are you thinking
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf  makes this horse a different color
lt means you getting us in that premiere
Byebye, acting career
Fun while it lasted
How do you expect me to walk the red carpet
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam
That's German, ain't it
You all like climbing mountains, don't you
I don't
I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants
But I see your point
We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears  and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet
I know this is a silly question before I ask it,  but can you Americans speak any other language than English
With an atrocious accent, no doubt
But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib
Germans don't have a good ear for ltalian
So you mumble ltalian and brazen through it
That's about it
That sounds good
It sounds like shit
Go home
No, that sounds good
If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building
Who does what
Well, I speak the most ltalian, so I'll be your escort
Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman
He'll be Donny's assistant
Like I said, third best
Just keep your fucking mouth shut
In fact, why don't you start practicing right now
Yes
Gorlomi
Gorlomi
Antonio Margheriti
Dominick Decocco
ANNOUNCING IN GERMAN ]     What's that American expression
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it.
ALDO: Fucking shithead
Faggot fuck
Fuck you
Fuck you, too
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches
Get your hands off me
You fucking bratwurstsmelling... Goddamn you
Hmm
You Jerrybanging, Limburgsmelling...   As Stanley said to Livingstone,  Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume
Hans Landa
You've had a nice long run, Aldo
My hands to be exact
And they've been waiting a long time to touch you
Caught you flinching
Utivich
Is that you, Lieutenant
Yeah
Do you know what happened to Donny
The woman
No, I do not
Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting,  would you show me mercy
Nope
"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot.
Yeah, I was just thinking that
So you're Aldo the Apache
So you're The Jew Hunter
I'm a detective
A damn good detective
And, yes, some of them were Jews
But Jew Hunter
Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy
Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man
What do you mean the Little Man
The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man
And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life
l mean, you're a little fellow, but not circusmidget little,  as your reputation would suggest
Where's my men
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark
And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark,  you get what you pay for
Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...  How you know our names
Lieutenant Aldo,  if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate  every single one of your swastikamarked survivors,  we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed
Well, back to the whereabouts of your two ltalian saboteurs
As of this moment,  both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in
Doublezero 23 and doublezero 24, if my memory serves
Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode
And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot,  as of this moment, is still a go
What's next
Eliza on lce
However,  all I have to do is pick up this phone right here,  inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput
If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if,  there ain't no way you're going to take them boys  without setting off them bombs
And, yes, some Germans will die
Yes, it will ruin the evening
And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you  for what you've done to his big night
But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels,  you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann
And you need all four to end the war
And if you get all four, you end the war  tonight
So, gentlemen,  let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight
Wouldn't you agree
I guess so
How about you, Utivich
I guess so, too
Gentlemen, l have no intention  of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann,  not to mention winning the war singlehandedly for the Allies,  only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal
If you want to win the war tonight,  we have to make a deal
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make
However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer
I'm betting for...  OSS would be my guess
That's a bingo
Is that the way you say it
"That's a bingo.
You just say, "Bingo.
Bingo
But I digress
Where were we
Yeah
Make a deal
Get me someone on the other end of that radio  with the power of the pen to authorize my,  let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender
If that tastes better going down
Where is that exactly
Maynardville, Tennessee
I've done my share of bootlegging
Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true,  it ain't
Sitting in your chair, l would probably say the same thing,  and 999
999 times out of a million, you would be correct
But in the pages of history, every once in a while,  fate reaches out and extends its hand
What shall the history books read
MAN: I implore you
We must destroy that tower
Sarge, that tower...  MAN: The tower stands
Psst
HANS: So when the military history of this night is written,  it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino  from the very beginning as a double agent
Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel  was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil  to establish my cover with the Germans
By the way, that last part is actually true
I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank
In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino  to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor
Full citizenship for myself
Well, that goes without saying
Do you have all that, sir
l look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir
Lieutenant Raine
Right here
Yes, sir
GENERAL: Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners
Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines
You will then take over driving of the truck  and bring them straight to me for debriefing
ls that clear, Lieutenant
Over and out
When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard
Can you do it
I have to
Who wants to send a message to Germany
I have a message for Germany
That you are all going to die
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it
Marcel, burn it down
Oui, Shosanna
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus,  and this is the face  of Jewish vengeance
I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine
We're your prisoners
How about my knife
Thank you very much, Colonel
ls that really necessary
I'm a slave to appearances
Scalp Hermann
Are you mad
I made a deal with your general for that man's life
Yeah, they made that deal
But they don't give a fuck about him
They need you
Nah, I don't think so
I've been chewed out before
You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass
End the war tonight
I'd make that deal
How about you, Utivich
You make that deal
I don't blame you
Damn good deal
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself
Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,  l suppose that's worth certain considerations
But I do have one question
Ain't you
Now, that I can't abide
How about you, Utivich, can you abide it
Not one damn bit, sir
l mean, if I had my way,  you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your peckersucking life
I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off
So,  I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off
You know something, Utivich

That there is a TEC9

And they ain't want one, they want two,  'cause all them niggers want to be the killer
Now, I try to steer my customers toward a 9 millimeter...  'cause it's damn near the same weapon and it ain't got half the jammin' problems
But you know how them niggers is out there
You can't tell 'em shit
They want a.45
The killer had a .45, they want a .45
Mmhmm
Who's your partner?
Cat named Mr. Walker
Runs a fishing boat out of Mexico
I get the merchandise to him, he gets it out to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway
Before I set that nigger up, he didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of
Got hisself a yacht with all kind of hightech navigational shit on it
AK47, the very best there is
When you absolutely, positively got to kill every motherfucker in the room,  accept no substitutes
Nothing gets between me and my AK
I get 'em for 850 and double my money

1436 Florence Boulevard,  Compton, 90222

That's a house
It's your benefactor, nigger

It's open
My pleasure of living...  demands that I have a goodlooking woman, that I'm with a goodlooking woman
I couldn't go out with a woman old enough to be my wife
O.D.!
Ahhaha
What's up, man?
Come here, boy
I didn't know you were coming by
Yeah
My nigger
Good lookin' out, man
I don't know what to say
Thank you, thank you
Who was there for your ass, huh?
You was there
Who?
Who?
You
You, nigger
You
See?
You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out
That's my motherfucking job
And I don't mind telling you, nigger, it's steady work
Hey, look here, man, I'm still scared as a motherfucker, O.D
They talkin' like they serious as hell...  givin' me time for that machine gun shit
Oh, come on, man
They're just trying to put a fright in your ass
How old is that machine gun shit, huh?
About three years
Three years?
Come on, man, that's a old crime, man
How they gonna find room for you?
That ain't what they're telling me
That's why they call it "fuckin' with you.
Now, let me tell you how we're going to retaliate
All right?
Let me tell you something about my lawyer
This nigger is a junkyard dog
He my own personal Johnny Cochran
Matter of fact, he kicked Johnny Cochran's ass
And like Johnny Cochran, this nigger hate cops
He live to fuck with the police
Now, as a favor, I had him look at your case
He say you ain't got shit to worry about
They just fuckin' with you
So we're gonna sic the junkyard dog on their ass and make 'em stop fuckin' with you
Good lookin' out, man
Good lookin' out
Mmhmm
Come on in, man, and let's celebrate
Uhuh
Look here, I'm really supposed to be somewhere
Matter of fact, I was kind of hoping you could come run with me
What you mean?
What?
What you want?
I need a favor, nigger
That requires me to go out tonight?
Just a bit
It is late as hell, man
I'm home, I'm high, man
Uhhuh
And why are you home, huh?
You home because I spent $10,000 to get your ass home
Now, look, I got a little problem, all right?
I need some help, and you can help me out
Go in the house and throw some shit on
Come on
I'm ready, man
There ain't no problem
It's more like a situation
You remember them three M60 machine guns I sold last year outta the five I got?
Well, I'm gonna sell the other two tonight
There's this group of Koreans over in Korea town startin' this little Neighborhood Watch thing
They need some weapons so they can show the neighborhood niggers they mean business
Now, I'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
The problem is, I ain't never done business with these Koreans before
I ain't worried, 'cause by and large Asians are very dependable
You might argue with them about price and shit,  but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back
But I got me a rule
Never do business with people you ain't never done business with before without backup
Backup
Look, all you've got to do is lay in here and hold on to this motherfucker
All right?
When I open the trunk, you pop up and rack this motherfucker
Man, fuck that shit
I ain't for shootin' nobody
I ain't said nothin' about you shootin' nobody
All you gotta do is hold on to it
They'll get the idea
You must be out of your mind if you think I'm gonna get in this dirtyass trunk
You ain't gonna be in here no more than ten minutes
Why can't I ride up front with you?
You can't ride up front with me
The surprise element is 90% of it
I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gettin' in no goddamn trunk
I can't believe you'd do me like this
I just ain't climbing in no goddamn, dirtyass trunk, man
I got a problem with small places
I got a problem with spending $10,000 on ungrateful niggers to get them out of jail,  but I did it
I know I owe you, you got to bring all this up
Then get your ass in this trunk
I want to help you, but I won't be locked in no goddamn trunk of no car
You think I wanted to spend $10,000 on your ass, huh?
I know you helped me out
Do you think I wanted to spend $10,000 on your ass?
Yes or no?
That's the only way I could help you, right?
So that's what I did
Now, look, man, all I'm asking you to do is get in the trunk,  hold this fuckin' shotgun, point it at these Buddhaheads when I open it, all right?
You're catching a nigger offguard with this shit
Look here
When we get through fucking with these Koreans,  me and you go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles on me
Think about it now
That's some good eatin'
Man
Exactly how long do I gotta be in this motherfucker?
Hey, motherfucker, you like to hit my goddamn head
You pony tailwearing motherfucker

I'm in the cozy confines of an Oldsmobile...  parked right outside Simone's house
Yeah
Come on in
I already caught that show
I got some foryoureyesonly shit to show you
Why don't you step outside?
Who was that?
Who's Beaumont?
A employee I had to let go
He put hisself in a position where he was gonna have to do ten years in prison
That's what he did
And if you know Beaumont,  you know there ain't no goddamn way he can do ten years
If you know that, then you know Beaumont's gonna do anything Beaumont can...  to keep from doin' them ten years,  includin' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing...  about my black ass
Now, that, my friend, is a clearcut case...  of him or me,  and you best believe...  it ain't gonna be me
Now, Louis,  if you gonna come in on this thing with me,  you've got to be prepared...  to go all the way
I make this delivery,  I'm gonna have me over a million
Hey, you think I'm gonna let a little cheeseeatin' nigger like this fuck that up?
You best think again
You understand what I'm saying?
Yeah
Sowe on the same page then?
Yeah, I follow
Miss Brown
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargas, L.A.P.D
Can I ask what you have in that bag?
The usual stuff
You know, I'm a flight attendant for Cabo Air
Who's this?
Sorry, this is Special Agent Ray Nicollet with Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
Oh, yeah?
May I see some I.D.?
Sure
Would you mind if we just took a look in that bag?
Do I mind?
Do I have a choice?
You have the right to say no
No
I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant
If I don't want to go to all that trouble, I'd just take you in on suspicion now
Suspicion of what?
Uh, could I say something?
Go ahead
Thanks a lot
Bad knees
You have a good flight?
It's a shitty flight down to Cabo
Fuckin' turbulence was unbelievable
Hey, can I look in this envelope?
Ah
Goddamn
I'd say there's about, oh, uh,  $50,000 here
Looks like about 50,000 from here
Is this your money?
You should know if you bring in anything over 1 0,000, you have to declare it
You forget, or what?
You can get a $250,000 fine, plus two years in prison
You want to talk to us about this, or do you want to talk to Customs?
I'm not sayin' another word
Jackie  I hope you don't mind if I call you Jackie
They're a bunch of pricks
Excuse me, but they are
There's something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with
You can go down and talk with those guys...  who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings,  or you can talk with a couple of goodhearted guys like Mark and myself
at the file on Jacqueline Brown
According to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law
In 1985, while a stewardess for Delta,  you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot
That pilot was my husband, and I got off
He did time, you did probation
I didn't hear you ask permission to smoke in my office
May I smoke?
No, you may not
So you get off with a slap on the wrist,  but all this criminal activity fucks up your shit for good with the big airlines
Cut to 1 3 years later, you're 44 years of age,  flying for the shittiest little shuttlefuckin 'piece of shit Mexican airline there is,  where you make what $ 1 3, 000 a year
Didn't exactly set the world on fire, did you, Jackie?
Jackie, you have a good lawyer?
a good one, is more like it
Otherwise you'll be in Sybil Brand three weeks...  before the public defender gets around to ya
Hey, Jackie, do you know a guy named Beaumont Livingston?
Yeah?
No?
Because he knows you
He doesn't know anybody now
He's dead
They found him in a trunk of a car this morning,  shot twice
Once in the chest, once in the head
So I guess I'm wondering
If you don't know Beaumont,  why do you suppose Beaumont knows you?
we don't give a fuck about you
If you cooperate, tell us what we want to know, we'll help you get out of this
If you refuse to cooperate, continue to cop a shit attitude like you're doing now,  we will give you to Customs and they will take you to court
Now, you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change,  but if I was a 44yearold black woman...  desperately clinging on to this one shitty, little job I was fortunate enough to get,  I don't think that I'd think I had a year to throw away
So let's start again now, shall we
Who in Mexico gave you this money, and who in America were you bringing it to
I 'm not sayin' another goddamn word
I 'd like your permission to look through this again so we'll know how much we're talking about
Sure
While we're at it, let's see what else is in there
Do you mind
Beauty case
What's in it
Beauty products
Alarm clock
Glass case
Birth control
My diet shit
Let's see what else is in there

The charge is...  possession of narcotics with the intent to distribute
How does your client plead?
Uh, Your Honor, she wishes to stand mute
Detective... Varga
Dargas, Your Honor
Sorry
That's correct, Your Honor
And do you have a bail recommendation
Yes, I do, Your Honor
Based on the defendant's prior conviction...  and the extreme possibility of flight due to the occupation,  the state requests a bond of no less than 25,000
You people are fine with this
I'm gonna set bond at 1 0,000...  and set the date of August 2 1...  for the prelim
Your Honor, when will that be?
That's six weeks from now
We'll continue this matter then
The charge is possession of a concealed weapon...  and striking an officer
How does your client plead
I thought it'd be 2 5.  would like to plead guilty, Your Honor
here in the courtroom
I didn't hear you wash your hands
Comfortable?
Door was open, so I just come on in
I can see that
Why?
Got some more business for you
Oh, yeah?
What did he do?
She is an airline stewardess
Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow
Now, I'm figuring you could take that $1 0,000 you owe me from Beaumont,  move it over to the stewardess
The bond for possession's only a thousand
Hmm
Yeah
They callin' that shit "possession with intent.
A 44yearold black woman caught with less than two ounces,  they calling that shit "intent.
The same thing happen to a movie star, they call it "possession.
Still sounds high
All right, before we start talking about stewardesses,  Let's get Beaumont out of the way first
What?
You ain't hear?
Hear what?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out
Oh, shit
Blew Beaumont's brains out
Police make contact with you?
First motherfucking thing they did
You know, they see I pay a big money bond for my boy,  they start thinking that "where there's smoke there's fire" logic
Rousted my ass out of bed 1 0:.00 in the morning
Scared the shit out of my woman Sheronda
She thought they was gonna take my ass away for sure
Mmhmm
Brown
Jackie Brown
What does she do for you?
Who said she do anything for me?
She's my friend
Beaumont worked for you
You can't tell nothing I say to you?
You're not my client till you get busted and I bond you out
Well, we ain't got no, uh What you call that shit?
Confidentiality
Why should I tell you anything?
'Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are
And why would a stewardess be bringing me 50 grand?
Now you want me to speculate on what you do
I'd say you were in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction
Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so, uh, more power to you
All right
You want another bond?
That means paperwork
I gotta get a death certificate, present it to the court,  make out a receipt for return of bond collateral, I type up another application,   Hey, hey, hey, hey
I haven't got time
I'm telling you what I have to do
What you have to do, in case you forgot,   is come up with a premium of a thousand bucks
You know I got the money
I just ain't got it with me
Come back when you do
I'll bond out the stewardess
Look, you got to look at this with a little compassion, all right?
She ain't used to this kind of treatment
Gangsters don't give a fuck, but your average citizen,  a couple of nights in County get to fuckin' with their mind
Ordell, this isn't a bar
You don't have a tab
Listen to me, all right?
She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Falsely accused of "intent.
If she had that shit and mind you, I'm saying if  that was her own personal shit to get high with
Oh, it's like that, huh?

I figure about 80% oft hose were drugrelated, so...  if you want, I could help you figure out your options
So far, they told me if I cooperate,  then I'll get probation, maybe
Does that sound right?
I'd say that if they try you and convict you, you won't get more than a year and a day
That's state time, prison
But they won't want to do that
Do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag?
Yeah
But that's not what this is about
They knew about the money
They even knew the exact amount
Who gave me the money and who I was givin' it to
They found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off
They said it was him who told them about me
That would be... Beaumont Livingston
How do you know about him?
I wrote him on Monday

I bet that was that present Mr. Walker was sending Melanie
Yeah
If you didn't put it in there, he must have
Damn
Baby, I'm sorry
Bet they asked you a whole shit load of questions about it, huh?
And all that money, where it came from
Probably asked you who you was bringing' it to too
And you said?
"I want to talk to my lawyer.
You sure you didn't get nervous and kind of let somethin' slip?
I mean, if you did, I ain't mad at you
You ain't asking the right questions
You should be asking why they picked me up
They were waiting for me
They knew about the money and they knew the exact amount
Hmm
I knew it
I knew it
They even asked me if I knew Mr. Walker
Yeah?
I didn't tell them anything about him
Mmmm
You ain't said nothin' about me
Mmmm
Ah, that's mighty noble of you
They tell you what happened to this Beaumont fellow
Yeah, they told me
Somebody must have been real mad at old Beaumont
Yeah, I bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions
And you ain't givin' them no kind of answer
Mmmm
You scared of me
You got any reason to be nervous around me
Is that what I think it is?
I think it's a gun pressed up against my dick
Well, you thought right
Now, take your hands from around my throat,  nigger
Shut the fuck up
Don't you move
Oh, what is this
What the fuck is this
I carry that all the time
You been talking to them police too much
The police didn't try and strangle my ass
I was just playing with you
I ain't playing with you
I'm gonna unload both of these motherfuckers if you don't do what I tell you to do
You understand what I'm saying
Do you understand what the fuck I'm saying
Yeah, woman
Damn
Now, sit your ass down on that sofa
See
Police start fuckin' with your mind, start pittin' black against black
That's how they do
Sit the fuck down
And put your hands behind your head
Oh, silly?
You want to see some motherfuckin' silly
If I have to tell you to shut up one more time, I'm gonna shut you up
I just came over here to talk to you
To talk?
The way I see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about
I can get you a lawyer
No, let's be realistic
Now, sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal,  and you know that
That's why you came here to kill me
I ain't come over to kill you
It's okay
Now, I forgive you
Now, let's say, if I tell on you,  I walk
If I don't, I'll go to jail
I want $100,000...  in an escrow account in my name...  if I'm convicted up to a year or put on probation
Now, if I have to do more than a year,  you pay another $100,000
I can do that
You know I got that problem
Well, I been thinking about that too
I got me an idea
Uh  Let me hear that
We friends again
Why don't you point that motherfucking gun somewhere else
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on
All right
Come in and I'll get it for you
Max, look, I am so sorry about this

I mean, you'd have to
Would you like some coffee
I am
Come on in
Why don't you make yourself at home
Did you get a chance to use it?
I felt a lot safer having it
Oh, the milk went bad while I was in jail
Cool
Would you, uh, care to hang on to it for a while
It wouldn't be legal, but if it makes you feel better, I guess  Well, thanks
I got one now
You went out this morning and bought a gun
What
You went out this morning and bought a gun
Well, let's say I got one now, okay

I'm going to do what you suggested offer to help and see what happens
What I meant was to have a lawyer do the negotiating for you
I know more now about Ordell's money
Well, if it's the A.T.F
guy that wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point
I know, but it's a lot of money
It's a half a million dollars all in Cabo, and more coming in
Ordell told me last night
He called?
He came by
What'd you do
We talked
He had his doubts at first, but he's always trusted me
And he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can
Because he needs my ass
Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit over there in Cabo
You want some sugar
No, thank you
Maybe, but I'm the only one he's ever used
I mean, he can't use his other people
They're crooks
I mean, he might try to... bring the money in himself,  but he ain't gonna wanna stand in no customs lines
So, either he recruits another Cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me
And I made him feel like he still can
Yeah, if I get off
Otherwise, fuck 'em

Well, I ain't going back to jail and I ain't doing that probation thing again
Max, how do you feel about getting old
You're not old

Really
I guess I got sensitive about my hair a few years ago
It started falling out, so I did something about it
I feel fine with it
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it
I did it to feel better about myself, and, you know, I do
I look in the mirror
Looks like me
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in this department

You're a fine motherfucker

But it don't matter, 'cause they already know I'm meeting you

You told  3.25
Here
Thank you, sir
You told 'em it's me
They already know it's you
Goddamn, that don't mean you got to confirm it
Look, the only way they're going to give me permission to fly...  is if I agree to help 'em, which is what I have to appear to be doing
So I might as well give them somebody they already knowyou
Goddamn You told them all that
It's true, ain't it
What the fuck that got to do with anything
They know I'm delivering for you
I told 'em about the half mil
They could give a fuck about it
All they wanna do is catch your ass with guns
Let me bring in the money.
And they said
Hey, what's the matter
I mean, that's what we discussed last night
This is just seeming kind of risky now, you know
Fuck this
I make two deliveries the first with 10,000
You know, like a dry run
They watch it, see how it works
Then the second delivery, I come home with the half mil
See, that's too much exposure
Now, I ain't goin' nowhere near that money
You don't have to
I told them you never pick up the money yourself
You always send someone, and I never know who it is
Mm
That's a good idea
Now, the first time I do it, they're looking around,  they see me hand the 10,000 to someone
I don't know
A friend of yours
Like a woman
If you want
Yeah
Wait a minute
If they're gonna let you go,   how come we don't bring all the cash in the first time
Now, the next trip, when I bring in the half mils,  it's gonna look like I'm doing the same thing as I did before
But you don't?
No
I hand it to someone else first
Hmm
And they follow the wrong one,  thinking she's bringing the money to me
That's the idea
Can you cover that?
Yeah
Yeah, I got the women covered
Where are you planning on puling this off?
And I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
It's my plan
We're in this together
Yeah, but it's my money and I don't need no fuckin' partners
I ain't your partner
And I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands,  and I'm managing to do it all under the nose of the cops
So, therefore, I'm your manager, and a manager gets 1 5%
No, a manager gets ten percent
I'm gonna give you ten
No
No
I'm getting 1 5%, all right?
All I'm gonna give you is ten
And the same deal as before
I can do that
See, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit
He's acting like he's this big international arms dealer...  when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers
Well, he seems to be making out
Is it dead?
Yeah
Yeah, well... so far, he is
Oh..
I wouldn't go so far as to say that
What does that tell you?
Let's say that he's streetwise, you know
We'll give him that
He's still a fuckup
He killed a man who worked for him the other day
That I should get out of here?
You know where he went?
He went to go meet that stewardess
Does that bother you?
Please
Well, I don't know
He just drops in and out
Did he tell you about that half million he's got down in Mexico?
Uhhuh
Of course he did
He tells anybody who’s gonna listen
They're scheming on how they can get that money over here
And your point is?
Let him and the stewardess get the money over here,  Uhhuh
and then just take it from them
just tried to stare me down ♪   Can I ask you a question?
Oh, man
It's just about Melanie
You know what?
I'm really sorry about that, man,  but I had to be somewhere all of a sudden
I figured, well, shit, Louis ain't had no pussy for a while
So I thought, let him kick it here with Mel
♪ The things that you do ♪  So, what she say?
She didn't have to say shit
I know Melanie
Melanie really good about throwing a fuck a nigger's way
I mean, she ain't no damn good at it, but she likes to fuck
Is that what you thought?
No, I wasn't sure
I didn't know
But you fucked her anyway?
Oh
Well, I hope you felt appropriately guilty afterwards
Afterwards, I did
you know, what is she to you?
You know, she's just one of the bitches I got set up
I got Mel over in Hermosa Beach,  and I rent this little place for Simone over in Compton where you’re staying,  and about four blocks away I got this young 1 9yearold country girl named Sheronda
I found her on the bus stop two days out of Georgia,  barefoot, country as a chicken coop
Took her to my place in Compton, told her it was Hollywood
She believed you?
To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood
Closest she ever been, anyway
But you trust Melanie around your business?
She trying to play your ass against me, ain't she?
Yeah
Uhhuh
See, I knew it
I knew it
See, you didn't have to say nothing
I know that bitch
I don't understand why you keep someone around your business and you can't even trust 'em
I ain't gotta trust her
I don't know what that means, man
Well, I don't understand why you keep her the fuck around
I told you, man
She's my fine little surfer girl
You know, she ain't pretty as she used to be...  and she bitch a whole lot more than she used to,  but she white

Now, the money's gonna be in a Dell Amo shopping bag, all right?
I get some food, sit down here in the food court, then your girl comes in
Did you find somebody yet?

She's gonna be cool, promise

Mmhmm
I'm gonna roll up over here and check out this shirt I was looking at
I'll catch you
Shit
Max
Hey
Well, hello
Hey, surprise
I walked right past you
I know, ignoring me
So, what are you up to?
What'd you see?
What the fuck is up with this shit?
I called you last night
I got your message
Ray wanted to have dinner with me so we can, you know, talk about the sting we're plotting
That's what he calls it, a sting
He's been He's been really nice
Maybe
But I'm thinking it's something more like he wants the money for himself
No
He just tries to act cool
You know, I don't think there's anything wrong with that
He's just a young guy having fun being a cop
I know the type
Trust me on this
If he does anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction,  but he wouldn't walk off with the money:, it's evidence
And what about you, Max?
What?
If I was in Nicolet's place?
No, I mean you right now, not if you were somebody else
If I saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
It's not like it's somebody's life savings
It wouldn't even be missed
You're avoiding the question, Max
Okay, sure, I guess I'd be tempted,  especially now since I'm getting out of the bail bond business
Why?
A lot of reasons
I guess the main one would be, uh..
When did you decide?
It's been a long time coming,  but I finally made up my mind
I guess it was... Thursday
Yes?
I'm Max Cherry, your bail bondsman
Yeah
I went to pick up this guy
I hear he's staying at a house, and, uh..
I sneak in and I'm waiting for him  Wait a minute
After we were together, you snuck into a guy's house
I went back to my office and found out that you took my gun,  got another gun and the stun gun,  went to this guy's house in Ell Monte and waited for him to come home
What do you do when he comes home?
Shoot him with the stun gun
While he's incapacitated, you cuff him and take him to County
You do that?
It's my job
Well, the guy never came home
But I'm sitting on his couch in the dark holding my stun gun
The whole house smells of cat pee
And after a couple of hours, I think,  "What am I doing this?
And I make up my mind
That's it
I'm not sure you answered my question, Max
Which one?
If you had the chance, unemployed now,  to walk away with a half million dollars,  would you take it?
How was your flight?
Fine
Yeah
This is A.T.F

Sheronda, that's a nice name
You can eat
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you
All right
I’ll be back
I'll check the bag
Stay here
Max, you said it yourself
He doesn't give a shit about the money
The money won't convict him
Guns will
You're rationalizing
You rationalize
I can do it, Max
I know I can

No, ma'am

Jackie, Louis
That chick you saw stomping around the back there,  that's Melanie who about to leave
Have a good time in there, baby
Don't burn now
Want a drink?
No
I want to talk to you now, outside
Mm
Let's step into my office
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The day I follow Audrey Hill Clayton   What's up?
You got that we do it the way I laid out, or we don't do it at al
What the hell you talkin' about?
What the hell I'm talkin' about?
Sheronda passed the money on to somebody else
How do you know she did that?
I was there
You weren't supposed to be there
Hold on
I ain't puling no shit
What do you call it, then?
I can do what the fuck I wanna do with it
With my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't
If we don't do it my way, then fuck it
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie
Now chill
Chill
Chill, my ass
No
Listen
Listen
The woman you saw was my friend Simone
I think she oughta see how the shit go down
She's a nice woman
You'll like her
Matter of fact, she's on her way over here right now
Hold on
Tell her to get her ass over here
Damn
That what you’re pissed off about?
Oh, just a little pissed?
Mm, mm, mm
I'm sorry
I'm about ready for a refill
Come on
Okay, fine
Yeah
You better give me something strong
Now, Nicolet and Dargas are gonna stop me at the airport and mark your bills
It washes off!
I tell 'em we do the same thing as before, and they'll follow Sheronda
Yo, Louis
Louis
Yo
No answer
Hmm?
Lou
Hmm?
Right
The same one Simone gives me, okay?
Now, Simone and I make the switch in Bilingsley
She's seen you with Sheronda, remember?
All right
Now, Simone's gonna meet you in the dress department, right
Right
Designer clothes
The place y'all try shit on
It's a fitting room
Big sign over the door
You can't miss it
Uh  Why over there?
That's why we can't take the risk in doing it out in the open...  or even in the dining area
That's why we got to do it in the fitting room with a woman
Okay
Now, you're going to take...  the Bilingsley bag Simone gives you and give it to Sheronda
And Simone gon' to wait
Then she's going to peep out the dressing room, wait on you...  to give her the sign there ain't nobody watching
She's going to leave the store, get in the car, mission accomplished
See?
So, what are you going to be doing during all this
Now that you got 'em watching my ass, I'm gonna be in a titty bar waiting on Louis...  to call me and tell me everything's cool
I got to go
Hey
Who's wantin' to page you like that?
It's Ray, the A.T.F
guy
That shit work my nerves, you and that motherfucker being so buddybuddy
Hey, if I wasn't so buddybuddy with that motherfucker, this wouldn't work
You two meet?
Yeah, this afternoon before I came here
He was at Ordell’s apartment in Hermosa Beach
Yeah
I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out
Not really
His full name's Louis Gara
Just did four years up in Susanville
For what?
Bank robbery
We've been following him
They did two years together about, I don't know,  20 years ago or so over at Huntsville
He's not living over in Hermosa Beach, though
Living with some 56yearold petty thief, some woman named, uh...  Hawkins, Simone Hawkins
Hmm
You know her
No
They ever talk about her?
Not yet
Okay, who's the other one?
What's her deal?
Oh, yeah?
She knows everything
She's not a part of it,  and she's pissed off that she's not a part of it
Well, this is definitely somebody I wanna meet
Okay, are we all set up for tomorrow
Everything okay
I told him Ordell’s changing the amount he's bringing in
Think they bought it?
Mm, oh, yeah
I got 'em thinking that Ordell’s real nervous,  and they love thinking that he's scared of' em
All he needed was a reasonable explanation
Everything's the same, except for one change
What's that?
So he's sweating a little bit
He's gonna keep his half mil where it is,  but he's gonna bring in 50,000 just in case he needs bail
It'll be more than that
Don't be so literal
Ray believed it
You still have to show him the money at the airport
I'm not gonna show him the whole amount
And where's the rest of it?
In the bag, underneath
What if he checks
He won't
You're taking a hell of a chance, kid
Not really
If he finds it, I'll say Mr. Walker put it in there...  and I didn't know anything about it, like the coke
Well, then you're out
Yeah, but I'm not in jail...  and at least I tried
You're going to have surveillance all over you
That's why you don't make a move until I come out of that fitting room
Wearing a dress
There's this one I had my eye on
You know, it's like  Excuse me
Hello
Look here, we got a little change in plans
No, no, no, no, it ain't no thing
Everything's the same, except one little difference
You know that bitch Simone you saw in the mal?
Well, she wasn't here today 'cause she done split on my ass
Me and Louis went by her pad
She gone
She gone, her shit's gone and my 10,000 motherfucking dollars is gone
Don't start buggin' on me
Everything's just like we discussed
Now, except for this time when we make the split,  instead of Simone it's gonna be Melanie
I think someone's knocking on the door
Goddamn it, Melanie got just as much sense as that bitch has, she'd be in the same place
All right
Yeah, later
Yeah
I hope he's a good sailor
Chicken shit
Okay, the envelope contains $50,000
I've counted it, and I 'm now marking the bills...  in the upper lefthand corner in the second zero with a green felttip pen
What?
Mmhmm
If I did, I'd have to give one to you, wouldn't I?
Of course, nobody knows how much there is
I guess we could take as much as we want
Isn't that right?
Yes
All those things are true
I mean, it's not like the money belongs to anybody
Yeah
Except it's not a point of view shared by the A.T.F
Once we make this evidence, it belongs to us
You're officially out of trouble now
You know, I'm glad you pointed that out,  'cause it saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you
Now, look
Here's the deal
I want you to take all this cash
And that is exactly what I expect to see...  when I look inside Sheronda's Bilingsley shopping bag

L.A.P.D
And we lost Ordell
I thought you were fuckin' watchin' him
We were, and we lost him
He walked into a strip bar sometime around 3:30 and never came out
The bar was on Ninth, what, less than a mile and a half from where they found Louis
So what's gonna happen now?
We pick up Ordell
We got three murders we can link him to, and we got you
What about me?
What about you?
You think I took some of that money?
I'm glad to see that
You've been helpin' us out
You gave us Melanie
You gave us Louis
Melanie was found with a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts
That goes a long way in backing up your story
I'll settle for Ordell with marked bills
But if there's anything else...  you haven't told me about, you know what, that's between you and Ordell
You better hope we find him before he finds you
No, no, no, I done told you, I can't leave here tomorrow, Mr. Walker
I ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till I get my motherfuckin' money
Come on, man, if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have that motherfuckin' boat
I'm seein' who my friends are, motherfucker, right  Hello?
Hello?
You believe that shit?
Ingrate nigger
Motherfuck
Shit
Goddamn, girl
How you live like this?
Like what?
Like this
This some repugnant shit
Bail bonds
Well, where he at?
Out of town?
He's around, man
Well, give me his home number
No, I'll give you his beeper number
Break out the beeper number, nigger
♪     Yeah
I've been looking for you
This is Mr. Robbie, isn't it?
I have your 10,000
That's why you called
The bond collateral that you put down on Beaumont Livingston...  and moved over to Miss Brown, remember?
Oh, she got off, did she?
They decided to nofile this morning
I'll come give you your money
You still there?
I know you helped her
And I know you know what I want
And Jackie can tell me any story comes into her pretty little head,  as long as at the end of that story she hands me my motherfuckin' money
Now, she wanna be my friend, she do that
She don't want to be my friend no more,  well, you just tell her to think about old Beaumont
And we'll go upstate, hand in handcuffed motherfuckin' hand
And that's a promise
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
You tell her that, and I'll call you back
It was Ordell
If you have time, do you think you could find out where he's stayin' for me?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Sure thing
I don't have to know what I'm doing, just as long as you know
I think I do
Good enough?
Fuck's wrong with you, knockin' on the door like the goddamned police?
You lookin' to get shot?
I thought you might be asleep
You keep fuckin' with me, you the one gonna be asleep forever
I'm alone
Get your ass in the house
No, freeze, motherfucker
What you doin'?
I have a receipt for you to sign
No, no, no, motherfucker
You know what I mean
You talked to her?
If she didn't, there'd be cops batterramming your door down right now
How'd you find me, anyway?
Winston found you
How'd he find me?
That's what he does
Oh, well, bully for that nigger
So, she wanna give me my money, huh?
Yeah
She wants to give it to you herself, and she wants to collect her ten percent
Oh, and I wanna hear that shit too
Turn around
Put your hands on your head
Why don’t you tell me why?
She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her,  split the half million amongst themselves
What she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money
And you helped her, didn’t you?
All I did was walk out with it
In a way, yes
My ass may be dumb, but I ain't no dumb ass
Go over there and sit on that couch
She don't even know you’re here
Sit down
Place stinks
You get used to it
Where my money at?
Where Jackie at?
She's been there since Thursday night
If she want to talk to me, how come she wasn't home?
She's afraid
Oh, right
That I gotta see
She doesn't wanna get shot before she can tell you what happened
Tell her to bring the money over here
Call her and give her the combination
Look, I'm tellin' you, you got her spooked
She won't leave there till you get your money and you're gone
Oh, you expect me to just go walkin' in there?
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody by now
She believed you
Mmm
Then that's why she wanted to give me my money, ain't it?
It ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about Melanie, huh?
That was my little blondehaired surfer girl
And I told that fuckin' Louis all he had to do was hit her in the mouth
But no, he had to shoot her
Uhhuh
She by herself?
That bigass nigger Winston ain't there, is he?
She's all alone
I call over there, she better answer the phone
She will
I'll be here
See you in a bit
Goddamn
In all the time I've known her,  I ain't never heard her scared like that
Hold up, home
Give me the keys
I'll drive
They're pretty good

Yeah
Goddamn, girl
What you doin' sittin' off in here in the dark?
Ray, he's got a gun
Yeah, he's dead
Does he have the marked bills on him
He oughta have 40,000 in his pocket there...  and maybe another 1 0,000 I gave him
Why’d you give him $10,000
Returned a bond collateral
Brought it to him so he wouldn't have to come here
Well, how'd you know where he was?
I found him
That's my job
You guys didn't tell the police?
I told Jackie
Ray?
Mmhmm
Well, you did
Thanks
Knock, knock
Hey
Hey, you
I got your package
Less ten percent
Why'd you take so little?
That's my fee
This isn't a bail bond, Max
II hesitated takin' that much
Well, I'm leavin' now, and, you know, I'm all packed up, ready to go   That's Ordell’s
Registration was in the glove box
Keys were underneath the seat
Hey
What's the matter
Haven’t you ever borrowed somebody's car before
Not after they're dead
I didn't use you, Max
And I never lied to you
I know that
We're partners
I'm 56years old
Do you blame yourself for helpin' me?
Look, I'd really feel a whole lot better if you took some more money
You'll get over that
Where you goin'?
Spain
Madrid or Barcelona?
Mmm, Madrid first
Have you been there?
You wanna go?
Thanks, but, uh, you have a good time
Thanks for sayin' that, but no
Are you scared of me?
I'll send you a postcard
Will you?
I sure will, partner
You're running a business, Max
Uh, what is it your son's charged with?
Yes, that's a very serious offense
Is your son still in school?
Does his father still live in the house
Would you call me back in about half an hour?
Yes, thank you

No, kiddo

Sarah, I cannot believe you are early
What you got
I got your ass
Remember that
Huh
Remember
Come on, bitch
Come on
Bring it on
Hey, baby
How was school
Oh
That goodfornothing dog of yours got his ass  in the living room and acted a damn fool
That's what happened, baby
Barney did this
Baby, now, you can't come in here
There's broken glass everywhere, and you could cut yourself
Hi, honey
I'm  What's your name
Her name is Nikki
Nikki
Such a pretty name for such a pretty girl
Nikki, asked you a question
I'm 4
4 years old, eh
She'd be about 4 now
Now, baby, me and Mommy's friend got some grownup talk  to talk about
You can go in your room now
Okay
Nikkia
In your room
Now
You want some coffee
Yeah
Sure
Her husband is Dr. Lawrence Bell
But back when we were acquainted, four years ago,  her name was Vernita Green
Her code name was Copperhead
Do you have a towel
Yeah
Thanks
You still take cream and sugar
Yeah
You suppose correctly
You can relax for now
I'm not gonna murder you in front of your child, okay
That's being more rational  than Bill led me to believe you were capable of
It's mercy, compassion and forgiveness I lack
Look
I know I fucked you over
I fucked you over bad
I wish to God I hadn't, but I did
You have every right to want to get even
No, no, no, no, no
No
That'd be even, Vernita
That'd be about square
Look, if I could go back in a machine, I would
But I can't
Oh, great
I don't care
Be that as it may,  I know I don't deserve your mercy or your forgiveness
However, I beseech you for both on behalf of my daughter
You and I have unfinished business
And not a goddamn fucking thing you've done  in the subsequent four years,  including getting knocked up, is gonna change that
So when do we do this
It all depends
When do you wanna die
The day after tomorrow
How about tonight, bitch
Splendid
Where
There's a baseball diamond where I coach little league  about a mile from here
We meet there around 2:30 in the morning,  dressed all in black, your hair in a black stocking
We won't be bothered
Now, I have to fix Nikki's cereal
Bill said you were one of the best ladies he saw  with an edged weapon
I know he didn't qualify that shit
So you can just kiss my motherfucking ass, Black Mamba
Black Mamba
I should have been motherfucking Black Mamba
If you wanna stick with your butcher knife, that's fine
Very funny, bitch
Very funny
For that, I'm sorry
But you can take my word for it
Your mother had it coming
When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it..
I'll be waiting
For those regarded as warriors..
Suppress all human emotion and compassion...  ...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be Lord God, or Buddha himself
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat
Come on out to Dallas
This is Rockabilly Rhythms on KTRN, Wichita Falls
Very own wild man, Charlie Feathers
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop
They wiped out the whole wedding party, execution style
Give me a figure
Nine dead bodies
Bride
Groom
Reverend
Reverend's wife
They even shot that old colored fella that plays the organ
Good gravy, Marie
What'd I tell you, Pop
It's like a goddamn Nicaraguan death squad
You're in a house of worship
Sorry, Pop
Well, this is definitely the work of professionals
I'd guesstimate Mexican Mafia hit squad
Four, maybe five strong
Well, a sure and steady hand did this
This ain't no squirrelly amateur
This is the work of a salty dog
You can tell by the cleanliness of the carnage
Now, a killcrazy rampage, though it may be,  all the colors are kept inside the lines
If you was a moron, you could almost admire it
Don't know
That's a fake
We've been calling her "The Bride"  on account of the dress
You can tell she was pregnant
Man would have to be a mad dog  to shoot a goddamn goodlooking gal like that in the head
Look at her
Haycolored hair
Big eyes
Son Number One
This tall drink of cocksucker ain't dead
I might never have liked you
Point in fact, I despise you
But that shouldn't suggest that I don't respect you
My gift to you
For fuck's sake
Hello, Bill
What's her condition
Comatose
Where is she
I'm standing over her right now
That's my girl
What
We owe her better than that
Oh, you don't owe her shit
You don't owe her shit
May I say one thing
Speak
Y'all beat the hell out of that woman
And I put a bullet in her head
But her heart just kept on beating
Now, you saw that yourself  with your own beautiful blue eye, did you not
And if she ever wakes up, we'll do a whole lot more
But one thing we won't do  is sneak into her room in the night like a filthy rat  and kill her in her sleep
And the reason we won't do that thing  is because that thing would lower us
I guess
Do you really have to guess
No
I don't really have to guess
I know
Come on home, honey
Affirmative
I love you, too
Thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you
Word of advice, shithead
Don't you ever wake up
Bill, it's your baby
Oh, my baby
Four years
Four years
The price is $75 a fuck, my friend
You getting your freak on or what
Oh, yeah, boy
20, 40, 60, 75
Now here's the rules
Rule number one
No punching her
Nurse comes in and she got a shiner  or less some teeth, jig's up
And by the way, this cunt's a spitter
It's a motorreflex thing
Now, are clear on rule one
Yeah
Good
Now, rule number two
In fact, no leaving no marks of no kind
After that, it's all good, buddy
Now, her plumbing down there don't work
So feel free to come in her all you want
Keep the noise down
Try not to make a mess
Oh, shit
By the way, not all the time, but sometimes  this chick's cooch can get drier than a bucket of sand
If she dry, lube up with this and you'll be good to go
Bon appetit, good buddy
Oh, yeah
Oh, God damn
You are the bestlooking girl I've had today
Time's up, buddy
Hey buddy, did you have yourself a good time
Where's Bill
Where's Bill
Please stop hitting me
I don't know who Bill is
Bullshit
Well, ain't you the slice of cutie pie they said you was
Jane Doe, huh
We don't know shit about you, do we
I'm from Huntsville, Texas
My name is Buck, and I'm here to fuck
Your name is Buck
And you came here to fuck
Right
Wait a minute
Wait
You fucker
Texas
Wiggle your big toe
Wiggle your big toe
Wiggle your big toe
Wiggle your big toe
As I lay in the back of Buck's truck,  trying to will my limbs out of entropy...  Wiggle your big toe
...I could see the faces of the cunts who did this to me
And the dicks responsible
When fortune smiles on something  as violent and ugly as revenge,  it seems proof like no other that not only does God exist,  you're doing his will
At a time when I knew the least about my enemies,  the first name on my death list,  ORen Ishii, was the easiest to find
But when one manages the difficult task  of becoming queen of the Tokio underworld,  one doesn't keep it a secret, does one
The halfJapanese, halfChinese American Army brat  made her first acquaintance with death at the age of 9
It was at that age she witnessed  the death of her parents at the hands  of Japan's most ruthless yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto
Mommy
She swore revenge
Luckily for her, Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile
At 11, she got her revenge
Look at me, Matsumoto...  ...take a good look at my face
Look at my eyes
Do I look familiar
By 20, she was one of the top female assassins in the world
At 25, she did her part in the killing  of nine innocent people, including my unborn daughter,  in a small wedding chapel in El Paso, Texas
But on that day four years ago she made one big mistake
She should have killed 10
However, before satisfaction would be mine,  first things first
Hard part's over
Now, let's get these other piggies wiggling
Welcome to Air O
May I help you
Okinawa
Oneway
Welcome..
Welcome
Almost
American
American
Welcome, American
Domo
You said "domo.
Can you speak Japanese
You said "domo.
No, no
Just a few words I learned since yesterday
Um, may I sit at the bar
Oh, sure, sure, sure
Please, sit
What other words did you learn
We have a customer
Bring out some tea, quickly
Lazy bastard...  Screw your soap opera..
Hurry up
Why don't you serve it yourself for once
Shut up
Get your ass out here
Uh, excuse me
Oh, let's see
Um, "arigato.
"Arigato.
Good
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
"Konnitchiwa.
"Kohnneecheewah.
Konnichi wa
Please repeat
Konnichi wa
Perfect
You say Japanese word like you Japanese
Oh, you're making fun of me
Serious business
Pronunciation very good
You say arigato like we say arigato
Well, thank you
You should learn Japanese
Very easy
No kidding
Most difficult
But you have Japanese tongue
Okay, okay
Oh
Oh, my God
Hurry up... goddammit
Lazy oaf...  What d'ya want
I beg your pardon
Oh, yes
A bottle of warm sake, please
Warm sake
One warm sake
Sake
In the middle of the day
Day, night, afternoon  Who gives a damn Get the sake
How come I always have to get the sake
You listen well...  For thirty years, you make the fish, I get the sake
If this were the military,  I'd be General by now
Oh, so you'd be General, huh
Do you understand
I'm not bald, okay
I shaved my head
Do you understand me
Oh
First time in Japan
Uhhuh
Oh
What brings you to Okinawa
Oh, yeah
You have a friend live in Okinawa
Not quite
Not friend
I never met him
Who is he
May I ask
Hattori Hanzo
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo
I need Japanese steel
Why do you need Japanese steel
You must have big rats, you need Hattori Hanzo's steel
Huge
You may
Wait
Try the second one down
You like samurai swords
I like baseball
I wanted to show you these
However...  ...someone as you, who knows so much, must surely know..
...I no longer make instruments of death
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value
Yet proud as I am of my life's work..
...I have retired
Then give me one of these
I didn't say "sell me.
I said "give me.
Because my vermin is a former student of yours
And considering the student,  I'd say you have a rather large obligation
You can sleep here
It will take me a month...  ...to make the sword
I suggest you spend it practicing
I've completed doing...  ...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,  ...to never do again
And in that purpose, I was a success
I've done this because philosophically,  I am sympathetic to your aim
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword
If on your journey, you should encounter God...  ...God will be cut
Yellowhaired warrior...  Go
Domo
When the final sword was sheathed,  it was ORen Ishii and her powerful posse...  ...the Crazy 88, that proved the victor
The pretty lady to ORen's right,  who's dressed like she's a villain on "Star Trek,"  is ORen's lawyer, best friend, and second lieutenant
Another former protegee of Bill's
The young girl in the schoolgirl uniform  is ORen's personal bodyguard, 17yearold Gogo Yubari
Do you like Ferraris
Ferrari... ltalian trash
Do you want to screw me
Don't laugh
Do you want to screw me, yes or no
Yes
Do you still wish to penetrate me...  ...or is it I...  ...or is it I... who has penetrated you
See what I mean
The bald guy in the black suit and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,  the head general of ORen's personal army, the Crazy 88
And just in case you were wondering  how could a halfbreed JapaneseChinese American  become the boss of all bosses in Tokio, Japan,  I'll tell you
The night ORen assumed power over the crime council
The man who seems bound and determined  to break the mood is Boss Tanaka
And what Boss Tanaka thinks is...  Boss Tanaka
This is a time for celebration
And what exactly are we celebrating
The perversion of our illustrious council
Tanaka, have you gone mad
You're disrespecting our sister
Apologize
TanakaSan, of what perversion do you speak
My father...  ...along with yours,  and along with yours, started this council
Shut up
...over the perversion committed today
Outrageous
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council
Bastard
Fuck face
Gentlemen
By all means, allow him to express it
I speak, of the perversion done to this council,  ...which I love...  ...more than my own children,  ...by making a Chinese JapAmerican half breed bitch its leader
...I'm going to say this in English
As your leader..
If you're unconvinced  a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest,  tell me so
But allow me to convince you
And I promise you, right here and now,  no subject will ever be taboo
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion
The price you pay  for bringing up either my Chinese or American heritage  as a negative is, I collect your fucking head
Just like this fucker here
I didn't think so
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned
Moshi moshi
Hey
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Gogo
They demand ridiculous things
Shut up... Do you know what would happen if they heard you
What's gonna happen
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan
You're gonna get your head chopped off
No, I don't want that
Yes, it's me
Who do you remind me of
You're right, he does look like Charlie Brown
Charlie Brown
Four pepperoni pizzas
That's not on our menu..
I don't care, bring them, goddammit
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss
ORen Ishii
Charlie Brown, beat it
Miki
So, ORen, any more subordinates for me to kill
Hi
Gogo, right
Bingo
And you're Black Mamba
Don't they
Gogo, I know you feel you must protect your mistress
But I beg you
You call that begging
You can beg better than that
Is that what I think it is
You know, for a second there, yeah, I kind of did
Silly rabbit
Trix are for..
Kids
#  # Ain't nobody doin' but me, baby #  # Nobody but me #  # Well, let me tell you nobody #  # Nobody but me #  # Well, let me tell you nobody #  # Nobody #  This is what you get for fucking around with yakuzas
Go home to your mother
Those of you lucky enough to still have your lives...  ...take them with you
However...  ...leave the limbs you've lost
Except you, Sofie
You stay right where you are
Your instrument is quite impressive
Where was it made
Okinawa
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel
This is Hattori Hanzo steel
Swords however, never get tired
I hope you've saved your energy
But as last looks go,  you could do worse
Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords
You may not be able to fight like a samurai
But you can at least die like a samurai
Attack me...  ...with everything you have
...I apologize
Accepted
Ready
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword
Sofie
Sofie
I'm so sorry
Please
Please forgive my betrayal
But still..
But still nothing
Except my aching heart over what she's done  to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie
I've kept you alive for two reasons
The first reason is information
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde
I'll tell you nothing
And every time you don't give me answers,  I'm gonna cut something off
And I promise you, they will be things you will miss
I want all the information on the Deadly Vipers
If you had to guess...  What they've been doing
Why she left you alive...  And where I can find them
What would be your guess
She informed me
She said I could keep my wicked life for two reasons
As I said before,  I've allowed you to keep your wicked life for two reasons
And the second reason is so you can tell him, in person,  everything that happened here tonight
I want him to witness the extent of my mercy  by witnessing your deformed body
I want him to know what I know
I want him to know I want him to know
Revenge is never a straight line
It's a forest
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...  ...to get lost... to forget where you came in
That woman deserves her revenge
And we deserve to die
How did you find me
I'm the man
One more thing, Sofie
Is she aware her daughter is still alive
Master..
Your Mandarin is lousy
You bray like an ass
You are not to speak unless spoken to
I speak Japanese very well..
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese..
I asked if you understand Cantonese
A little
If you can't understand me..
I will communicate with you like l would a dog
When l yell, when l point, when l beat you with my stick
Yes, he is
Your master tells me... you're not entirely unschooled
What training do you possess
I am proficient in TigerCrane Style,  And l am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the Samurai sword
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword
Don't make me laugh
Your socalled exquisite art, is only fit for...  Japanese fat heads
No
Are you aware l kill at will
Yes
Is it your wish to die
No
Then you must be stupid...  Then you must be stupid... so stupid
Rise, and let me look at your ridiculous face
Rise
What's the matter
Cat got your tongue
Oh yes, you speak Japanese
Go to that rack
Remove the sword
Let's see how good you really are
From here you can get an excellent view of my foot
Your swordsmanship... is amateur at best
I asked you to demonstrate... what you know... and you did...  Not a goddamn thing
Let's see your Tiger Crane... match my Eagle's Claw
Like all Yankee women...  ... all you can do is order in restaurants and spend a man's money
Excruciating... isn't it
Yes
If it was my wish...  ... l could chop your arm off
No, please don't
It's my arm now
I can't
Because you're helpless
Yes
Have you ever felt this before
No
Compared to me... you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle
YES!!
THAT'S THE BEGlNNlNG
Yes
Your training will begin... tomorrow
Since your arm now belongs to me...  ... l want it strong
I can, but not that close
Then you can't do it
What if your enemy... is three inches in front of you...  ... What do you do then...  ... Curl into a ball...  ... or do you put your FlST through him
It's the wood that should fear your hand...   not the other way around
No wonder you can't do it... you acquiesce to defeat...   before you even begin
If you want to eat like a dog...  You can live and sleep outside like a dog
Come on, you bitch
OK, Pai Mei
Here l come
Elle, you treacherous dog
It's too risky
I'm through doing that shit
You always say that
The same thing every time
"I'm through, never again, too dangerous.
I know that's what I always say
I'm always right too
The days of me forgetting are over
The days of me remembering have just begun
You know, when you go on like this, what you sound like
You sound like a duck
Quack, quack, quack
Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again
Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack
After tonight
Can I get anyone more coffee
Oh, yes
Thank you
You're welcome
I mean, the way it is now, you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank
Takin' more of a risk
Banks are easier
They're insured
Why should they give a fuck
I don't even need a gun in a federal bank
Heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone
He gives the phone to a teller
If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill her.
Fuckin' right it worked
That's what I'm talkin' about
Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone...  not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone
They don't lift a fuckin' finger
Did they hurt the little girl
There probably never was a little girl
The point of the story isn't a little girl
The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone
You want to rob banks
I'm not saying I wanna rob banks
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we've been doing
What've we been talkin' about
Yeah, no more liquor stores
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores
You tell 'em empty out the register, they don't know what you're talkin' about
They make it too personal
We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him
I'm not gonna kill anybody
But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them
And if it's not the gooks...  it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations
Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone
See how far that gets you
Forget it
We're out of it
Well, what then, day jobs
Not in this life
<i>Garcon, coffee!</i>  This place
Garcon means boy
This place
A coffee shop
Nobody ever robs restaurants
Why not
Bars, liquor stores...  gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them
Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down
Not as expectin' anyway
I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this
Correct
Same as banks, these places are insured
He don't give a fuck
They're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin' the diners
Waitresses
No way they're takin' a bullet for the register
Some wetback gettin' paid $1 .50 an hour...  really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner
Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on
One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet...  the next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face
See, I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up, remember
All the customers kept comin' in
Yeah
Now, that was a good idea
Thank you
Made more from the wallets than we did from the register
Yes, we did
A lot of wallets
Pretty smart, huh
Pretty smart
I'm ready
Right now, right here
Come on
Same as last time, remember
You're crowd control
I'll handle the employees
I love you, pumpkin
I love you, honey bunny
This is a robbery
Any of you fucking pricks move...  and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you
<i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get down with the boogie.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get it on.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get down with the boogie.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get it on.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get up with the boogie.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get up with the get down.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get down and boogie.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Shake it around.</i>   Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars
Okay, what you want to know
Hash is legal there, right
Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal
I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places
Those are hash bars
It breaks down like this
It's legal to buy it
It's legal to own it
And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it
It's illegal to carry it, but that doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this
I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have
Oh, man
I'm goin'
That's all there is to it
I'm fuckin' goin'
I know, baby
But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is
What
I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here...   but it's just there, it's a little different
Example
You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer
And I don't mean just like no paper cup
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer
And in Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonald's
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese
They got the metric system
They wouldn't know what the fuck a quarterpounder is
They call it a Royale with Cheese
Royale with Cheese
What do they call a Big Mac
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac
Le Big Mac
I don't know
I didn't go into Burger King
You know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup
What
Mayonnaise
Goddamn
I seen 'em do it, man
They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit
We should have shotguns for this kind of deal
How many up there
That's countin' our guy
Not sure
So that means that it could be up to five guys up there
It's possible
What's her name
Mia
Mia
How did Marsellus and her meet
I don't know
She used to be a actress
She do anything I'd have seen
I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot
Pilot
What's a pilot
Well, you know the shows on TV
I don't watch TV
Yeah, but you are aware that there is an invention called television...  and on this invention they show shows, right
The way they pick TV shows is they make one show
That show's called a pilot
Some get chosen and become television programs
Some don't, become nothin'
She starred in one of the ones that became nothing
You remember Antwan Rockamora
Halfblack, halfSamoan
Yeah, maybe
Fat, right
I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat
He got a weight problem
He's Samoan
I think I know who you mean
Marsellus fucked him up good
Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife
So what he'd do
Fuck her
No, no, no, no, no
Well, then what then
He gave her a foot massage
A foot massage
That's it
Then what'd Marsellus do
They took him out on his patio
Threw his ass over the balcony
Nigger fell four stories
He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse
Nigger fell through that
That's a damn shame
But still, you play with matches, you get burned
What do you mean
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage
You don't think he overreacted
A foot massage is nothin'
I give my mother a foot massage
It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife
I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out
No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark
Eatin' the bitch out and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing
It's not
It's the same ballpark
Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither
Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies...  ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport
Have you ever given a foot massage
I'm the foot fuckin' master
You given a lot of them
Shit, yeah
Got my technique down and everything
I don't be ticklin' or nothin'
Would you give a guy a foot massage
Fuck you
You give 'em a lot
You know, I'm kind of tired
I could use a foot massage
Yo, yo, yo, man
You best back off
Yeah, it is
What time you got
7:22 in the a.m.  No, it ain't quite time yet
Come on
Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right...  for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin' house...  fuckin' up the way the nigger talks; that shit ain't right
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker
I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothin'
I'm sayin' it does
Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages, and they all meant somethin'
We act like they don't, but they do
That's what's so fuckin' cool about them
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...  where you don't talk about it, but you know it and she knows it
And Antwan should've fuckin' better known better
That's his fuckin' wife, man
You know what I'm sayin'
It's an interestin' point
Come on
Let's get into character
Mia
Mia
Why you so interested in big man's wife
He's goin' out of town, Florida
And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone
Take care of her
Just take her out
Make sure she don't get lonely
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date
It is not a date
It's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'
It's not a date
It's definitely not a date
Hey, kids
How you boys doin'
Hey, keep chillin'
You know who we are
We're associates of your business partner, Marsellus Wallace
Now, let me take a wild guess here
You're Brett, right
Yeah
You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett
Yeah, I remember
Good
Looks like me and Vincent caught you boys at breakfast
Sorry about that
Hamburgers
The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast
What kind of hamburgers
Cheeseburgers
No, no, no
Where'd you get 'em
Where
Big Kahuna Burger
Big Kahuna Burger
That's that Hawaiian burger joint
I ain't never had one myself
How are they
They're good
You mind if I try one of yours
This is yours here, right
Yeah
Vincent
You ever had a Big Kahuna burger
Want a bite
I ain't hungry
Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime
Me, I can't usually get 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian...  which pretty much makes me a vegetarian
But I do love the taste of a good burger
You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France
Tell 'em, Vincent
A Royale with Cheese
A Royale with Cheese
Because of the metric system
Check out the big brain on Brett
That's right
The metric system
What's in this
Sprite
Good
You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with
Go right ahead
That hit the spot
You
Flock of Seagulls
You know why we're here
It's over..
I don't remember askin' you a goddamned thing
You were sayin'
It's in the cupboard
We happy
Vincent
We happy
Yeah, we happy
I didn't get your name
I got yours
Vincent
Right
No, no, no
I just want you to know how..
I just want you to know how sorry we are that things got so fucked up...  with us and Mr. Wallace
We got into this thing with the best intentions
Really
I never  Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration
I didn't mean to do that
Please
What's the matter
Oh, you were finished
Oh, well, allow me to retort
What does Marsellus Wallace look like
What
What country you from
"What" ain't no country I ever heard of
They speak English in What
What
English, Motherfucker
Do you speak it
Then you know what I'm sayin'
Yes
Describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like
I  Say ' "what" again
Say "what" again
I dare ya
Say ""what" one more goddamn time
He's black
Go on
He's bald
Does he look like a bitch
Does he look... like a bitch
No
Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch, Brett
I didn't
Yes, you did
Yes, you did, Brett
No, no
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace
Yes
Well, there's this passage I got memorized
Sort of fits this occasion
Ezekiel 25:17
"The path of the righteous man..."  is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish...  and the tyranny of evil men
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...  those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
And you will know my name is the Lord...  "when I lay my vengeance upon thee!
I think you gonna find, when all this shit is over and done..
The thing is, Butch...  right now... you got ability
But painful as it may be, ability... don't last
And your days are just about over
Now, that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life
But that's a fact of life your ass is gonna have to get realistic about
Motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine
If you mean it turns to Vinegar... it does
If you mean it gets better with age... it don't
Two
Boxers don't have an oldtimers' day
You came close, but you never made it
And if you were gonna make it, you would have made it before now
You my nigger
The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting
That's pride fuckin' with you
Pride only hurts
It never helps
You fight through that shit
'Cause a year from now, when you kickin' it in the Caribbean...  you gonna say to yourself, "Marsellus Wallace was right.
I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace
In the fifth, your ass goes down
In the fifth, my ass goes down
Yo, Vincent Vega
Our man in Amsterdam
Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood
Get your asses on in here
You don't even want to know
The big man's right over there takin' care of some business
Why don't you hang back a second or two
You see the white boy leave, just go on over
How ya been
How 'bout yourself
All right
So I hear you're takin' Mia out tomorrow
At Marsellus's request
Not yet
What's so fuckin' funny
Not a goddamn thing
I got to piss
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right
It's the big man's wife
I'm gonna sit across from her, chew my food with my mouth closed...  laugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it
Asshole
Gimme a pack of Red Apples
Filters
No
You ain't my friend, palooka
What was that
I think you heard me just fine, punchy
Vincent Vega's in the house
My nigger, get your ass over here
What's up
Man, I'm really sorry
Pack of Red Apples
$1 .40
And some matches
It's as if it turns every part of your body into the tip of a penis
I'll lend it to you
It's a great book on piercing
That gun to pierce your ears, they don't use that to pierce your nipples, do they
Forget that gun
All my piercing, 18 places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle
Excuse me
I was just curious...  but... why would you wear a stud in your tongue
Sex thing
Helps fellatio
Vincenzo
This is Panda from Mexico
Very good stuff
Now, that's Bava
And that is Choco from the Harz Mountains of Germany
Now, the first two are the same
300 a gram
Those are friend prices
But this one is a little more expensive
This is 500 a gram
But, when you shoot it, you will know where that extra money went
This is real, real, real good shit
But this one is a fuckin' madman
Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam
Are we in Inglewood
No
You're in my home
Now, white people who know the difference...  between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...   any old day of the fuckin' week
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince
This is a seller's market
Coke is fuckin' dead as... dead
All right
Gimme three grams of madman
Now, if it's as good as you say it is, I'll come back and buy another thousand
I just hope that I still have some left for ya...  but I'm givin' you some out of my own private stash
That is what a nice guy I am
I'm outta balloons
Is a baggie all right
All right
I'll just get one for ya
Honey, will you get me some baggies and twistix from the kitchen
Okay
Hey, what do you think about Trudi
She ain't got a boyfriend
Which one's Trudi
The one with all the shit in her face
That's my wife
I'm sorry, man
Thank you
No, I can't
I gotta be someplace
All right, no problemo  I'll take a rain check
Still got your Malibu
Oh, man, you know what some fucker did the other day
Fuckin' keyed it
Oh, man, that's fucked up
Tell me about it
I had it in storage for three years
It was out five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucked with it
No trial, no jury, straight to execution
I wish I could've caught him doin' it
I'd have given anything to catch that asshole
It'd been worth him doin' it just so I could've caught him
What's more chickenshit than fuckin' with a man's automobile
Don't fuck with another man's Vehicle
You don't do it
It's just against the rules
Thank you
Mind if I shoot up here

What do you think
I think it's like a wax museum with a pulse
What can I get you
Let's see, steak, steak, steak
Oh, yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak
I'll have that
How do you want that cooked
Bloody as hell, and Oh, yeah, look at thisVanilla coke
What about you, Peggy Sue
I'll have the... Durward Kirby burger, bloody
How do you want that shake, Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy
Martin and Lewis
Did you just order a fivedollar shake
That's a shake
That's milk and ice cream
That's five dollars
No
Just checking
I'll be right back with your drinks
<i>To lonesome town.</i>  <i>To cry my troubles away.</i>  Could you... roll me one of those, cowboy
Thanks
<i>The streets are filled with regret.</i>  Think nothin' of it
<i>Lay me down in lonesome town.</i>  <i> I can learn to forget</i>  So...  Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam
Sure did
How long were you there
Just over three years
No kiddin'
I didn't know that
I heard you did a pilot
That was my 15 minutes
What was it
What
<i> Fox Force Five.</i>  Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks
Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with
And five, as in there's onetwothreefourfive of us
She was the leader
The Japanese fox was a Kung Fu master
The black girl was a demolition expert
French Fox's specialty was sex
What was your specialty
The character I played, Raven McCoy...  her background was she grew up raised by circus performers
According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife
And she knew a zillion old jokes
And if we would have got picked up, they would've worked in a gimmick...  where every show I would've told another joke
You know any of them old jokes
Well, I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show
Tell me
It's corny
Don't be that way
No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed
You'd be embarrYou told 50 million people, and you can't tell me
I promise I won't laugh
That's not what I meant
You know it
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much
What a gyp
Martin and Lewis
Yummy
You think I could have a sip of that
Be my guest
I gotta know what a fivedollar shake tastes like
You can use my straw
I don't have cooties
All right
Goddamn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake
Told ya
I don't know if it was worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good
Don't you hate that
Hate what
Uncomfortable silences
I don't know
That's a good question
That's when you know you found somebody really special
When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence
We just met each other
I'll tell you what
You sit here... and think of something to say
I'll do that
Okay
I said goddamn
Goddamn
I need some hair spray
Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom...  to find your food waiting for you
I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter
Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section
Which one
There's two Monroes
No, there's not
That is Marilyn Monroe
That is Mamie Van Doren
Pretty smart
Yeah
I got my moments
So did you think of somethin' to say
Actually, I did
I don't want to offend you
This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring, gettin'toknowyou chitchat
Well, well, I do
I do
But you have to promise not to be offended
You can't promise somethin' like that
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me
You can ask me what you're gonna ask me...  and my natural response could be to get offended
Let's just forget it
That's an impossibility
Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility
Is that a fact
And besides...  isn't it more exciting when you don't have permission
Well, here goes
What did you think about what happened to Antwan
Who's Antwan
Tony Rocky Horror
He fell out of a window
Well, that is one way to say it
Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out
Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus
Is that a fact
No
No, it's not a fact
It's just what I heard
That's just what I heard
Who told you
They
They certainly do
They certainly do
Don't be shy, Vincent
What else did ""they" say
Did it involve the ' "F" word
No, no, no, no, no
And
And nothin'
That's it
You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourthstory window...  for giving me a foot massage
Well, at the time I was told it sounded reasonable
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourthstory window...  for massaging my feet seemed reasonable
No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen
I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you
A husband being protective of his wife is one thing
A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it... at my wedding
Really
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out that window...  except Marsellus and Tony

Answer
<i>Now what do you say?</i>  <i>I give up
I'll marry you!</i>  Lance
The goddamn phone's ringing
I can hear it
I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call here this late
And that is exactly what I'm going to tell this fucking asshole right now
<i> Don't you dare strike me!</i>  Hello
Vincent
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man
I'm coming to your house
Hold your horses, man
I got this chick, she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me
Well, don't bring her here
I'm not even joking with you
Do not be bringing some fuckedup poohbah to my house
No choice
She's O.D.in'
She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man
Negative
This is not my fuckin' problem, man
You fucked her up, you fuckin' deal with this
I don't know you
Who is this
Don't come here
I'm hanging up the phone
Prank caller
Prank caller
Have you lost your fucking mind
Lance, help me
You crashed your car into my fucking house
Grab her feet
Are you deaf
You are not bringing this fuckedup bitch into my house
This "fuckedup bitch" is Marsellus Wallace's wife
Yeah
If she croaks on me, I am a fucking grease spot
Now, come on, help me, help me
Pick her up
Shit
Lance
Shit
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning
Who's she
Go to the fridge and get the thing with the adrenaline shot
She's O.D.ing
Get her outta here
Get the shot
Fuck you
Fuck you too
Just keep talking to her, all right
She's gettin' the shot
I'm going to go get my little black medical book
What the fuck you need a medical book for
I don't go joypoppin' with bubblegummers
My friends can handle their highs
Get the shot
I am, if you'll let me
Stop talking to me
Start talking to her
Get the shot
All right
We're losing her
I'm looking as fast as I can
What's he looking for
I don't know
Some book
What are you looking for
What are you looking for
It's like a textbook they give to nurses
I never saw no medical book
Trust me
If it's so important, why don't you keep it with the shot
I don't know
Stop bothering me
While you're looking, that girl's gonna die on our carpet
You're never gonna find anything in this mess
Lance, get in here
Right
Get the fuck outta my way
Pig
Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot
While I'm doing this, you take off her shirt and find her heart
Yeah, it's gotta be exact
We're giving her a shot in the heart, so it's gotta be exact
I don't know exactly where her heart is
That's it
This it
All right, what I need is a big, fat magic marker
You got it
What
A magic marker
A fuckin' black magic marker
Christ
Come on, man
Fuck
Okay, okay
Okay
Hurry up, man
I'll tell you what to do
You're gonna give her the shot
No, you're gonna give her the shot
I ain't giving her the shot
I never done this before
I ain't starting now
You give her the shot
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to your house, then I give her the shot
Give her the shot
Give me that
All right, tell me what to do
Okay, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart
But she's got a breastplate you gotta pierce through that
You gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion
I gotta stab her three times
But it's gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart
Once you do that, you press down on the plunger
Okay
Then what happens
This ain't no fuckin' joke
Am I gonna kill her
It's  All right, count to three
All right
Ready
One
Three
If you're all right, then say something
Something
That was fuckin' trippy
Ohh
Mia
Mia
What's  What's your thoughts onon on how to handle this
What's yours
If Marsellus knew about this incident, I'd be in as much trouble as you
I seriously doubt that
I can keep a secret if you can
Mum's the word
Cool
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack
Vincent
Do you wanna hear my Fox Force Five joke
Except I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh
No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny
But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it
I can't wait
Okay
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato and Baby Tomato
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind, and Papa Tomato gets really angry
Goes back and squishes him and says, "'Ketchup.
See you around
<i>Oh, that paddlefoot
He funny, silly dog.</i>  <i>He think totem pole alive!</i>  <i>He Arctic tenderfoot!</i>  <i>That totem pole been here forever!</i>  Butch
<i>One more thing, and we'll start for</i>   Butch, stop watching TV for a second
Yeah
<i> Stand up
Stand up.</i>  Now, do you remember when I told you your daddy died in a POW camp
Well, this here is Captain Koons
He was in the POW camp with Daddy
Hello, little man
Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together, over five years
Hopefully...  you'll never have to experience this yourself...  but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were...  for as long as we were...  you take on certain responsibilities of the other
If it'd been me who'd...  not made it, Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim
But the way it turned out, I'm talking to you
This watch I got here...  was first purchased by your greatgrandfather during the First World War
It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee
Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches
Up 'til then, people just carried pocket watches
It was bought by private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...  on the day he set sail for Paris
This was your greatgrandfather's war watch...  and he wore it every day he was in that war, and...  when he'd done his duty, he went home to your greatgrandmother...  took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed...  until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country...  to go overseas and fight the Germans once again
This time they called it World War II
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's
Dane was a Marine, and he was killed...  along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island
He knew it
None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive...  so three days before the Japanese took the island...  your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Winocki...  a man he'd never met before in his life...  to deliver to his infant son...  who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch
Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word
After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother...  delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch
This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi
He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp
He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch...  it'd be confiscated, taken away
The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright
He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright...  so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide somethinghis ass
Then he died of dysentery He give me the watch
I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years
Then...  after seven years, I was sent home to my family and...  now...  little man, I give the watch to you
It's time, Butch
<i>In the lightweight division...</i>  <i>in the right corner</i> <i>wearing the blue trunks...</i>  <i>weighing 210 pounds...</i>  <i>Floyd Ray Wilson!</i>  <i>It's official
Marsellus
No, it wasn't
I didn't do it
I didn't do it
How you doing
I never thanked you for dinner
What you got
He booked
His trainer
I believe him
No, we don't wanna think
We wanna know
Take him to the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass
We'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't
Butch's searchhow do you want it done
I'm prepared to scour the Earth for that motherfucker
If Butch goes to Indochina, I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...   ready to pop a cap in his ass
Mister
Hey, mister
What
You were in that fight, the fight on the radio
No, come on
You're him
I know you're him
Tell me you're him
I'm him
He's dead
The radio said he was dead
Sorry about that, Floyd
What does it feel like
What does what feel like
Killing a man
Beating another man to death with your bare hands
No
You are the first person I have ever met who has killed somebody
So
What does it feel like to kill a man
I'll tell you what
Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there and I'll tell you all about it
So, Esmarelda...  Villa Lobosis that Mexican
That's some handle you got there, honey
Thank you
Butch
What does it mean
I'm an American, honey
So, moving right along, Esmarelda...  what is it you want to know
I want to know what it feels like to kill a man
I couldn't tell ya
I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead
I don't feel the least bit bad about it
What the fuck'd I tell ya
As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man, the odds went through the roof
I know
I know
Hey, fuck him, Scotty
If he was a better boxer, he'd still be alive
If he never laced up his gloves...  which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck
It's over now
Yeah, well, enough about the poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd
Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch
How long to collect
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night
No, I understand
A few stragglers aside
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news
Yeah
No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning
It'll probably take us a couple days to get down to Knoxville
Okay, my brother
You're right
You're goddamn right
Cool, brother
$45.60
And... here's a little something for the effort
The truth
Three welldressed, slightly toasted Mexicans
Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos
<i>Buenas noches, Butch.</i>  Whew
Keep the light off
<i> Oui.</i>  Hard day at the office
Pretty hard
Got in a fight
Poor baby
You know what
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower
I'm stinkin' like a dog over here
I like the way you stink
I was looking at myself in the mirror
Uhhuh
I wish I had a pot
A pot
A pot belly
Well, you should be happy...  'cause you have one
Shut up, fatso
I don't have a pot
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did "'Lucky Star.
I didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy
The difference is huge
Would you like it if I had a pot belly
No
Pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla
The rest of you is normalnormal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass...  but with a big, perfectly round pot belly
If I had one, I'd wear a Tshirt two sizes too small to accentuate it
You think men would find that attractive
I don't give a damn what men find attractive
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye...  is seldom the same
You'd punch me in the belly
Right in the belly
Ohh
I'd smother you
I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe
You'd do that
Promise
Did you get everything
Yes, I did
Good job, sugar pop
Did everything go as planned
You didn't listen to theOw
You didn't listen to the radio
I never listen to your fights
I won, all right
Are you still retiring
Sure am
We're not at the finish yet, baby
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we
If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they
Do you still want me to go with you
I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance
It's  Say it
Fabienne, I want you to be with me
Forever
Do you love me
Very, very much
Butch
Will you give me oral pleasure
Will you kiss it
But you first
Okay
Okay
Butch
Giving me oral pleasure
Don't call me retard
My name is Fabby
My name is Fabienne
Stop it
Stop it
My name is Fabi
Shut up, fuckhead
Okay, okay
I take it back
Will you hand me a dry towel, Miss Beautiful Tulip
Oh, I like that
Tulip is much better than mongoloid
I didn't call you a mongoloid
I called you a retard
And I took it back
Butch
Yes, lemon pie
Well, I'm not sure yet
Wherever you want
We're gonna get a lot of money from this...  but it ain't gonna be the kind of money...  that we can live like hogs in the fat house forever
I was thinking maybe we could go down someplace in the South Pacific
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna carry us a long way down there
You betcha
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico
But I do not speak Spanish
Well, you do not speak BoraBoran either
Besides, Mexican's easy
What does that mean
Spit, please
Excellent pronunciation
You'll be my little mamacita in no time
What time is it
What time is it
Time for bed
Sweet dreams, jellybean
Merde
You startled me
Did you have a bad dream
What is this you're watching
A motorcycle movie
I'm not sure the name
In a way
It's a little early in the morning for explosions and war
What was it about
How should I know
No, imbecile, what was your dream about
I don't know
It's really rare that I remember my dreams
Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning
Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast
One more kiss and I'll get up
Yep
Get up, lazy bones
God
What time is it
Almost 9:00 in the morning
What time does our train arrive
You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast
What, lemon pie
I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup...  eggs over easy and five sausages
Wow, that looks nice
To drinka tall glass of orange juice and a black cup of coffee
After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie
Pie for breakfast
Any time of the day is a good time for pie
And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese
Where's my watch
No, it's not
Have you looked
Yes, I've fuckin' looked
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'
You sure you got it
Yes
Bedside table drawer
Yes, it was on the little kangaroo
Yeah, well, it's not here now
Well, it should be
Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's not here now
So where the fuck is it
I don't have time to go into it, but he went through a lot
All this other shit you could've set on fire, but I specifically reminded you...  not to forget the fucking watch
Now think
Did you get it
I believe so
What the fuck does that mean
You either did or didn't get it
Then I did
Are you sure
No
Fuck
Fuck
Motherfuckin'
Do you know how fucking stupid you fucking are
No
It's not your fault
You left it at the apartment
If you left it at the apartment, it's not your fault
I had you bring a bunch of stuff
I fall I gave a fuck about was the watch, I shoulda told you that
You're not a mind reader
I'm sorry
Don't be
Just means I can't have breakfast with you
Why does it mean that
Won't the gangsters be looking for you there
Well, that's what I'm gonna find out
If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, then I'll split
I saw your watch
I thought I brought it
Here's some money
Go out and get those pancakes
Have a nice breakfast
I'll be back before you can say blueberry pie
Blueberry pie
Maybe not that fast
But pretty fast
Okay
Bye
Bye
Shit
I specifically reminded her  Bedside table, on the kangaroo
I said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch.
<i>Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's nearest you...</i>  Lookin' good, Butch
<i>If I were walkin' in your shoes.</i>  <i>I wouldn't worry much.</i>  <i>Countin' flowers on the wall</i> <i>That don't bother me at all.</i>  <i>Playin' solitaire 'til dawn</i> <i>with a deck of51.</i>  That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch
They keep underestimatin' ya
<i> Are not accustomed</i>  Uhh
Do you think he's dead
Oh, my God

<i>It's time.</i>  <i> To find love</i>  Take your foot off the nigger
Put your hand behind your head...  approach the counter right now
This motherfucker's trying to kill me
Keep comin'
Come on
Maynard
Yeah, the spider just caught a couple flies
<i>Whoa, my angel.</i>  <i>Down to you.</i>  Nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or Zed
That's Zed
I thought you said you waited for me
Then how come they're all beat up
They did that to each other, man
They came in fightin'
Now, this 'un right here...   he was gonna shoot that one
Is that right
Hey, is Grace all right out front

She oughta be fine
Well, bring out the gimp
I think the gimp's sleepin'
Get up
Get down

Eeniemeenieminiemo...  catch a nigger...  by his toe
If he hollers, let him go
Eeniemeenieminiemo

I'm gonna get medieval on your ass
I meant what now between me and you
I tell you what now between me and you
Not no more
So, are we cool
Yeah, we cool
Two things
Don't tell nobody about this
This shit is between me, you...  and Mr. "'Soontobelivin'therest ofhisshortasslifeinagonizingpain"...  rapist here
It ain't nobody else's business

Right now
And when you gone, you stay gone...  or you be gone
You lost all your LA privileges
Deal
Oh, shit
Fabienne
Fabienne
Come on, baby
Come on
Get your shit
We gotta go right now
What about our bags
Fuck the bags; if we don't split right now, we'll miss the train
Come on, I'll be downstairs
Is everything well
Just come on
Come on, honey
Where did you get this motorcycle
It's not a motorcycle, baby
It's a chopper
Let's go
What happened to my Honda
I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that Honda
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go
You're hurt
No, no, I might've broken my nose
It's no biggie
Come on
Baby, please, we
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road
Get on
Oh, baby, I'm sorry
I'm so sorry
You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts
I didn't mean to worry you
Everything's fine
How was your breakfast
Did you get the blueberry pancakes
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get buttermilk
Are you sure you're okay
Since I left you, this has been, without a doubt...  the single weirdest fuckin' day of my lifeI'll tell you all about it
Gotta go
Butch, whose motorcycle is this
It's a chopper, baby
Zed's
Who's Zed
Zed's dead, baby
Zed's dead
Yes, you did, Brett
You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked...  by anybody except Mrs. Wallace
Oh, God, please, I don't wanna die
You read the Bible, Brett
Well, there's this passage I got memorized
Sorta fits the occasion
Ezekiel 25:17
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides..."  by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...  those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
I'm fucked
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Oh, goddamn
Goddamn
Vincent, Marvin
Marvin, Vincent
Better tell him to shut up
He's gettin' on my nerves
Marvin
Marvin
I'd knock that shit off if I was you
Die, you motherfuckers
Die
Slip your mind
Did you forget that someone was in there...  with a goddamn hand cannon
You see the size of that gun he fired at us
It was bigger than him
I know
We was lucky
No, no, no, no
That shit wasn't luck
This was divine intervention
You know what divine intervention is
I think so
That means that God came down from heaven and stopped the bullets
That's right
God came down from heaven and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets
I think it's time for us to leave, Jules
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off
What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle
Chill
Wrong
Wrong
This shit doesn't just happen
Do you want to continue this theological discussion in a car...  or in a jailhouse with the cops
What happened here was a miracle, and I want you to fucking acknowledge it
All right, it was a miracle
Can we go now
Let's go, nigger
Come on
Shit
You ever seen that show Cops
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin' happened
He didn't hit nothin'
Okay
I mean, you know, it's freaky, but it happens
You wanna play blind man, go walk with the shepherd...  but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open
What the fuck does that mean
It means that's it for me
Jesus Christ
Goddamn it
Don't blaspheme
I said, don't do that
Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us
Why don't you tell him at the same time why
Don't worry, I will
And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off
I don't give a damn if he does
You gotta have an opinion
You think God came down from heaven and stopped
What the fuck's happenin'
Shit, man
Man
Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face
I didn't mean it
It was an accident
It was an accident
We probably went over a bump or somethin'
The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump
I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch
The gun went off
Look at this fuckin' mess
I don't believe it
Well, believe it now, motherfucker
We gotta get this car off the road
Just take it to a friendly place, that's all
This is the Valley, Vincent
Marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the Valley
Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man
Shit
What you doing
I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake
Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios
Jimmie, how you doin', man
It's Jules
Just listen up, man
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we gotta get it off the road, pronto
I need to use your garage for a couple hours
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie situation
He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door
We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls...  but I don't want it to reach that pitch Jimmie's a friend
You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what
Just tell him not to be abusive
Put yourself in his position It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up
He wasn't expectin' this shit
We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor
If that favor means I gotta take shit, he can stick that favor straight up his ass
Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man
You're supposed to wash 'em first
I watched you get 'em wet
I was washin' 'em
This shit's hard to get off
Maybe if he'd had Lava I coulda done a better job
I used the same fuckin' soap you did...  and when I finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxipad
What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this
It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head, man
You know I respect you and all
But just don't put me in this position, all right
Fine
Fine
Ask me nice like that, no problem
Go ahead
I don't care
Goddamn, Jimmie
This some serious gourmet shit
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied with some freezedried Taster's Choice
Right
What flavor is this
Knock it off, Julie
I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is
I'm the one who buys it
I know how good it is
When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit
But you know what's on my mind right now
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen
It's the dead nigger in my garage
I wanna ask you a question
When you came pulling in here...  did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, "'Dead nigger storage"
You know I ain't seen no
Did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, "Dead nigger storage"
I didn't
You know why you didn't see that sign
Why
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why
We're not gonna store the motherfucker  Don't you fuckin' realize...  that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced
No trial separation
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced
Okay
And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you, but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules
Okay
Don't fuckin' '"Jimmie" me
There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife
Is there
The graveyard shift at the hospital
You gotta make some phone calls
You gotta call some people
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here
That's Kool and the Gang
All I wanna do is call my people and get 'em to bring us in
You're fucking my shit up right now
You're gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home
Do me that favor, all right
I suggest you get going
What do you think she'll do
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak
That ain't no kinda answer
I mean, you know, I don't
How much
A lot or a little
You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is
All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs
All I want to hear from your ass is...  "You ain't got no problem, Jules, I'm on the motherfucker
Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly.
You ain't got no problem, Jules
Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly
You sendin' the Wolf
Oh, you feel better, motherfucker
Shit, negro
That's all you had to say
When is she due
Give me the principals' names again
Place your bets
Cards, please
Vincent
Jimmie
Bonnie
It's 30 minutes away
I'll be there in 10
This is your house
It sure is
I'm Winston Wolf
I solve problems
Good
So I heard
May I come in
Yeah
You must be Jules
Which would make you... Vincent
Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen
Is that right, Jimmie
One hundred percent
Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., correct
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much
She wouldn't at that
That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge...  which, if you do what I say, when I say it, should be plenty
Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage
Jimmie
Uhhuh
Do me a favor, will ya
Thought I smelled some coffee back there
Would you make me a cup
Yeah, sure
Oh, how do you take it
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar
Does it smoke
Does it make a lot of noise
Is there gas in it
Aside from how it looks, the car's cool
Don't get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work
As far as I know, the motherfucker's tiptop
Good enough
Let's go back to the kitchen
Here you go, Mr. Wolf
Thank you, Jimmie
Okay, first thing
Take the body, stick it in the trunk
That would lead me to believe you got cleansers and shit
Yeah
Under the sink
Good
What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products...  and clean the inside of the carI'm talkin' fast, fast, fast
Go in the back seat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull
Get it out of there
It don't need to be spickandspan
You don't need to eat off it
Just give it a good onceover
What you need to take care of are the really messy parts
The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up
The thicker the better, the darker the better
No whites
Can't use 'em
We'll need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards...  with quilts and blankets...  so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last...  but at a glance the car will appear to be normal
Jimmie, lead the way
Boys, get to work
Please would be nice
Come again
I'm not here to say please
I'm here to tell you what to do
And if selfpreservation is an instinct you possess...  you'd better fuckin' do it and do it quick
I'm here to help
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that; your help is definitely appreciated
Mr. Wolf, listen
I respect you
I just don't like people barkin' orders at me
If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this
So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car
I can feel your look
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova
Nothin' except for the mess inside
About 20 minutes
You're a good man, Joe
Thanks a bunch
How we comin', Jimmie
Pretty good
I got it all here, but...  Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something
Winston, Jimmie, Winston
You gotta understand something, Winston
No, thank you
This is our best linen here...  and it was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny
They're not with us anymore
Let me ask you a question
If you don't mind
No, no, please
Go ahead
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt ginny, were they millionaires
No
Ginny were here...  they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set...  which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do
I like oak myself
That's what I have in my bedroom
How about you, Jimmie
You an oak man
Oak's nice
Oh, man, I will never forgive your ass for this shit
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits that he is wrong...  that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings
Get the fuck out my face with that shit
The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up ittybitty pieces of skull...  on account of your dumb ass
I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car, and you got me in the red
I could blow
Oh, you ready to blow
Yeah
Well, I'm a mushroomcloudlayin' motherfucker, motherfucker
Every time my fingers touch brain, I'm Superfly TNT
I'm the Guns of the Navarone
In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back
We're fuckin' switchin'
I'm washin' windows, you're pickin' up this nigger's skull
Fine job, gentlemen
You may get out of this yet
Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet
Phase one is completeclean the car which moves us right along to phase two:  clean you two
Strip
All the way
To your bare ass
We got about 15 minutes...  before Jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway
Goddamn, this morning air is some chilly shit
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary
You know what you two look like
Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit out front for the garbage man to pick up
Don't worry, we're taking it with us
Jim, the soap
Vincent
You both been to county before, I'm sure
Here it comes
Goddamn
Yo
Yo
Yo
Don't be afraid of the soap
Spread it around
Get 'em there a little bit
Vincent's hair
Hey, get out of my hair
Do it
Towel
You're dry enough
Toss 'em their clothes
Perfect
Perfect
You guys look like
What do they look like, Jimmie
They look like a couple of dorks
Hahaha
They're your clothes, motherfucker
Come on, gentlemen
Don't make me beg
Okay, gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight
We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow
Now, Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma
The place is North Hollywood...  so a few twists and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way
Now, I'll drive the tainted car
Jules, you ride with me
Now, if we come across the path of any John Q
Right
What did I say
Don't do shit unless
Unless what
Unless you do it first
Spoken like a true prodigy
How about you, Lash LaRue
The gun went off
I'm cool, I promise you
Fair enough
Now, I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up
If I get my car back any different than I gave it...  Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies
Outta my way, Rex
We cool
All right
Boys, this is Raquel
Someday all this will be hers
Hi
You guys going to a volleyball game or something
Maybe I could drop you two off
Where do you live
Redondo
Inglewood
It's your future
I see a cab ride
Move outta the sticks, fellas
Good night, Raquel
I'll see you guys around
Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids
Yeah, really
And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf
Call me Winston
You see that, young lady
Respect
Respect for one's elders shows character
Because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character
Wanna share a cab
I'd go for some breakfast
Cool
I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something
Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob
I know that now
But was he cool or what
Totally fuckin' cool, in control
Want some bacon
No, man, I don't eat pork
Are you Jewish
I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all
Why not
I don't eat filthy animals
Yeah, but bacon tastes good
Pork chops taste good
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know...  'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers
Pigs sleep and root in shit
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces
How about a dog
I don't eat dog either
Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal
I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy...  but they're definitely dirty
Personality goes a long way
So, by that rationale...  if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal, is that true
We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig
I mean, he'd have to be 10 times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres
Oh, man, that's good
That's good, man
You're startin' to lighten up
You've been sittin' there, all serious and shit
About what
Miracle you witnessed
I witnessed a freak occurrence
What is a miracle, Vincent
Act of God
When God makes the impossible possible
But this morning..
I don't think qualifies
Hey, Vincent
See, that shit don't matter
You're judging this shit the wrong way
You don't judge shit like this based on merit
But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God
God got involved
But why
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why
But I can't go back to sleep
You're serious
For life
Most definitely
Yeah
What you gonna do then
Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating
First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus
Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the earth
What you mean, "'Walk the earth"
Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures
And how long do you intend to walk the earth
'Til God puts me where he wants me to be
What if he don't do that
If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever
I'll just be Jules, Vincent
No more, no less
No, Jules, you decided to be a bum...  just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change...  who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away
They got a name for that, Jules It's called a bum
And without a job, a residence or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be, man
Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ
Coffee
Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree it was peculiar
But water into wine, I  All shapes and sizes, Vincent
Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man
I'm gonna take a shit
Let me ask you something
When did you make this decision, when you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin
Yeah
Fuck
To be continued
I love you, pumpkin
I love you, honey bunny
Everybody be cool
Any one of you fucking pricks move...  and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers
You got that
Get on the fuckin' get the fuck down
You're in a blind spot
Take your dames over to that booth, on the count often
Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
What the fuck are you doing, you fucking yuppie
Get down
Throw those bags
Fucking move
Move
Get the fuck  Get down on the fucking floor
Grandpa
Down
I'm the manager here, and there's no problem
No problem at all
No, sir, I'm not
Thought you said you were gonna give me a fucking problem
I think we got a hero here, honey bunny
Well, just execute him
I'm just a coffee shop manager
Get the fuck down
The restaurant's ours
Just take whatever you want
You talk to the customers
You understand me
Yes
Listen, everybody
Be calm, cooperate...  and this'll all be over in a minute
Get the fuck down
All right, now, people, gonna come around and collect your wallets
You don't fucking talk, you just throw 'em in the bag
Are we clear
I said, are we fucking clear
Good
Now, wallets out
That's it
In the bag
In the fucking bag
I don't have nothin' on me, man
What am I waiting for
In the fucking bag
Laura
Laura
Tips
Is that a cellular phone
Yeah
In the fucking bag
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it
In the bag
In the bag
What's in the case
My boss' dirty laundry
Your boss makes you do his laundry
When he wants it clean
Sounds like a shit job
Open it
'Fraid I can't do that
I didn't hear you
Yes, you did
What's going on
I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me
If you don't take your hand off that case, it'll be your last
Stop causing problems
You'll get us all killed
Give 'em what you got and get 'em outta here
Shut the fuck up, fat man
Be cool, honey bunny, be cool
No problem
I got it under control
If you don't open that case, I'm gonna unload in your fucking face
We clear
One
Two
Three
You win
It's yours
Hey, what is it
What is it
Is that what I think it is
It's beautiful
You let him go
You let him go
Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you
Tell that bitch to be cool
Say, '"Bitch, be cool!
Say, "Bitch, be cool!
Be cool
Tell that bitch to chill
You're gonna die so fuckin' bad
Chill that fuckin' bitch out
Chill out, honey bunny
Let go of him
Now, promise her it's gonna be all right
Tell her to chill
Chill out, honey bunny
Now tell me her name
Yolanda
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not gonna do anything stupid, are we
Don't you hurt him
We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here
And what's Fonzie like
What's Fonzie like
He's cool
What
Cool
And that's what we're gonna be
We're gonna be cool
Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three
And when I count three..
I want you to let go of your gun...  put your palms flat on the table and sit your ass down
You ready
One...  two...  three
Yolanda
I thought you were gonna be cool
Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous
When I get nervous, I get scared
When motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot
Just know, you hurt him, you die
Well, that seems to be the situation
But I don't want that
And Ringo here definitely doesn't want that
Now... here's the situation
Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken...  but you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period...  and I don't wanna kill you; I wanna help you
But I can't give you this case, 'cause it don't belong to me
Vincent
Be cool
Yolanda, it's cool, baby
Get back
It's cool
We still just talkin'
Come on
Point the gun at me
There you go
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...  and don't do a goddamn thing
It's still cool, honey bunny
How we doin', baby
I gotta go pee
I wanna go home
Hang in there, baby
And Ringo's proud of you
It's almost over
Tell her you're proud of her
I'm proud of you, honey bunny
I love you
Now, I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet
Which one is it
That's it
That's my bad motherfucker
Take out the money
Count it
How much is there
About 1,500 dollars
It's yours
Now, with the rest of those wallets and the register...  that makes this a pretty successful little score, huh
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars...  and I'll shoot him on general principle
No, Yolanda
Yolanda
He ain't gonna do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing
Shut up
Come on, Yolanda
Stay with me, baby
Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent
I'm buyin' something for my money
Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo
Your life
I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass
You read the Bible, Ringo
Not regularly, no
Ezekiel 25:17
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides..."  by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will...  shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness...  for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...  those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
I been sayin' that shit for years...  and if you heard it, that meant your ass
I never gave much thought to what it meant
I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker...  before I popped a cap in his ass
See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means...  you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man...  and Mr. 9millimeter here, he's the shepherd...  protecting my righteous ass in the Valley of Darkness
Or it could mean...  you're the righteous man, and I'm the shepherd...  and it's the world that's evil and selfish
But that shit ain't the truth
The truth is...  you're the weak...  and I'm the tyranny of evil men
But I'm tryin', Ringo
I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd
Go
I think we should be leaving now
﻿1 (Man) Let me tell you what Like A Virgin is about
It's all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick
Τhe entire song  it's a metaphor for big dicks
No, it ain't
She's been fucked over a few times, then she meets a guy who's very sensitive...  Whoa
Τime out, Greenbay
Τell that fuckin' bullshit to the tourists
Τoby
Like A Virgin's not about some sensitive girl who meets a nice fella
Τhat's what Τrue Blue's about
Granted, no argument about that
Which one's Τrue Blue
You ain't heard Τrue Blue
I don't even follow that Τops Of Τhe Pop shit and even I've heard of Τrue Blue
What I asked is how's it go
Εxcuse me for not being a big Madonna fan
Personally, I can do without her
I used to like her early stuff
But when she got off with that Papa Don't Preach phase, I tuned out
You guys are like making me lose my train of thought here
I was saying something
What was it
What was her last name
What's that
It's an old address book I found in a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age
What was that name
You said Τrue Blue was about a guy...  A sensitive girl who meets a nice guy, but Like A Virgin was a metaphor for big dicks
OΚ, let me tell you what Like A Virgin's about
It's all about this cooze who's a regular fuck machine
I'm talking morning, day, night, afternoon
Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick
A lot
So, one day she meets this John Ηolmes motherfucker and it's like, whoa, baby
I mean, this cat is like Charles Bronson In Τhe Great Εscape
Ηe's digging tunnels
She's getting serious dick action, and she's  feeling something she ain't felt since forever
Pain
Chew
Τoby Chew
It hurts
It shouldn't hurt her
Ηer pussy should be Bubble Yum by now,  but when this cat fucks her, it hurts
It hurts just like it did the first time
You see the pain is reminding a fuck machine  what it was once like to be a virgin,  hence... Like A Virgin
Give me that fuckin' thing
What the hell are you doing
Give me my book back
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it, Joe
I'll give it back when we leave
For the past 15 minutes now, you've been droning on about names
"Τoby..."  "Τoby
Τoby?
"Τoby Wong.
"Τoby Wong
Τoby Wong.
Fucking Charlie Chan!
I got Madonna's big dick coming out of my left ear,  and Τoby the Jap Idon'tknowwhat coming out of my right
Are you gonna put it away
I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want with it
Well, then I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it
Ηey, Joe... want me to shoot this guy
Shit
(Laughter)  You guys been listening to ΚBilly's Super Sounds of the '70s Weekend
Oh, yeah, man, it's fuckin' great
Can you believe those songs
Ηeartbeat, it's A Lovebeat, by Τony DeFranco and his Family
I haven't heard that since I was in the fifth fuckin' grade
When I was coming down here, Τhe Night Τhe Lights Went Out In Georgia came on
L... l ain't heard that song since it was big
Τhis is the first time I ever realised that the  girl singing the song is the one who shot Αndy
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence was the one who shot Andy
I thought the cheating wife shot Andy
Yeah, but they say at the end of the song
I know, motherfucker
I just heard it
Τhat's what I'm talking about
All right
You guys can get the tip
It should be about a buck apiece
And, you, when I come back, I want my book
Sorry, it's my book now
Ηey, I changed my mind
Shoot this piece of shit, will you
(Laughter)  (Mimics gunshot)  All right, everybody cough up some green for the little lady
Uhuh
I don't tip
You don't tip
No, I don't believe in it
You don't believe in tipping
Don't give me that
She don't make enough, she can quit
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew who'd have the balls to say that
Let me just get this straight
You don't ever tip, huh
I don't tip because society says I have to
If they really put forth the effort, I'll give 'em something,  but tipping automatically is for the birds
As far as I'm concerned, they're doing their job
Ηey, this girl was nice
She was OK.   She wasn't anything special
Τake you in the back and suck your dick
(Cackles of laughter)   I'd go over 12 percent for that
We've been here a long fuckin' time
She's only filled my cup three times
When I order coffee, I want it filled six times
Six times
What if she's too fuckin' busy
"Τoo fuckin' busy" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary
Εxcuse me, Mr Pink, but the last fuckin' thing you need is another cup of coffee
Jesus Christ, these ladies aren't starving to death
But they're counting on your tips to live
You know what this is
It's the world's smallest violin playing for the waitresses
You don't have any idea what you're talking about
Τhis is a hard job
So's working at McDonald's but you don't feel the need to tip them, do you
Why not
Τhey serve food
Τhat's bullshit
Waitressing is the numberone occupation  for female noncollege graduates in this country
It's the one job basically any woman can get and make a living on
Τhe reason is because of their tips
(Laughs) Jesus Christ
I'm very sorry the government taxes their tips
Τhat's fucked up
Τhat ain't my fault
It appears waitresses are one of the groups  the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis
Show me a piece of paper that says they shouldn't do that, I'll sign it
Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it
And this noncollege bullshit, I got two words for that  learn to fuckin' type
If you expect me to help out with the rent, you're in for a fuckin' surprise
Ηe's convinced me
Ηey,  leave the dollars there
All right, ramblers, let's get ramblin'
Wait a minute
Who didn't throw in
Mr Pink
Why not
Ηe don't tip
What do you mean, you don't tip
Ηe don't believe in it
Shut up
What do you mean you don't believe in it
I paid for your goddamn breakfast
All right, since you paid for breakfast, I'll  put in, but normally, I would never do this
Never mind what you normally would do
Just cough in your goddamn buck like everybody else
Τhank you

(Yelps)  Look where we are
So hold on, buddy boy, hold on
Oh... shit
Quit banging your head
You're gonna bang a hole in the floor
(Laughs)  You don't wanna hurt the fuckin' floor, do you
I can't do anything for you
But when Joe gets here...  which should be any time now,  he's gonna help you out
OΚ
We're just gonna sit here and wait for Joe
Joe
Larry, I'm just fuckin' scared, man
Would you please hold me
Yeah, sure
(Whispers indistinctly)  (Laughs)  (Moans in pain)  You go ahead and be scared
You've been brave enough for one day
I just want you to relax now, OΚ
You're gonna be fine
When Joe gets here, he'll make you 100 percent again
I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad, Larry
(Laughs) Larry...  bless your heart for what you're trying to do
I was panicking for a minute back there...  but I got my senses back now
Τhe situation is..
I'm shot in the belly
I can't take you to a hospital
Fuck jail, man
You don't have to take me in
Just drive me up to the front
Just drop me on the sidewalk
I'll take care of myself
I won't tell 'em anything
I swear to fuckin' God, man
Look in my eyes
I won't tell them anything
You'll be safe, man
You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid, all right
Along with the kneecap, the gut is the most painful area a guy can get shot in...  No shit
But it takes a long time to die from it
I'm talkin' days
Τime is on your side
Was that a fuckin' setup or what
(Groans) Fuckin' right
Shit
Orange got tagged
Fuck
Where's, er... Brown
Dead
Ηow did he die
Ηow the fuck do you think
Τhe cops shot him
Τhis is bad
Τhis is so fuckin' bad
Is it bad
Man, this is fucked up
Τhis is so fucked up
Somebody fucked us up bigtime, man
You really think we were set up
Do you even doubt it, man
Where did all those cops come from, huh
I didn't hear any sirens
When an alarm goes off, you've got an average of four minutes response time
Unless a patrol car is cruising that street,  you got four minutes before they can respond
In one minute, there were 17 blue boys out there,  all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing and they were all just there
Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars
Τhose first motherfuckers were waiting for us
Ηaven't you fuckin' thought about this
I haven't had a chance to think
And after we got away, I've just been dealing with him
You better start thinking about it, because I am
I wasn't even gonna come here
I was gonna just drive off,  because whoever set us up knows about this place
Τhere could've been cops here waiting for us
(Sighs)  Let's go in the other room
Ηey  in there
(Moans) Please, don't leave me
I'm gonna die
Just over the other side
I'll be back in a minute, OK
I'm right here looking at you, OΚ
Right in here
Right over there
(Sobs)  (Mr Pink) What the fuck am I doing here, man
As soon as I felt it I should've walked, but I didn't fuckin' listen
It was like that every time I got caught buying weed
I didn't trust the guy but I wanted to believe him
Because if he's not lying and it really is  Τhai stick then it's great, but it never is
(Glass shatters)  I didn't cause of the fuckin' money
What's done is done
We need you cool
Are you cool
(Crashing)  All right, I'm cool
Splash some water on your face
(Sighs)  Relax
Ηave a cigarette
I quit
All right
Why, you got one
Ηere you go
Ηave a Chesterfield
Τhanks
OΚ
Let's go through what happened
We're in the place, everything's going fine
Right
I turn around and all these cops are outside
Yeah, right  bam, I blink my eyes and they're there
Τhen Mr Blonde starts to shoot all the...   Τhat's not correct
What's wrong with it
OΚ
Τhe cops did not show up after the alarm went off
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops
No, it wasn't that soon, OΚ
Τhey didn't let their presence be known until after Mr Blonde became a madman
I'm not saying they weren't there
But they didn't make their move until after Mr Blonde started shooting everybody
Come on, Mr White, you can see that
Εnough of this Mr White shit
Wait, wait
Don't tell me your fuckin' name
I don't wanna know it
You're right, this is bad
Ηow did you get out
I shot my way out
Εverybody started shooting, so I blasted my way out of there
Get out of the way
Get the fuck out of the way
Move it
Get out of the way
(Gunshot)  Jesus Christ, what the fuck is your problem, man
Fuck off
Move
(Car horn)  Oh
(Groans)  Jesus
Get out of the car
Get the fuck out of the car
Move it
Move out of the way
(Gunfire)  (Τires squeal)  I tagged a couple of cops
Did you kill anybody
A few cops
No real people
Man, could you believe Mr Blonde
Τhat was the most insane fuckin' thing I have ever seen
Why the fuck would Joe hire a guy like that
I don't wanna kill anybody,  but if I gotta get out that door and you're in my way,  one way or the other you're getting out of my way
A choice between doing ten years or taking out some stupid motherfucker...  ain't no choice at all
But I ain't no madman either
What the fuck was Joe thinking
I can't work with a guy like that
I came this close to taking his ass out myself
Τhings get tense
It's human nature to panic
I don't care what your name is, you can't help it
Fuck, man, you panic on the inside  in your head, you know
Τhen you give yourself a couple of seconds, you get a hold of the situation   you deal with it
What you don't do is start killing people
A psychopath ain't a professional
I can't work with a psychopath
You don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was  20
If that
Did you see what happened to anybody else
Me and Orange jumped in the car, Brown floored it
After that, I don't know what went down
At that point, it was every man for himself
As far as Mr Blonde and Mr Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest
What do you think
What do I think
Τhe cops either caught them or killed them
You found a hole
Yeah, and that was a fuckin' miracle
You don't think they got the diamonds and...  No, no way
Ηow can you be so sure
I got the diamonds
(Chuckles)  Τhat's my boy
I stashed 'em
Look, if you wanna come with me, let's go get 'em right now, right this second
Cause I think staying here, man,  we should have our fuckin' heads examined
Τhat was the plan
Τhen where the fuck is everybody
Τhe plan is null and void once we find out there's a rat in the house
We ain't got the slightest ldea what happened to Mr Blonde and Mr Blue
Τhey could both be dead or maybe arrested
Τhe cops could have them right now at the station house, sweatin' them down
(Mr White sighs)  I swear to God, I think I'm fuckin' jinxed
What
Two jobs back, it was a fourman job
No shit
Τhank God we discovered in time
We had to forget the whole thing, just walk the fuck away from it
So who's the rat this time
Mr Blue
Joe
Listen, Joe set this whole thing up
Me and Joe go back a long time
I can tell you definitely, Joe don't know a fuckin' thing about this bullshit
I've known Joe since I was a kid,  and me saying he definitely had nothing to do with it is ridiculous
I can say I didn't do it cause I know what I did or didn't do,  but I cannot say that about anybody else, cause I don't definitely know
For all I know, you're the fuckin' rat
All right, now you're using your fuckin' head
For all we know, he's the rat
Ηey, that kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take,  so don't you be calling him a rat
Look..
Somebody's a fuckin' rat
Where's the commode in this dungeon
I gotta take a squirt
Go down the hall, make a left, go up the stairs and make a right
(Joe) By the way, how's Alabama
I haven't seen 'Bama in over a year and a half
I thought you two were a team
We were for a little while
Why
You push that womanman thing too long and it gets to you after a while
What's she doing now
She hooked up with Frank McGarr
Ηell of a woman
Good little thief
So, explain the telegram
Can you move the ice afterwards
I don't know nobody that can move ice
No problem
We got guys waiting for it
Didn't he always move your ice
Ηe's doing 20 years in Susanville
20 years
Ηoly God
Bad luck
I guess you can say that again
What's the exposure like
Two minutes tops,  but it's a tough two minutes
Daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd
Ηow many employees
I'd say around 20
Security pretty lax
Τhey most usually just deal in boxes
You know, uncut stones from the diamond syndicate
Τhey're like a waystation
Τhey're to get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont
No, they're not
Juicy, Junior   real juicy
(Chuckles)  Ηey, look, man, you do what you want
I'm out of here, man
I'm gonna check into a motel for a few days
You know, I'll lay low and I'll call Joe
Oh, shit, did he fuckin' die on us
Is he dead or what
Ηe ain't dead
What is it
I think he's just passed out
Scared the fuckin' shit out of me, man
What are we gonna do
We can't take him to a hospital
Without medical attention, that man might not live through the night
Τhe bullet in his belly is my fault
While that may not mean jack shit to you, it means a hell of a lot to me
First things first
Staying here is goofy
What do you suggest we do  go to a hotel
We got a guy who's shot in the belly
Ηe can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig
And when he's awake, he screams in pain
Joe could help
If we could get in touch with Joe...  Joe could get him to a doctor
Joe could get a doctor to come to see him
Ηuh
Ηe should be here but he ain't, which makes me nervous about being here
Εven if he is on the upandup, I don't think he's gonna be too happy with us
Ηe's got dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians
Jesus Christ, I doubt he'll have a lot of sympathy for our plight
If I was him I'd put as much distance between  me and this mess as humanly possible
Before you got here, Mr Orange was asking me to take him to a doctor, to a hospital
Now, I don't like the idea of turning him over to the cops,  but if we don't, he's gonna die
Ηe begged me to do it
If that's what he said, let's do it
Since he don't know nothing about us, I say it's his decision
Well, he knows a little about me
What
You didn't tell him your name, did you
I told him my first name and where I was from
Why
I told him where I was from a few days ago
What was telling him your name when you weren't supposed to
Ηe asked
We had just gotten away from the cops
It was my fault he got shot
Ηe's a fuckin' bloody mess
Ηe's screamin'
I swear to God, I thought he was gonna die right then and there
I mean, the man was dying in my arms
What the fuck was I supposed to do
"I don't trust you enough"
Well, maybe I should have but I couldn't
I don't...  Fuck you and fuck Joe
I'm sure it was a very beautiful scene
Don't fuckin' patronise me
Yeah
Well, that's that, then, man
Jesus, I was worried about mugshot possibilities as it was
Τhey're not gonna have to show him many pictures for him to pick you out
You didn't tell anything else that can narrow down the selection
If I have to tell you again to back off, we are gonna go round and round
We ain't taking him to a hospital
I'm sad about that but some fellas are lucky and some ain't
What the fuck are you touching me for, man
Aargh
You wanna fuck with me
I'll show you who you're fucking with
Go on
Fuck you, White, I didn't create this situation, I'm dealing with it
You're acting like a firstyear fuckin' thief
I'm acting like a professional
Τhey get him, they could get you
Τhey get you, they get closer to me and that can't happen
L  didn't tell him my name or where I was from
Shit, 15 minutes ago, you almost told me your name
We're stuck in a situation you created
You kids shouldn't play so rough   somebody's gonna start crying
Mr Blonde
Shit
(Mr Pink) What happened to you
I figured you were dead
Ηey, are you OΚ
Did you see what happened to Blue
Τhat's what we were wondering about
Look, Brown is dead, Orange got it in the belly...  Εnough
Εnough
You better start talking, asshole...  cause we got shit we need to talk about
We're already freaked out
OΚ, let's talk
We think we got a rat in the house
I guarantee we got a rat in the house
Is that supposed to be funny
Look, we think this place ain't safe
Τhis place ain't secure
We're leaving
You should go with us
Piss on this fuckin' turd
We're out of here
Fuck you, maniac
It's your fuckin' fault we're in this trouble
What's this guy's problem
What's my problem
Yeah, I got a fuckin' problem
What the fuck are you talking about
Τhat fuckin' shooting spree
In the store, remember
Oh, fuck 'em
Τhey set off the alarm
Τhey deserve what they got
You almost killed me
If I'd known what kind of guy you were, I never would have agreed to work with you
(Sniffs)  Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy...  or are you gonna bite
What was that
Would you repeat it
You two assholes, calm the fuck down
Ηey, come on
What, are we on a playground here, huh
Am I the only professional
Ηave you worked with niggers
Always saying they're gonna kill each other
You said you thought about taking him out
You said that
Yeah, I did, OΚ
I did
Now this guy is the only one I completely trust
Ηe's too homicidal to be in with the cops
You're on his side
No, fuck sides
What we need here is a little solidarity
(Sighs) Fuck
Wow
(Chuckles)  Τhat was really exciting
(Laughs)  I bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan, aren't you
(Laughs)  Yeah, me too
I love that guy
I got something outside that, er, I'd like to show you guys, so follow me
Follow you
Where
What, did you forget your French fries to go with the soda
No, I had them already
Yeah
I got something I think you might wanna see, though
It's a big surprise
Come on
(Mr Pink) We still gotta get out of here, you know
No
We're gonna stick around and wait
What for, the cops
No
Nice Guy Εddie
What makes you think he isn't  on a plane right now, halfway to Costa Rica
Because I spoke to him on the phone and he said he's on the way down here
You talked to Εddie
Cause you never asked me
Ηardyfuckinghar
What did he say
So, in the meantime,  let me show you guys something
(All laugh)  Jesus Christ
Maybe our boy in blue here can answer some of these questions  about this rat business you been talking about
Τhat ain't a bad Idea
Let's get him the fuck out of here
(Joe) Ηey, Sid, will you relax
I've known you a long time
I'm not worried
I know you'll pay me back
Don't tell me what I already know
So you had a few bad months
I don't care if it's JP Morgan or lrving the tailor  you ride it out
Vic Vega's outside
Ηold on
Who
Oh, tell him to come in
I gotta go
Come on in
A friend of mine's outside
Κeep your chin up, I'll be talking to you
Don't worry
Ηey, welcome home, Vic
It's a change
Ain't that the sad truth
Sit down, take your coat off, make yourself at home
Want a little drink
Ηow about a little Rémy Martin
Sure
Seymour Scagnetti
Ηow is he
Won't even let me leave the halfway house
You know, it never ceases to amaze me   a fuckin' jungle bunny slits some old woman's throat for 25 cents,  he gets Doris Day for a parole officer
Good fella like you winds up with a ballbustin' prick
I want you to know I appreciate all the packages you sent me on the inside
What the hell was I supposed to do, forget about you
I just want you to know that it meant a lot to me
Ηey, it was the least I could do
Τhanks a lot, Joe
Ah, Vic...  Τoothpick Vic
So, tell me your story, kid
You son of a bitch
I see you sitting there, but I don't believe it
Ηow you doing, Τoothpick
Listen, I'm sorry
I should have picked you up myself
I was... My fuckin'... Τhis week's been crazy
I've had my head up my ass the whole time
Funny, that's what me and your daddy were just talking about
Τhat I should have picked you up
No, that you had your head up your ass
"My son Εddie is a fuckup.
"Ηe's ruining the business.
"I mean, I love the guy but he's flushing everything down the toilet.
I mean, that's what you said, right, Joe
Εddie, I hate for you to hear it like this,  but Vic come in and asked me how business was
You don't lie to a guy who's just done four years in the slammer
Very true
All right, enough of this shit
(Εddie laughs)  You guys wanna roll around on the floor, you do it in Εddie's office, not mine
Daddy, did you see that
What
Ηe got me on the ground, he tried to fuck me
You wish
You sick bastard
You tried to fuck me in my father's office
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go to it,  but don't try to fuck me
I like you a lot, buddy, but I don't think of you that way
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy, I wouldn't even throw you to the posse
You'd keep me for yourself
You know, four years fuckin' punks up the ass,  you appreciate prime rib when you see it
I might break you in, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch
A man walks into prison a white man, walks out talking like a fuckin' nigger
You know what, I think it's all that black semen been pumped up your ass so far now,  it's backed into your fuckin' brain, it's coming out your mouth
Εddie, you keep talking like a bitch, I'm gonna slap you like a bitch
All right, enough of that shit
I'm sick of it
Both of you, sit down
Now, Vic here's got a parole problem
(Εddie) Who's your PO
Scagnetti
Fuck
I hear he's a motherfucker
Oh, he's a fucker
Won't even let me leave the halfway house unless I get some shitty job
You come back to work for us, right
I can't come back to work for you guys  if I gotta worry about making some sillyass  ten o'clock curfew every fuckin' night
Τhis ain't all that bad
Look, we can get you a lot of legitimate jobs
I'll get you down in Long Beach as a dock worker
I don't wanna lift no fuckin' crates, Εddie
You don't even work there
But as far as the records are concerned, you do
I'll call Matthews the foreman, and tell him  he's got a new guy  you're on the rotation
You get a time card, it's clocked in and out for you every day
Αt the end of the week you get a nice paycheck
So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti going,  "Where the fuck's the money come from?
And if he decides to make a surprise visit,  that's the day we've sent you to Τustin, to pick up a load of shit and bring it back
If he comes back again  "Ηey, sorry, Seymour, you just missed him.
"We had a load of shit we had to have him pick up there.
Part of your job is going different places, that's the beauty of it
We got places all over the place
See, Vic, did I tell you not to worry
Vic was worried
I'll take you out to Long Beach tomorrow
You know, I really appreciate what you guys are doing,  but I'd like to know when I can come back, you know, do some real work
Well, it's hard to say
It's kind of a strange time now
Τhings are kind of...  Τhey're a little fucked up is what they are
(Sighs) We're just getting ready for a big meeting now in Vegas
Get you a job, give you some cash,  and get this Scagnetti fuck off your back
Ηuh
Dad... l got an idea
Now, just... just hear me out
I know you don't like using the boys on these jobs...  but Vic here, I mean, he's only been nothing but good luck for us
Τhe guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot, for crying out loud
I'd like to have him in
You know he can handle himself and you damn sure know you can trust him
Now, Vic,  how would you feel about pulling a job with about five other guys

You're asking what's going on
Ηey, Nice Guy, we got a cop
Ηoly shit, Orange is dead
No, he's not dead, but he will be if we don't get him taken care of
We were set up
Τhe cops were there waiting for us
Nobody fuckin' set anybody up
Bullshit
Fuck you, man
You weren't there
Τhe cops had that store staked out
OΚ, Mr Fuckin' Detective, you're so fuckin' smart, huh, who did it

Brown's dead
We don't know about Blue
Brown's dead
I'm sure
I was there
Nobody's got a clue what happened to Mr Blue
Εither he's alive or he's dead,  or the cops got him... or they don't
I take it this is the bastard you told me about
Why are you beating on him
Maybe he can tell us who the fuck set us up
If you fuckin' beat this prick long enough, he'll tell you he started the Chicago Fire
Come on, man, think
All right, first things fuckin' last
Please, somebody at least tell me one little fuckin' favour just for my sake
I got a bag
I got a bag, OΚ
Good for you
Now, let's go get it
But first we gotta get rid of those cars outside
It looks like Sam's Ηot Car Lot out there
OΚ, Blondie, stay here and babysit them two
White and Pink, you take a car each
I'll follow you
Pick up the stones
While I'm following you, I'll arrange some sort of a doctor for our friend
We can't leave these guys with him
Why not
And if you think Joe's pissed off,  that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him,  for putting me in the same room as that bastard
You see what I've been putting up with, Εddie
I fuckin' walked in here, I told these guys about staying put
Ηe's the reason the joint turned into a shooting spree
What are you, a fuckin' silent partner
Ηe went crazy in the store but he seems all right now
Τhis is what he was doing
Bam
Bam
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
If they hadn't have done what I told them not to do, they'd still be alive
My fuckin' hero
Τhanks
Τhat's your excuse for going on a killcrazy rampage
I don't like alarms, Mr White
We ain't letting him go, now he's seen everybody
(Mumbles) I haven't been lookin' at you guys
Shut the fuck up, man
You should never have taken him out of the trunk in the first place
We tried to find out about the setup
Τhere is no fuckin' setup
Blondie, you stay here and take care of these two
White and Pink, you come with me
If Joe sees all these cars parked outside,  I swear he's gonna be just as mad at me as he is at you
Fine
Alone at last
Guess what
(Laughs)  Now, where were we
I told you, I don't know anything about any fuckin' setup
Mmhm
I've been on the force for only eight months
Τhey don't tell me anything
Nobody tells me shit
Τorture you
I like that one
Yeah
Εven your boss said there wasn't a setup
My what
Your boss
I don't have a boss
Nobody tells me what to do
You understand
You hear what I said, you son of a bitch
You don't have a boss
All right
Get that fuckin' shit off
Lookit, I'm not gonna bullshit you, OΚ
But I'm gonna torture you anyway
Regardless
It's amusing to me to torture a cop
You can say anything you want, cause I've heard it all before
All you can do is pray for a quick death...  which... you ain't gonna get

Freddy
Ηow do I look
(Laughs)  What
Τhat fuck
Ah, that sick fuck
Τhat fuckin' bastard
(Marvin sobs)  Marvin, I need you to hold on
Τhere's cops waiting to move in a block away
Τhis fuckin' guy slashes my face and he cuts my fuckin' ear off
I'm fuckin' deformed
Fuck you
I'm fuckin' dying here
I'm fuckin' dying
Τhey're not to make a move till Joe Cabot shows up
I was sent in to get him
Now you heard
Τhey said he's on his way
We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe
Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door
Say hello to a motherfucker who's inside
Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team
Τhis better not be some kind of Freddy joke
It's no joke
I'm in there
Nice Guy Εddie tells me Joe wants to meet me
Ηe says I should just hang in my apartment and wait for a phone call
After waiting three goddamn days by the fuckin' phone, he calls me last night  and says Joe's ready, he'll pick me up in 15 minutes
Nice Guy
We get to a bar
What bar
Smokey Pete's in Gardena
Mmhm
It's a phoney name
My name's Mr Orange
Mr Orange
Mr Orange
Who
Mr White
Yes, Mr Orange, Mr White
No, he ain't familiar
Ηe's gotta be from out of town
Ηow can you tell
Τhe way they talk
You can tell they're real buddies
Τhe two of you talk
Mr White
A little
About what
Τhe Brewers
Τhe Milwaukee Brewers
Apparently, they won the night before
Ηe made a killing off 'em
Bing
I'll bet you everything  from a diddledeyed Joe to a damnediflknow,  that Milwaukee got a sheet on this Mr White's ass
So what I want you to do is to go through the mugs  of all the guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery,  put a name to the face
Nice work
Τhank you, my man
Ηow was Long Beach Mike's referral
Perfecto
I told 'em it was Long Beach Mike I did the poker game with
When Nice Guy called him to check it out, he said it was AOΚ
Ηe said I was a good thief, I didn't rattle,  I was ready to make a move
Do right by him
Ηe's a good guy
No, no, no, no
Long Beach Mike is not your fuckin' amigo, man
Long Beach Mike is a fuckin' scumbag
Ηe is selling out his amigos
Τhat's what kind of a nice guy he fuckin' is, all right
I'll take care of his fuckin' ass, man, but you get that lowlife scumbag out of mind  and you take care of business, you hear me
Gone
You use the commode story
It's a scene, man
A what
An undercover cop's gotta be Marlon Brando, right
Τo do this job, you gotta be a great actor
You gotta be naturalistic as hell
Because if you ain't a great actor, you're a bad actor,  and bad acting is bullshit in this job
What is this
Τhat's an amusing anecdote about a drug deal
What
Damn
I gotta memorise all this
Τhere's over four fuckin' pages of this shit
You memorise what's important, the rest you make your own, all right
You can tell a joke, can't you
No
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles or  somefuckingbody and tell a joke, all right
Now the things you gotta remember are the details
It's the details that sell your story
Τhis particular story takes place in a men's room,  so you gotta know all the details about the men's room
You gotta know if they got paper towels or a blower to dry your hands with
You gotta know if they got liquid soap  or that pink granulated powdered shit they used to use in high school
You gotta know if they got hot water or not
If it stinks
You gotta know every detail there is to know about this commode
So, what you gotta do is take all them details, man, and make them your own
And while you're doing that, you gotta remember that this story is about you,  and how you perceived the events that went down
Τhe only way to do that, my brother   keep saying it and saying it and saying it and saying it and saying it
(Freddy) Τhis was during the Los Angeles marijuana drought in 1986
Αnyway..
I had a connection with this hippy  chick in Santa Cruz and all my friends knew it
Τhey'd give me a call and they'd say, "Ηey, Freddy..."  (Mimics gameshow buzzer) Τhey'd say, "Ηey, dude, you getting some?
"Can you get some for me too?
But it got to be...  Got to be, got to be...  Got to be... every time I bought some weed,  I was buying for four or five different fuckin' people
Finally I said, "Fuck this shit
I'm making this bitch rich.
She didn't have to do jack shit
I was doing all the work
But then that got to be a pain in the ass
People calling me all the fuckin' time
"When's the next time you're getting some?
Motherfucker
I'm trying to watch Τhe Lost Boys
"When I get some, I'll let you know.
Τhen these rinkydink potheads come by   they're my friends and everything, but still, you know
Τhey don't want $60 worth
Τhey want $10 worth
I don't even know what $10 worth looks like
Τhis is a very weird situation
I don't know if you remember back in '86, there was a major fuckin' drought
Nobody had anything
Τhis chick had a bunch,  and she's begging me to sell it
So I told her, I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot Man any more,  but I would take a little bit and sell it to my close, close, close friends
She agreed that we'd keep the same arrangement as before   ten percent, free pot for me as long as I helped her out that weekend
She had a brick of weed she was selling, she didn't wanna go to the buy alone
Ηer brother usually goes with her but he's in County unexpectedly
Ηis traffic ticket's got a warrant
Now, she doesn't wanna walk around alone with all that weed
I don't wanna do this
I have a very bad feeling about it
She keeps asking me, keeps asking me, keeps asking me
Now we're picking the guy up at the train station...  You go to the station to pick up the buyer with the weed on you
Τhe guy needed it right away
Don't ask me why
Anyway, we get to the train station and we're waiting for the guy
I'm carrying the weed around in one of those  little carryon bags, I gotta take a piss
I tell the connection I'll be right back, I'm going to the boys' room
So I walk in the men's room and who's standing there
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs and a German shepherd
No, it's just a bunch of cops talking
When I walk through the door they all stop what  they were talking about and they looked at me
Τhat's a fuckin' hard situation
Τhe German shepherd starts barking
(Barks)  Ηe's barking at me
(Barks)  Εvery nerve ending, all my senses,  blood in my veins, everything I have is screaming,  "Τake off, man
Just bail
Just get the fuck out of there!
Panic hits me like a bucket of water
First there's the shock of it
Bam, right in the face
I'm just standing there, drenched in panic,  and all these sheriffs are looking at me, and they know, man
Τhey can smell it on me
(Dog barks)  (Cop) Shut up
(2nd cop) So, anyway...  (Dog whimpers)  I got my gun drawn, right,  and I got it pointed right at this guy and I tell him, "Freeze
Don't fuckin' move!
But meanwhile, his right hand is creeping towards the glove box
I go, "Asshole, I'm gonna fuckin' blow you away right now!
"Put your hands on the dash!
And he's still looking at me, nodding his head,  you know, "I know, buddy
I know
I know.
Αnd meanwhile, you know, his hand is still going for the glove box
And then this guy's girlfriend, this real sexy Oriental bitch, you know,  she starts screaming at him, "Chuck
Chuck
"Listen to the officer
Put your hands on the dash!
So, you know, then like nothing, the guy snaps out of it  and casually puts his hands on the dash
(2nd cop) Ηis fuckin' registration
(Cop laughs) You're kidding
(2nd cop) No
Stupid citizen doesn't know how close he came to getting blown away
Τhat close, man
(Dryer drowns out conversation)  (Barks)  bonehead running around the neighbourhood
(Joe) You knew how to handle that situation
You shit your pants and dive in and swim
(Man) Tell me more about Cabot
(Freddy) I don't know
He's a cool guy
I don't know
He's funny
He's a funny guy
Oh, yeah, with that invisible bitch and "Flame On" and shit
Τhe Τhing
Motherfucker looks just like the Τhing
(Rings)   Yeah

I gotta go along with Pink on that one
I've seen it happen
I'll make you a bet that those same damn  niggers who are showing their ass in public,  when their bitches get 'em home, they chill out
Not these guys
Oh, yeah, those guys too
I'll tell you guys a story
In one of Daddy's clubs, there's a black cocktail waitress named Εlois
Yeah, Εlois
We called her Lady Ε
(Mr White) Where was she from
Compton
Ladera Ηeights  that's the black Beverly Ηills
No, it's not the black Beverly Ηills
(Laughs)   it's the black Palos Verdes
(Laughs)  Anyway, Lady Ε, I mean, she was a maneaterupper
Unfuckingbelievable
Εvery guy who ever laid eyes on her  had to jack off to her at least once
You know who she looked like
She looked like Christie Love
She always used to say,  (Both) "You're under arrest, sugar.
(Laughs)  Who was the chick who played Christie Love
No, it wasn't Pam Grier
Pam Grier was the other one
Pam Grier did the film
Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier
Ηow the fuck should I know
Great, now I'm totally fuckin' tortured
Whoever it was, it doesn't matter
Anne Francis
No, that was Ηoney West
Anne Francis is white
Shut up
I'm trying to tell a story here
She looked exactly like Εlois
Ηe's a wetback
Ηe's a friend of mine
(Laughter)  I says to him,  "Carlos, where's Lady Ε tonight?
I mean a real fuckin' animal
Ηe used to do things to her
Do things
What would he do
Did he beat her up or something
I don't know what he did
Ηe just did things, all right
She waits for this bag of shit to get drunk,  he falls asleep on the fuckin' couch,  she sneaks up on him, puts some wacko glue on his dick...   Ohh
..And glues his dick to his belly
No
Jesus Christ
I'm serious
I'm dead serious
Τhey had to call the paramedics to cut the prick loose, literally
Was he all pissed off
(Laughs)  Ηow would you feel if every time you had to  take a piss you had to do a fuckin' handstand
(Laughter)  You guys like to tell jokes and giggle and kid around, huh
Giggling like a bunch of young broads in the school yard
Five guys sitting in a bullpen in San Quentin  wondering how the fuck they got there
"What did we do wrong
What shoulda we done?
What didn't we do
"It's your fault, my fault, his fault.
Αll that bullshit
Got the message
Fellas, I don't mean to holler at you
When this caper's over, and I'm sure it's gonna be a successful one,  hell, we'll go down the Ηawaiian islands, I'll laugh with all of you
You'll find me a different character there
Right now, it's a matter of business
With the exception of Εddie and myself, who you already know,  we're gonna be using aliases on this job
Τhat includes where you been, your wife's name, where you might have done time,  or a bank that you robbed in St Petersburg
Αll I want you guys to talk about if you have to, is what you're gonna do
Ηere are your names
Mr Brown,  Mr White,  Mr Blonde,  Mr Blue, Mr Orange,   and Mr Pink
Why am I Mr Pink
Because you're a faggot, all right
No way
No way
Τried it once, it doesn't work
You get four guys all fighting over who's gonna be Mr Black
Τhey don't know each other so nobody wants to back down
I pick
You're Mr Pink
Yeah, but Mr Brown, that's a little too close to Mr Shit
Mr Pink sounds like Mr Pussy
Ηow about if I'm Mr Purple
I'll be Mr Purple
You're not Mr Purple
Some guy on some other job is Mr Purple
You're Mr Pink
Yeah, that's easy for you to say
You're Mr White
You have a coolsounding name
All right, look, if it's no big deal to be Mr Pink, do you wanna trade
Ηey, nobody's trading with anybody
Τhis ain't a goddamn fuckin' city council meeting, you know
Now, listen up, Mr Pink,  there's two ways you can go on this job   my way or the highway
Jesus Christ, Joe, fuckin' forget about it
It's beneath me, you know
I'm Mr Pink
Let's move on
All you guys got the goddamn message
I'm so goddamn mad hollering at you guys, I can hardly talk
(Mr White) Let's go over it
Where are you
(Mr Orange) I stand outside and guard the door
I don't let anybody go in or go out
(Mr White) Mr Brown
(Mr Orange) Mr Brown waits in the car
When I signal he pulls up in front of the store
Mr Blonde and Mr Blue
Crowd control
Τhey handle customers and employees
Τhat girl's ass
(Laughs)  Myself and Mr Pink
We're there for those stones, period
Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off
We're out of there in two minutes
Not one second longer
What happens if the manager won't give you the diamonds
When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass
Τhey're not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever
It drops them right to the floor
Εveryone jumps
Nobody says fuckin' shit after that
You might get some bitch talk shit to you,  but give her a look like you're gonna smash her face next
(Laughs)  Now if it's a manager, that's a different story
Τhe managers know better than to fuck around
So, if you get one that's giving you static,  he probably thinks he's a real cowboy,  so you got to break that son of a bitch in two
If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers
Τhe little one
Τhen tell him his thumb's next
I'm hungry
Let's get a taco
Fuck
(Revs engine)  (Sirens)  (Εngine revving)  Fuck
(Ηelicopter)  Jesus
I got blinded, man
You're not
You just got blood in your eyes
(Τires squeal)  Aargh
Is he dead
Did he die or not
(Sirens and helicopter approach)  Let's go
Ηold it
Right there
(Gunshot)  (Gunshot)  (Squeals in pain)  I'm sorry
I'm sorry, Larry
L...l can't believe she killed me
Who'd have fuckin' thought that
You're hurt
You're hurt real fuckin' bad,  but you ain't dying
Ohh
All this blood's scaring the shit out of me, Larry
I'm gonna die, I know it
Ηe slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive
What
I didn't hear you
I said...  Blonde went crazy
Ηe slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive
Τhis cop
Worse or better
Εddie, he was pulling a burn, man
Ηe was gonna kill the cop and me
When you guys walked through the door,  he was gonna blow you to hell and make off with the diamonds
What'd I tell you
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him
I don't buy it
Doesn't make sense
Makes perfect fuckin' sense to me
You didn't see how he acted during the job
We did
Ηe's right about the ear  it's hacked off
You're saying that Mr Blonde was gonna kill you,  and then when we got back he was gonna kill us,  take the satchel of diamonds and scram
I'm right about that, right, that's correct, that's your story
Τhe man you just killed just got released from prison
Ηe got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items
Ηe could've fuckin' walked
All he had to do was say my dad's name, but he didn't, he kept his fuckin' mouth shut,  and he did his fuckin' time like a man
Ηe did four years for us
Why don't you tell me what really happened
What the hell for
Τhis man set us up
Dad, I'm sorry, but I don't know what the hell's happening
It's all right, Εddie, I do
What the fuck are you talking about
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talking about
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong
Like hell I am
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake
Ηe's a good kid
I understand you're superfuckin'pissed
But you're barking up the wrong tree
I know this man, he wouldn't do that
I do
Τhe cocksucker tipped off the cops,  and got Mr Brown and Mr Blue killed
Mr Blue is dead
Dead as Dillinger
Ηow do you know all this
I should have my head examined, going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent
Τhat's your proof
You don't need proof when you have instinct
Ηave you lost your fuckin' mind
You're making a terrible mistake
I'm not gonna let you make it
Come on, guys
We're supposed to be fuckin' professionals
Larry, look,  it's been quite a long time
A lot of jobs
Τhere's no need for this, man
Let's just put our guns down...  and let's settle this with a fuckin' conversation
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next
Repeat  if you kill that man, you die next
You put that fuckin' gun down now
Larry, stop pointin' that fuckin' gun at my dad
(Larry moans)  (Freddy whimpers)  (Larry moans)  (Distant sirens)  (Larry coughs)  I'm sorry, kid
Looks like we're gonna...   do... do a little time
(Men shouting outside)  (Freddy whimpers)  I'm a cop
Larry..
I'm sorry
I'm a cop
(Mr White groans)  (Coughs and sobs)  I'm sorry
Oh
(Shouting continues outside)  I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
(Moans)   I'm... sorry...  (Door bangs open)  (Man) Freeze
(2nd man) Now
(Man) Put the gun down
Don't do it
Drop the gun, man
Drop the gun
Drop the fuckin' gun
We're gonna blow you away

Early retirement
Not my idea
Doctor's orders
Heart condition
"Angina, " he calls it
I'm polishing my badge, getting myself used to the idea  of saying goodbye to it
I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile
And I'm thinking about the one loose end I haven't tied up
A young girl who's out there somewhere,  helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic
Damn it, Hartigan, I won't let you do this
You're gonna get yourself killed
You're gonna get us both killed
I won't let you
I'm warnin' you
You're draggin' me down with you
I'm your partner
They can kill me, too
I ain't puttin' up with that
I'm gettin' on the horn, calling for backup
We'll just wait
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat  gets his sick thrills with victim number four
Victim number four
Nancy Callahan, age 11
And that backup that we're waitin' on will just so happen to show up  just late enough for Roark to get back to his US Senator daddy
Take a deep breath, Hartigan
Settle down and think straight
You're pushin' 60 and you got a bum ticker
You got a great attitude, Bob
Real credit to the force, you are
Eileen's at home waitin' for you
Heck, Bob...  maybe you are right
I'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense
[grunts]  to end a partnership
Hell of a way to start my retirement
Nancy Callahan, age 11
a very good girl, Nancy
You've been very quiet
We're gonna be taking you home soon
But first, we're going to introduce you to somebody
where Weevil said they took her,  and it hits
Wicked spot of indigestion
[groaning]  At least that's what I pray it is
The briefest indulgement in automotive pleasure
Such shortlived durability, Mr. Shlubb
You would risk engenderating ill will on the part of our employers
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet,  remanded to our custody, though it may be,  remains the property of the son of Senator Roark
Take 'em down fast
A dent, the merest scratch thereupon,  and beforementioned consequences which I made mention  shall surely be athwart us
[heart beating]  [groans]  Give your heart time to slow down
But it won't slow down
She needs you
We're all done here, Benny
Let's give them some time together
Give them some privacy
I'm making sure they get along really well
What kind of beast couldn't get along with a precious little girl like this
But you've got nothing to be scared of
All we're gonna do is have a nice little talk
That's all
Just a nice talk
Just you and me
it'd be like this
Just take the pill he gave you
No need to play it quiet
Breathe steady, old man
Prove you're not completely useless
What the hell
He likes to hear 'em scream
I've seen his victims and their twisted little faces,  all widemouthed and bugeyed, frozen in their last horrible moment of living
No screams
Either I'm just in time, or I'm way too late
a flesh wound
On your feet, old man
Let the girl go
You know who I am
You know who my father is
You can't touch me, you pieceofshit cop
Look at you
You can't even lift that cannon you're carrying
I don't want you watching this
I mean it, baby
Cover your eyes right now
[Hartigan] I take his weapons away
[screaming]   Both of them
[screaming]    to end a partnership
don't make it any worse
Don't make me kill you
Never better
[Roark groaning]  I'm ready to kick your ass
Just a few more minutes
Sit down and stay down
I'll kill you if I have to
Can't kill her once backup gets here
Run home, Nancy
Run for your life
Hey
Don't listen to him
What a tough man you are
You stay right where you're at
You shoot your partner in the back...  then you try to scare a girl
Maybe I'll pull my spare rod,  plug you a couple of times, show you how it's done
We could've worked something out
Sit down or I'll blast you in half
Sit down
You'll never be able to stop me
The sirens are close now
She'll be safe
I don't mind much
Getting sleepy
It's OK.  She'll be safe
An old man dies,  a little girl lives
Fair trade
Just tell me it isn't true, John
What they're saying about you and that child
If you ever want to see me again...  say something now
We're looking at your basic mountain of DNA evidence
The testimony of your own partner,  corroboration by six eyewitnesses, and that's just so far  and there's your own silence
I'll do what I can, but let us just say you are good and screwed
What's shuttin' you up
This whole thing stinks to high heaven
I'm not the only one on the force who smells it
That's my job
But don't expect any friendly chitchat out of me, mister
I heard what you done to that girl
Evenin', officer
I don't have to introduce myself, do I
You read the papers
This being an election year, you've seen plenty of my picture
And I'm doin' you, Hartigan
Cold and hard, I'm doing you
You blew my son's ear off
You blew his arm off
You even blew his nuts and his pecker off
He's in a coma right now
My boy
He could've been the first Roark to become the president  but you went and turned him into a braindamaged, dickless freak
Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful
Power don't come from a badge or a gun
Lying big, and gettin' the whole damn world to play along with you
There's what, maybe 500 people in this hospital
I could pump you full of bullets right now, and I wouldn't even be arrested
Everyone would lie for me, everyone who counts
Otherwise, their lies, everything that runs Sin City,  it all comes tumbling down like a pack of cards
But I want you firm and fit and healthy
I'm even putting up cash of my own to get you more surgery
Fix that heart condition of yours
You're gonna keep on living a long time
You're gonna be convicted of raping that little brat, and shooting my boy
You're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison,  disgraced, destroyed...  alone
You tell her the truth and she's dead
You tell anybody the truth and they're dead
They won't let me testify
I told the cops that you saved my life and they just acted like I was crazy
They talked my parents into keeping me away
I told them you saved me from that Roark creep,  but they won't even check me out to see that I'm still a virgin
I'm still a virgin, still alive, thanks to you
They got it all backwards
But you'll always remember things right
That's gonna mean a lot to me
But stay away, Nancy
They'll kill you if you don't stay away
Don't visit me
Don't write me
Maybe you won't let me visit, but I'll still write to you, Hartigan
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia.
That's the name of a really cool detective in books I read
I'll write you every week... for forever
Now, run on home
It's not safe for you here
Bye, Nancy
[groans]  John Hartigan
Mr. Law and Order
Mr. By the Book
Mr. High and Mighty
It's catching up with you now, friend of mine
It's catching up with you but good
He doesn't look good
Oh
He's hale and hearty, Tammy
See
[laughing]  That Tammy, there, she's fine, isn't she
I rented her out of Old Town
I wanted to show you what you won't be getting any of, not in prison
You hear me, Hartigan
If you stop being stupid, start playing along with us,  you might just get some of Tammy
You see that
You make her sick
She heard about you and that little girl
I promised myself I'd pay,  and I'm paying it
You don't save a little girl's life,  then turn around and throw her to the dogs
Not in my book, you don't
There was a letter from Nancy waiting when they put me in solitary
She calls herself "Cordelia," just like she promised
She makes no mention of anything that would give her away
At first, I figure she'll send another note or two  before her young mind moves on to better things
But every Thursday, another one arrives
What a sweet kid
I do my best to keep my hand from shaking when I reach for it
She's the only friend I've got, the daughter I never had
Eight years pass
Then comes a Thursday when I bound from my cot,  excited as a kid at Christmas,  only to find myself staring at the damn floor of my damn cell,  looking for a letter from Nancy that isn't there
Then another Thursday with no letter
Is she all right
Nothing
Two months now
Not a word from Nancy
Did they find her
Did they get to her
Of course
Stupid old man
Do your math
How long did you expect her to keep writing
She was a saint to keep it up as long as she did
You're alone
You're all alone
This guy smells awful, like bad food
Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster in the middle of summer
Practically knocked my head off, the bastard
When I come to, I see it
The same kind of envelope Nancy always uses,  but there's no letter inside of it
There's something soft, something that ought to be alive,  a hunk of meat and bone that ought to be the index finger  of the right hand of a 19yearold girl
She was so careful
She never gave away where she lives or where she works
I've got to help her
Nothing else matters
Not my life and not my pride, either
It's only one final surrender they want
You beat me
[phone ringing]  [sirens wailing]  I'll get it, Claire
It's gotta be Marv
He never sleeps and he's always getting himself in deep
Yeah
Hartigan, my God, it is you
Yes, yes
No, I'll get right on it, right this second
I'll be there by ten, I promise
She almost slugged me when I stopped her from hiring a new attorney
When I refused to plead innocent she did slug me
When she hears what I'm gonna do she'll probably slug me again
Hartigan
It's like they were waiting for my call
They're ready to deal
They're practically begging for a deal
One of them promised me you'd be out on parole  if you confessed and expressed regret and all that other dumb crap  that, of course, we won't go for
Then, we're gonna turn right around and sue those sorry sons of bitches  for false prosecution
You're gonna be exonerated
You're gonna be a very rich man
This isn't like you think it is
Like hell it isn't
Doesn't take a genius to figure out who framed you
But even Senator Roark...  You hung up the phone too soon
He will never know what hit him
I'm gonna confess
Excuse me
John Hartigan, crawling on his belly in front of a parole board,  confessing to raping a little girl and blubbering for mercy
No, doesn't work
I'm agreeing to anything they want from me
All right, you son of a bitch
Let's get this over with
hear, just the way they want to hear it
I tell them I'm a twisted, wretched child molester
I agree to everything they want from me
I love you, Nancy
You care for a ride
Long as you stay in front of me
Prison's made you paranoid
Talk about water under the bridge
Yeah
Eight years
Well, if it's any consolation to you...  you made me hate myself
Any word from Eileen
Yeah
She got remarried four years ago
I'm sorry, John
Nah
I'm glad
Eileen always wanted kids
She'll make a good mother
Like you said, Bob, water under the bridge
with fond farewells to each other,  then I go looking for the only human being who means a damn to me:  Nancy
How did they find out who you are
And what have they done to you, baby
Not a sound
No sign of life
Has Roark gone to all this trouble just to torture a broken old man,  like a kid poking at a fly when he's already torn his wings off
What has he done to Nancy
No diary, no phone numbers or addresses written down anywhere
Closest thing to a clue is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon
It's a long shot, but maybe she's got some friends there
A dead end
But if there's anything to be found, the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is  or who kidnapped and mutilated her, this is the place
Wondering if you could help me
I'm looking for somebody
Cold night like this, everybody's looking for somebody, stranger
It's not like that
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim
She's just warming up
She grew up
She filled out
Nancy Callahan, 19 years old
And here I was, expecting a skinny little bookworm,  maybe a bit too shy for her own good
How little she told me about herself in all her letters for all those years
How the hell did they find her
They were bluffing
I've /ed them straight to her
She hasn't spotted you yet
Turn around and walk out the door
Get that Beretta away from him somehow, and kill him
Just a few seconds and she'll be safe
No, Nancy
Don't notice me
Don't recognize me
There's no time to explain
I've made a terrible mistake, put you in terrible danger
Whatever you say, Hartigan
Let me throw some clothes on
And here I'd figured you'd forgotten all about me
Kept me going
Kept me from killing myself
Hurry up, will you
Maybe I should drive
Not a chance
Besides, from the sound of things, you might have to shoot somebody
I don't have a gun
Under the seat
It's loaded and it works
Yeah, this'll do
Kicks like a mule
You've never been far from my thoughts
I've lain awake nights, thinking of you
What are you talking about
Keep driving, Nancy
Keep driving and keep the car on the road
What are you doing
Prove you're still worth a damn
Try to keep it on the road, Nancy
He's got skill, but he's in too much of a hurry
Throwing away bullets like they were candy
Aim careful and look the devil in the eye
Ah
Stop the car, Nancy
What
Stop the car, now
Right
Stop the car, confirm the kill
Sorry
I got a little rattled
Sit tight
No
Let me stay close
Nothing can happen to me when I'm with you
Please
Let me stay close
His blood smells worse than he does
Jesus
But the creep himself, he's gone
I used to welcome the sound
Nothing to do now but find a place for the night,  get Nancy calmed down, and figure out what on Earth I'm going to do next
The stink... somehow it stays with us all the way to the motel
Nancy, I went to your apartment
Your window was thrown wide open
The rooms looked almost empty
My window
Robbed again
That's the third time this year
But there I was, just like before, scared and helpless
I'm such an asshole
You should sit down
better if you sit down
When it comes to reassuring a traumatized 19yearold,  I'm as expert as a palsy victim doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench
It's always been you, Hartigan
It's just nerves making you say that, Nancy
You're just exhausted
You need to sleep
Sleep with me
Stop it, Nancy
Why do you think I kept writing you those letters
It wasn't just gratitude
I tried to fall in love with boys
Even thought I did once or twice
But I was already in love... with you
No
There's wrong and there's wrong and then there's this
I love you
I love you, too
With all my heart
Recognize my voice, Hartigan
I look different, but I bet you can recognize my voice
Sure
I recognize your voice, Junior
Everything's gone straight to hell
Suckered by a spoiled brat son of a senator
It's all gone to hell
I got a dead man needs to be fetched
I want you to set me up for a party
I've already got the girl, you dumb shit
Hey, it better be perfect or I'm calling my dad
It better be ready
It better be perfect
I get to do whatever I want, however I want, whenever I want it
My dad..
He spent a fortune hiring every expert on the planet  to grow back that equipment you blew off between my legs,  just so the old fart can hold out some kind of hope of having a grand kid
Although, as you can see, there were some side effects
I'm not complaining
Since you've been gone, I'm having the time of my life
We wondered who wrote those letters
She left not a clue
Clever girl
And so pretty, so pretty
Nancy, don't scream
Whatever he does to you, don't scream
I'm gonna take all night doing dear old Nancy
And you're gonna die knowing that it's all your fault
They've all screamed, Hartigan
Dozens of them, maybe a hundred
Eight years' worth
Every one of them has screamed
If there weren't so many people hereabout,  I would show you how I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream
It's gonna be one hell of a show
No hope left
No chance
This is it
No
Keep your neck tight
Move
The window, maybe there's an alarm
The window
Keep your neck tight, goddamn it
Stay conscious
No alarm
The glass
Cut the rope
You can do it
to comment with marked displeasure on your rash impulsiveness  in selecting such an eyecatching and impractical car  to heist, Mr. Shlubb
Protest though you might, Mr. Klump,  you must nonetheless admit to the sheer phallic majesty  of said Ferrari's performance
Irrelevant to said mission is the following query,  which I now put forth to you:  Wherein this most streamlined  and trunkless of transports,  bonerinspiring though it may be,  wherein are we to reposit our recently deceased cargo
A worthy concern
Neatly elucidated
I can only express puzzlement that borders on alarm
Tell me where Roark takes the girls or I'll cut your damn head off
In plain English, creep
The answer you seek is rural, even agrarian
The farm
Shlubb and Klump were packing an arsenal
But at first, I'll have to play it quiet
Quiet and nasty
Nancy's car, six miles from the farm
Good girl
The car stalled out on that yellow bastard  and you didn't tell him how to start it up again
You kept your mouth shut
I'll bet Junior was furious
But you stayed strong
You bought a few extra minutes
There's still a chance, Nancy
Don't scream
I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm  and make my way through the woods
I'm not halfway there when it hits
Bad cough
Blood in it
Doesn't matter now
I don't have to stay alive that much longer, anyway
Rotten way to kill a man, but it's quiet
you stupid cow
Is that it
Do you think I'm getting tired
You're the one who's gonna crack
You'll crack
You'll cry and beg
You'll scream
Oh, yeah, you'll scream, you big, fat, ugly cow
You'll scream
That was foreplay
Hartigan was right about you
You're pathetic
You're pathetic
It's not wise at all to make fun of me like that
It brings out the worst in me
In too much of a hurry
It can't be
just like I told myself I wouldn't
Stupid old man
[man] You tagged him good
[man 2] Perforate the fool
It's over
Let her go
You're dreaming, Hartigan
I see your eyes while I fillet the woman of your dreams in front of you
You're about to keel over
Sure, I can
You gave me a scare there for a second there, old man
Nancy, I'm sorry
First I soften you up, and then it's showtime
Here it comes
It's gonna hurt
You're right about that.  
[gasping] ' [sighs]  Sucker
[screaming]  Eight long years, son of a bitch
is pounding wet chunks of bone  into the floorboards, so I stop
So long, Junior
Been a pleasure
I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once
I know it, baby
You grew up strong
to the car, Nancy stops shaking
Her skin is warm again
Thanks for remembering my coat
And for all the little things
Like saving my life, twice
You're not coming along
No
I have friends on their way, to collect evidence
I'm gonna blow this whole sick mess wide open
I'm gonna clear my name
I'm gonna put Senator Roark behind bars where he belongs
You'll never lose me, Nancy
Shame to lie to her
I hope she forgives me for it
Get Senator Roark behind bars
Sure
There isn't a prosecutor in the state who'll go after Senator Roark
I killed his only son
The bloodline is cut
Roark's lost his goddamn legacy
He'll use all his power to get revenge on me
He'll go after me through Nancy
He'll find her again
There 'll be no end to it
Not as long as I'm alive
There's only one way to beat him
An old man dies,  a young woman lives
Fair trade
like the last leaf on a dying tree
I let her hear my footsteps
She only goes stiff for a moment
Sure
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am
I didn't come here for the party
I came here for you
I've watched you for days
You're everything a man could ever want
It's not just your face,  your figure or your voice
It's your eyes
What is it you see in my eyes
I see a crazy calm
You're sick of running
You're ready to face what you have to face
No
I don't want to face it alone
She's soft and warm and almost weightless
I tell her that everything will be all right
That I'll save her from whatever she's scared of and take her far, far away
I tell her I love her
I hold her close until she's gone
I'll never know what she was running from
I'll cash her check in the morning
It's not the city
I could've gotten in a traffic accident anywhere
Yeah, just a fracture
The doctor said it's a clean break
It should be right as rain in no time
Uhhuh
Mmhmm
and you can find... anything
Care for a smoke
Love you, too, Mom
It's a lousy room in a lousy pan' of a lousy town
I'm staring at a goddess
I'm not gonna waste one more second wondering how I've gotten so lucky
like angels ought to smell
The perfect woman
The goddess
I need you
She says her name is Goldie
And that cold thing happens to my stomach
And I realize Goldie's dead
Not a mark on her
She was murdered and I was right here when it happened
Lying next to her, stone drunk, just like she was
Damn it, Goldie
Who were you and who wanted you dead
Who were you besides an angel of mercy,  giving a twotime loser like me the night of his life
It sure as hell wasn't my looks
So why the sleazy saloon
too much, showing up before anybody  but me and the killer could know there's been a murder
No reason at all to play it quiet
No reason to play it any way but my way
Whoever killed you is gonna pay, Goldie
I'll be right out
I don't know why and I don't know how I never even met you before tonight,  but you were a friend and more when I needed one
And when I find out who did it,  it won't be quick and quiet like it was with you
It'll be loud and nasty, my kind of kill
I love you, Goldie
[siren blares in distance]  [helicopter passing]   Claire
Now, don't worry, Lucille
I was just grazed
No way I'm giving you any alcohol
Besides, it's not what you came here for anyway, is it
No
Go ahead
You're worse without 'em
You're the best
She's a dyke, but God knows why
With that body of hers she could have any man she wants
She tried to analyze me once but she got too scared
Haven't seen you like this in a while
Got in a fight with some cops
Didn't happen to kill any of them
Not that I know
But they know they've been in a fight, that's for damn sure
There ain't no squaring it
Not this time
Or some creep with a gas can trying to torch someone
Hey, hey
This is big
Settle down, Marv
Take another pill
There ain't no settlin' down
This is the old days and the bad days, the allornothing days
They're back
And I'm ready for war
Prison was hell for you
It's gonna be life this time
Hell's waking up every goddamn day and not even knowing why you're here
But I'm out now
It took somebody who was kind to me getting killed to do it
I know exactly what I gotta do
[helicopter passing]  [Marv] Now, for Gladys
Sweet Gladys
Mom still hasn't changed a thing in this room
Every week she dusts it all off so it looks like it was only yesterday  that I moved out
Every time I come visit, she has me sleep in here,  and the old smells make me cry like they do right now
I knew Gladys would be safe here
I call her Gladys after one of the sisters from school
She's almost lived up to the name
Good as ever
I tell her about Goldie and what we have to do
Marvin
Yes, Mom
I'm sorry I woke you up
There were men here looking for you
They weren't police
It was about my job
I got a new job
It's night work
What did you do to your face
You're getting confused again, aren't you
Mom, I feel better than I have in years
weren't you, Goldie
Somebody wanted you dead and you knew it
So you hit the saloons, the bad places,  looking for the biggest, meanest lug around and finding me
Walk down the right back alley in Sin City...   Leave your hands off Nancy
...and you could find anything
That coat looks like Baghdad
Take off
He's new here, Marv
He didn't know
Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy,  shoulder to shoulder with all the other losers like me
But that's not what I'm lookin' for tonight
I'm looking for something small and hairy
Take it easy, Weevil
It's money in your pocket
Spread the word
Tell him I've been hitting the joints drunk off my butt,  shooting my mouth off, crying over some hot babe named Goldie
A shot and a brew, Shellie, and keep 'em comin'
Sure, honey
You take it slow, now
He just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century
He'd be right at home on some ancient battlefield,  swinging an ax into somebody's face
Or in a Roman arena taking a sword to other gladiators like him
They'd have tossed him girls like Nancy back then
Drink up
That's one finelooking coat you're wearing there
Your killin' days are over, you overthehill, dogooder son of a bitch
you do to them, you don't feel bad
What
A fine coat, you're bleeding all over it
All right, it's all yours
Oh, God
The guy who did that, he knew what he was doing
So tell me, man
I don't hear you giving me any names
So I guess when I shot you in the belly I aimed a little too high
[screams]  [gunshot]  and I'm gonna have to get really nasty
It was Telly... Telly Stern passed me the order
He runs the tables over to the Triple Ace Club
Thanks again
damnedest thing happens
Just need my medicine, is all
Bastard
You're gonna pay for what you did to me
Feel like talking, Louie
It was Connelly
He set me up
He'll never talk
I don't know about you, but I'm havin' a ball
I don't want to keep you up all night,  so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch
These here hands of mine, they got blood all over 'em
You're speaking figuratively
When I need to find something out, I just go out and look for somebody  that knows more than me, and I go and I ask them
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard
Tortured 'em first
You might say I been working my way up the food chain
First two were minnows, smalltime messengers
But it was Connelly, the money man, who fingered you, Padre
Dear Lord, man, this is a house of God
Just give me a damn name
You really are pushing your luck,  feeding me garbage like that
It can't be that big
There's a farm at North Cross and Lennox
Find out for yourself
And while you're at it,  ask yourself if that corpse of a slut is worth dying for
Worth killing for
Amen
His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes,  or at least that's what they're passing off as a Mercedes these days
Modern cars: they all look like electric shavers
[grunts]  Goldie
[grunts]  It couldn't be Goldie
It's my own fault, and nobody else 's, that I got confused
I've been having so much fun I forgot to take my medicine
That wasn't Goldie back there
Goldie's dead,  and that's the whole reason that I've been doing what I've been doing
When you got a condition, it's bad to forget your medicine
The cold thing,  it creeps into my gut and tells me one more time it won't let go
[barking, growling]  I don't want to fight, pooch
I got no gripe with you
Easy, boy
my gun on you, buddy
So I sniff around to see what's buried
Here we go
It's impossible
Nobody can sneak up on me
Not a sound
Nobody's that quiet
Except the one who snuck into that hotel room two nights ago
It was you, you bastard
You killed her
It was... [grunts]   I found your killer, but he was better than me
Too quiet, too quick
A killer born
Why didn't he finish the job
He keeps the heads
He eats the rest
It's not just that wolf of his
The wolf just gets scraps
Bones
He... eats... people
He cooks them like they were steaks
Let's get you warm
Just like they were steaks
Now he's got both of us
It's all right
Just look at the heads on the wall
The heads on the wall
Son of a bitch
He kept smiling that damned smile
He made me watch him suck the meat off my fingers
Oh, Jesus
Christ, I could use a cigarette
gotta do is let it out
And a few buckets later, there's no way you'd know
Whoever's behind this whole thing has his connections right in the department
Any leads
One guy I talked to told me it was Roark running the show
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out that hooker almost before I did
The one you've been obsessing over
The dead one
Goldie
I didn't know she was a hooker
Doesn't make any difference about anything
She was highclass stuff
Must have shown you quite a time
There's a car coming
[horn honks]  [man] Kevin
and a name
I'll see you later, Kevin
They're done checking the house
They're coming this way
Bastards
I'll show them.  
No, don't shoot
Please
Listen to me
I'm his parole officer
Captain, the target, there's no sign of him
Here's a sign
[screaming]   That there is one damn fine coat you're wearing
I was pretty steamed about what he'd done to Lucille,  so I took my time with that son of a bitch
Just a name: Patrick Henry Roark, man of the cloth
Could've become president, but he chose to serve God
Along the way, he happened to become the most powerful man in the state
He's brought down mayors and governors like they were nothing
He even made his rotten brother a US senator without breaking a sweat
I'm getting used to the idea
More and more, I'm liking the sound of it
Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts
I've got a condition
I get confused sometimes
And with Lucille dead, I can't get my medicine
What if I've imagined all of this
What if I've turned into what they've always said I was gonna turn into
A maniac
Can't kill a man without knowing for sure you ought to
I've gotta know for sure
The merchandise is on display by the time I make my way to Old Town
For an hour or so, I ask around about Goldie
I don't get any answers, but I know I'm bound to
You can't be Goldie
Goldie's dead
I haven't eaten anything or taken my medicine for days now
Bastard
He's crazy
Hit him again, Wendy
Harder
Wait a minute
Why did she call you Wendy
My twin sister
I guess she was the nice one
Goldie and the other six, where are they
What did you do to them
You crazy goddamn broad
Just take a look at this mug
None of you would, but Goldie
And she only did because she thought I could protect her
But as soon as they had me for a fall guy, they showed up, guns blazing
But they didn't get me, and I've been killing my way to the truth ever since
So, go ahead, doll
Shoot me now, or get the hell out of my way
OK, I'm glad we got all that sorted out
What the hell
I tied those knots
That's my specialty
Well, sure
I thought I might be able to talk some sense into you
And I probably would have had to paste you one,  and I don't hurt girls
I need a pair of handcuffs
I got a collection
Just give him the ones you got with you, Gail
It was a farm boy named Kevin who killed Goldie,  but it was Cardinal Roark who was behind it, and I don't know why
I know that sounds crazy
No, it doesn't
Goldie worked the clergy
a puzzle piece falls smack in my lap
And suddenly, my heart's pounding so loud I can't hear anything else
I want to reach over and touch her and taste Goldie's sweat one more time
But she isn't Goldie
the old home security, huh
so I'm in this one to the end
Why are you willing to go up against Roark for someone you barely knew
She was nice to me, gave me something I didn't even know existed
I wasn't never even able to buy a woman
You know, the way I look
It's almost killing time, and I'd better get sharp
I check the list: rubber tubing, gas, saw,  gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet,  Gladys and my mitts
We're close enough
Pull over
Keep the engine runnin'
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get the hell outta here and don't look back
Kill him for me, Marv
I won't let you down, Goldie
Getting himself a midnight snack, and I can guess what kind
Come on, you son of a bitch
Is that the best you can do, creep
That's right
Get personal, get close
I can take it
I got you, you little bastard
Let's see you hop around now
My muscles make me a thousand promises of pain to come
Let me do it, Marv
Let me finish him
You wasn't supposed to come down here, Wendy
Oh, but I want to..
It'll give you nightmares
I'm good and bushed
And it's not that fight of ours that did me in, either
It's all that sawing and tying
It's not as easy as it looks
Could have been a real mess around here  if I didn't have that tubing for tourniquets
I gotta admit, there was a spurt or two,  to get the scent in the air, to get that friend of yours to come running
Look who's here
Here he comes
[growling]  That's a good dog
Somehow the bastard is still alive, still staring at me
Not even when I grab the saw and finish the job
He never screams
I put in a call to Kadie 's and ask Nancy to get her clothes on  and meet me at her place
She says, "Yes," like always
Sure, Marv
There isn't much of anything Nancy wouldn't do for me
Not since a year back when a frat boy roughed her up  and I straightened him out but good
It really gets my goat when guys rough up dames
What do you want me to do with her
Well, your best bet is drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks
Are you leaving town
Hell, no
I like it here
and stay under the speed limit  so as not to get any attention
My head starts to clear
Things start to make sense
I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up
So, if going after Roark means dying, win or lose,  hell, I'll die laughing if I know I've done this one thing right
Quiet as a grave out here
Kevin
What's left of him, anyways
Oh, my God
You monster
You demon
He had the voice of an angel, yet he spoke only to me
And he's dead now because of one stupid whore
It's not a real good idea for you to talk about Goldie  that way while I'm around
When he came to me...  he was a tormented boy
Tormented by guilt
I tried to counsel him
But the eating, it filled him with white light
Tearful, he swore to me that he felt the touch of God Almighty
I know it's pretty damn weird to eat people
And I joined in
They were all whores
Nobody cared for them
Nobody missed them
She stayed in public places
And then with you
You were so convenient
You'd broke a man's jaw that very night
Kevin killed her
I ordered the police in for you, but you wouldn't be caught
You wouldn't stop
And now he's dead and you're here to...  eliminate me
Will that give you satisfaction, my son
Killing a helpless old fart
The killing, no
Kevin...  we're going home
You can scream now if you want to
It's just like I promised, only better
And when his eyes go dead, the hell I sent him to  must seem like heaven after what I've done to him.  
[man] Freeze
[man 2] Oh, my God
[heart monitor beeping]  [Marv groans] Jerks
They should've shot me in the head, and enough times to make sure
Everybody knows what's coming, but they go through the motions anyway
What a waste of time
Months fall off the calendar while I breathe and eat through tubes
After a while, I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that
I'm on my feet for ten minutes  before the cops kick them out from under me
They just keep knocking the crap out of me and waving a confession in my face
And I keep spitting blood all over it  and laughing at how many fresh copies they come up with
Then along comes this worm assistant district attorney  who turns the recorder off and says if I don't sign their confession,  they'll kill my mom
I break his arm in three places and I sign it
From then on, it's the circus everybody wants it to be
The judge is all fire and brimstone when she hands down the sentence
Midnight and my death are only a few hours away,  when I get my first surprise in 18 months
My only visitor
I'm ready for anything but that scent
Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy
I..
I got confused again
Just seeing you like this
like angels ought to smell
The perfect woman
Goldie
She says her name is Goldie
They fix me a pretty decent steak for my last meal
They even throw in a brew
It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's
Then they shave my head and fix me with a rubber diaper and get to it
And it's about damned time, if you ask me
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow..."  Would you get a move on
You heard the man
Is that the best you can do, you pansies
He's gone
Forget it, man
You can bang on that door all night if you want to
you're doing this to me, Shellie
Everything we've shared..
It has to mean something to you
Plenty of lost pay on account of how nobody wants  to flirt with a waitress whose face is all purple and swollen up with bruises
I know you're angry, baby
I forgive you for that without you asking me to
There's a difference between getting honked off at a guy who's not so bad,  and finding out that you've been sweettalked by a total jerk loser  who skips out on a wife he doesn't even tell you about  every time he gets drunk, which is way too often
That hurt, Shellie
It's one thing for you to play hard to get,  but don't go trying to cut my nuts off
I am impossible to get
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy, and get help,  like... a shrink
Get help and get lost
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie
Just open the door and you'll see how wrong you've been about me
Oblige him, Shellie
I'm ready for him
No
If he knew that you were here with me,   you don't know how bad this could get
This clown's got a big, mean drunk on
Hey, I could swear I heard somebody in there with you just now
Somebody
Jackie Boy, it's a regular African love fest in here
I mean, I got me all five starters,  half the bench of the Basin City Blues keeping me company
You feel like taking them on
Some of my best friends..
But you're really pushing my buttons
And the whole time you've been doing me like this,  I've been too polite to point out that any time I want to,  I could kick this damn door to splinters
You know what I can do
One, two...  All right, then
All right
Troops, make yourself at home
You brought your whole pack with you
You're gonna love this, baby
Call up some of your friends who work the saloon
With you and the bunch of us, we're gonna hit every joint in town,   and it's gonna be great
I ain't calling up nobody
You got somebody's love stink all over you
You've been with another man and you've been with him tonight
Who is he
He's Superman
[Jackie Boy chuckling]  I have no feelings at all
just go ahead and get it over with, you sick bastard
lying about me again,  right in front of my friends
I have never hit a woman in my life
That's showing her, man
You goddamn coward
Baby, we're here to have a good time
Yeah
I gotta take a leak
Then you could've met my boyfriend
Could've seen what a real man looks like
There you go, after my nuts again
But I forgive you
He is generous
But that temper of his...  You never should have picked on him like you did
My temper you don't have to worry about
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself or I'll cut your little pecker off
Oh, you don't wanna be hitting the streets dressed like that
It's a jungle out there
Hey, baby, I don't hear you making those calls
Answer me
Oh, I don't need this grief
Hi
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again, you even think her name,  and I'll cut you in ways that'll make you useless to a woman
You're making a big mistake, man
A big mistake
Yeah
You already made a big mistake yourself
You didn't flush
Troops, get outta here
No questions
Now
I don't think he'll be bothering you again
How's your jaw
I've been slapped around worse
And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him
And it was only once
I've done some dumb things
Seeing how I'm one of those dumb things,  I can't give you too hard a time about that
But this guy, he's a menace
He might kill somebody if I don't stop him
I'll call you later
I can't make out  over the racket of a passing police 'copter
Stop
It sounds like "stop,"  but I can't be sure
They're a pack of predators and they're out for blood tonight: a woman's blood
Damn it, Dwight
Damn it
You fool
You damned fool
I'm speeding
That's a good way to get yourself noticed
If you're a murderer with a new face who's one fingerprint check away  from the fast track to the gas chamber like I am,  the last thing you want is to get noticed
I don't have nearly enough cash on me to bribe this cop, and even if I did,  there's the outside chance he's one of the honest ones
Do I try to talk my way out of this, or do I take this cop down and risk it all
Watch it, Jack
[horn honking]   [tires screeching]  [siren wailing]  Cops
They're right on our ass
Not where we're headed
Jackie Boy's leading us straight to Old Town
The cop shuts off his siren
The ladies are the law here, beautiful and merciless
If you've got cash and play by the rules,  they'll make all your dreams come true
Squad car's long gone
I called it
Was I right
You're always right, Jack
None of us ever doubted you for a second
But I heard things about these girls
Who's out of line
Ha
Hey, baby
Hey, baby
Hop in, sugar
Aw, sweetheart, I work the day shift and it's been a long day
Get in the car, baby
We'll just talk
It'll be nice
I don't do talk jobs, either
I've been beat up every time I turn around
But the day I get turned down by a hooker  when I got good, hardearned cash to pay her with,  well, there's only so much a man can take
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo
The Amigo's a fag joint
a good time humiliating me like this  for no damn reason at all
That's far enough, Dwight
We've been on top of these peckervvoods  since they showed up with that cop behind them
Enjoy the show
The ladies are their own enforcers
How's the barmaid
You know, the one that never shuts up
Not right now, Gail
Ooh
Wound up a little tight, aren't we
That's your whole problem, Dwight
That, and your lousy taste in women
These days, anyway
Damn it, Gail
Those clowns down the way, they some of the barmaid's boyfriends
One of them thinks he is
I followed them here to make sure he didn't hurt any of the girls
Us helpless little girls
to hit less than 20 yards ahead of us,  and still it's hard to take my eyes off her
Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot
Those boys in that Chrysler are one mistake away  from seeing what Miho can do
to the pixie perched on the roof's edge
Deadly little Miho
[girl] You're running out of alley
Turn around
a sassy little thing
You ain't hardly in any kind of position to be making threats
locked and ready to spring
So what
They deserve what's coming
So why this rotten feeling in my gut that something is awfully wrong
They haven't killed anybody I know about
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place, but they didn't kill anybody
Something Shellie said
I can't place it
OK, OK, OK
I sounded off a little more than I should have
Over the edge
It's not a woman you need
You couldn't handle a woman, the state you're in
She's saying you ain't got what it takes, Jack
You wanna see it
You wanna see what I got
Huh
I've seen all shapes, all sizes
You seen this one
Oh, sugar, you just gone and done the dumbest thing in your whole life
This is crazy
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all
Go ahead
Go ahead
Go ahead
He's got the drop on her
He's dead
He's just too damn dumb to know it
I got you right where I want you
This is a careerending wound, whore
And there's gonna be hell to pay
Watch your step, Jackie Boy
This isn't funny
Don't anyone laugh
Every one of you is gonna burn
You're only making it worse
You shut the hell up
Don't pull the trigger
It'll backfire
I told you to shut up
I can't see
What's happening
I can't hear anything
For God's sake, Miho, finish him
Yeah
Make it quick, will you
quite chop his head off
Then it's straight to business:  Stretching corpses out on the floor and going through their pockets,  divvying up cash when they find it
His wallet is packed
MasterCard, Discover, Platinum American Express,  and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties  that I'm not too proud to stuff into my own pockets
Then I find an atom bomb
Jackie Boy,  you son of a bitch
There was a helicopter that kicked up such a racket,  I couldn't quite make out what she said
I thought Shellie said "stop.
She said "cop.
Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty
A goddamn hero cop
It's held for years, the shaky truce
The cops get a slice of the profits  and free entertainment when they throw a party
The girls administer their own brand of justice
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood  and he's not shopping for what the girls are selling, they send him packing,  but they send him back alive
That's the rules
That's the truce
The cops stay out
Old Town will be left wide open
It'll be war
Women's blood
The cops
The mob
Things are gonna go back to the way they used to be
The hell they will
We got guns
We'll go to war
[Dwight] Don't be stupid
You wouldn't stand a chance
Get me a car
Did you forget that cop car that trailed them here
The cops know Rafferty came here
They'll check the river, they'll check the sewer
They'll find him and come gunning for us
The cops won't check
Get that out of my face or I'll smack ya
Who do you think you are, giving orders
You got what you wanted out of us
Shut up, Gail
You got what you wanted out of me
Gone until you brought this unholy mess on us
One word from Gail and she'll cut me in half
They'll be watching the roads
It'll be the bad old days all over again
The pimps, the beatings, the drugs, the rapes
They won't be watching the roads
Get me a damn hardtop
If I don't make it, you can have your war
Get that gun out of my face now
Ah
Bastard
I forgot how quick you are
An explosion that blasts away the dull, gray years  between the now and that one fiery night when she was mine
A hardtop with a decent engine
And make sure it's got a big trunk
I'll always love you, baby
Just look at that trunk
We'll never fit 'em all in
Gail
Um, unless there's something else you want me to do,  you think maybe I could go home
All this blood and stuffs got me feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl
But don't you talk to anybody, not even your mom
They'll never fit in that trunk
Not like this, they won't
Miho
Dry your hair as soon as you get home
Yeesh
Hey, Becky
Gail said no calls
I won't tell her nothing
Please, don't say nothing to Gail
Hey, Mom
What were they thinking,  sticking me with a beatup bucket of bolts like this
There wasn't anything we could do but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me,  out where anybody who cares to look will see him
Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes
It'll help
It's got you smoking there, bud
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy
I'm just imagining this, so shut the hell up
It's got you hearing things
It's got your nerves shot
It's got you smoking
You know it's true
[wheezing]  Nobody ever really quits
And your chips are down
I'm fine
You shut the hell up
Will you look at that
Ooh
Those hookers let you down
You sucker for the babes, you
You ain't even gonna make it to the pits
You shut the hell up
I'll make it
Ah, this is great
Just like being in a buddy movie
Shut up
_ [Jackie Boy laughing]   Boy, you're screwed, you're out, you're finished
Stick a fork in it
You're swirling around the bottom of the bowl,  nosediving down the pipe
It's over
to tell him to shut up
Sure, he's an asshole
Sure, he's dead
Sure, I'm just imagining that he's talking
I don't have a chance in hell of outrunning this cop
Not in this heap
Pull over
The only question left is whether I'm gonna kill him or not
For all I know, he's an honest cop, regular guy,  a working stiff with a mortgage, a wife and a pile of kids
My hand moves all on its own,  sliding one of my guns to my lap and thumbing back the hammer
Better stop
You're making him mad
Whatever you say
Your friend here... party a little too hard tonight
I'm the designated driver
I'll let you off with a warning
What next
a quarter mile from the pits
I shove the TBird the rest of the way
A few minutes' more work and it'll all be over
Do what I say
Clear the streets
We're not selling any tail in Old Town
Not tonight
Don't struggle
You'll only hurt yourself
Your cause is lost
We know everything
There'll be arrests
There'll be deaths
My employer will seize what remains of this neighborhood
Nothing can stop this
But it is within your power to save many lives  by facilitating the process of transition,  by negotiating the terms of the surrender of Old Town
Son of a bitch
I have suffered your kind before, the dregs of Sin City
I serve a new master now,  and soon you and all your wretched kind will serve him as well
Now, get dressed and shed a tear for Dwight McCarthy if you must,  because, by now, he is surely dead
You don't know him
My man will find a way
He always finds a way
This is a fine, grand country
Low taxes, land of opportunity
Where else would one bullet buy us the fortune that we're getting for this
airports and churches  without shite to show for it
Yeesh
You find something, Murphy
Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge
What's this stuck in it
Bloody hell
It's the bullet
You son of a bitch
Bastard
If they were hired by who I think they were,  the bad times haven't even started yet
And everything seemed to be going so well
Ronnie
Lend me your knife
Should I take a nap while I'm doing all this waiting
I'm at the bone, all right
There we go
Have you ever seen anything so pretty in your whole life
We'll be back for the three of you, and if anyone happens by,  use your imagination, OK
Only the horrid, oily tar taste creeping up my nostrils
Let it fill your lungs
They were counting on you and you blew it
Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist
Miho, you're an angel
You're a saint
You're Mother Teresa
You're God
If you'd shown up ten minutes earlier, we'd still have Jackie Boy's head
Dwight, they got Gail
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob
We gotta find out who it is and rescue Gail
First, we gotta get Jackie Boy's head  before it gets to wherever it's going and this situation blows wide open
I'm not fooling around
We talk
Stay smart
Stay cool
It's time to prove to your friends that you're worth a damn
Sometimes, it means killing a whole lot of people
There they are
We stop 'em, Dallas
is close to me  I could almost reach out and grab it right then and there
Get the head
Get the head
I got it
Suck on this, you stupid slag
if Miho is alive or dead,  but I'm on my feet and every ounce of me wants to get some killing done
So come down and get it
I could've put a bullet straight down your ear just now,  if I hadn't got me revolver all wet and useless
You got the drop on me, love
I got to come clean with you, sweetheart
You see, I'm not too fond of shootin'
It's my preference to blow things up
Once you blast the roof off a pub  and seen all the parts flying off people,  a little bang bang's never gonna match the sight of that
Here's me, with all these fine grenades and such a sweet beauty of a remote
But it's me knife I'll be doing you with
You killed me mates
Someone shoulda told ya: never give an Irishman good cause for revenge
You won't feel a thing unless she wants you to
[crunching]  He feels it
I grab poor Dallas's earphone and make the most important call of my life
First, we gotta rescue Gail, then comes the kill
The big, fat kill
_ [gasping]  [crunching]  Do we just gotta stand here and watch this
I could watch old Manute do his thing all night and not get tired of it
I mean, the man's an artist
Only an artist should be allowed to touch such a beautiful subject
Your skin is perfect
Beautiful
Just give them what they want, Gail
Becky
There's no fighting them
Dwight's dead
They got what's left of that cop we killed
Mob's gonna turn it over to the chief, cops'll mow us down
We gotta cut a deal
You little bitch
I didn't have no choice
They was gonna hurt my mom
You gotta out a deal with these people
It's selfish, you holding out like this
You'll get a lot of girls killed for no good reason
We could have protected her and you know it
It was the money, you stupid little bitch
Sure, there's money
Sure, you could've moved my mom into Old Town  and let her know that her daughter's a goddamn whore
They offered me what you couldn't never offer me: a way out
I had to watch out for my own neck
Your neck
You're crazy
You could have ripped my throat out, you crazy whore
Schutz, fetch my blades
Stuka, kill this one
Stupid little bitch
You deserve worse
I knew there was a reason I got out of bed this morning
Hey
Hey
I don't see nobody
It's right through me
Guys, look
There's something wrapped around it
Some kind of note
[Manute] Give it to me
It's poked right through me
It's starting to hurt
Out back
Everyone
Bring the women
Do you think somebody should call me a doctor or something
Hey
Guys
Oh...   armed to the teeth
I'm outnumbered, outgunned
They can't surround me
Sometimes, you can beat the odds with the careful choice of where to fight
Just give me the woman
[muffled talking]  Shut up
Dwight, don't do this
Wait a minute
Something's not right
Shut up, or I'll plug you
A fair trade
She's all yours
Now, if you'll explain to me why we shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...  Dwight, what have you done
Exactly what I had to
No
It isn't right
There wasn't no tape over his mouth
How come there's tape over his mouth
counts for a lot
But there's nothing like having your friends show up with lots of guns
No
McCarthy, you shit
The girls all know the score
We gotta kill every last rat bastard one of 'em
Not for revenge, not because they deserve it,  not because it'll make the world a better place
We need a heap of bloody bodies  so when mob boss Wallenquist looks over his charts of profits and losses,  he'll see what it cost him to mess with the girls of Old Town
They run out back
Right on schedule
She gets her practice in
The Valkyrie at my side is shouting and laughing  with the pure, hateful, bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,  and so am I
The fire, baby
It'll burn us both
There's no place in this world for our kind of fire,  my warrior woman, my Valkyrie
You'll always be mine
Always... and never.﻿1 Chapter one last stage to red rock  got room for one more
Names major marquis Warren former U.S. calvary
Currentrly I'm a servant of the court
Tryin' to bringin' a coupla' nogoods into market
You takin' 'em into red rock
I figure that's where you headed, right
That damblasted blizzards been on our ass for the last three hours
Ain't no way we gonna make it all the way to red rock 'fore it catches us
So ya' hightailin' it halfway to minnie's haberdashery
May I come aboard
It up to me, yes
But it ain't up to me
Who's it up to
Fella' in the wagon not partial to company
Fella' in the wagon he paid for a private trip
And I'm here to tell ya'..
He paid a pretty penny for privacy
So if you wanna' go to minnie's with us...   You gotta' talk to him
Hold it black fella'
'Fore you approach,  you take them two guns of yours and lay 'em on that rock over yonder
Then you raise both your hands way above your hat
Then you approach...  Molasseslike
Real trustin' fella', huh
Put 'em down
Come on ahead
I said way above your hat, god dammit
Now come forward
That's far enough
I'll be dogged, you black fella' I know
Major marquis Warren
We shared a steak dinner once upon a time in chattanooga
You John Ruth, the hangman
That be me
How longs that been
Since that steak
Eight months
I'm tryin' to get a coupla' of bounty's to red rock
So you still in business
You know I am
Circumstances caused us to take the long way around
My horse couldn't make it
You don't know nothin' about this filly here
Nope
Don't even know your name
Nope
Major marquis Warren, this here is Daisy domergue
Domergue, to you, this is maj. Warren
Howdy nigger
She's a pepper, ain't she
Now girl, don't you know darkee's don't like bein'  called niggers no more
They find it offensive
Now that I can believe
Heard of her
Should I
Well she ain't no John wilkes booth, but...  Maybe you might of heard tell 'bout the price on her head
Ten thousand dollars
Damn, what she do
Kill Lily langtree
Not quite
It's why I ain't too anxious to be handin' out rides
Especially to professionals open for business
Well I certainly can appreciate that
One of my fella's over there is worth four  thousand, one's worth three, and one's worth one
That's damn sure good enough for me
Well...  Let me see their paperwork
Like I said, molasseslike
Back off
Look..
But we gtta' cold damn blizzard,  hot on our asses we tryin' to beat to shelter
I realize that
Okay boy, we'll give it a try
But you leave those pistols over yonder with the driver
You ain't really gonna' let that nigger ridin' in  here is ya'
I mean maybe up there with o.B., but  how you like the sound of them bells, bitch
You open up your trashy mouth again, I'll knock  out them front teeth for ya'
You got it
Yeah
Let me hear you say: "I got it.
I got it
Well, I'm gonna need some help tyin' these fella's up on the roof
Fifty dollars when ya' get to red rock, and he'll help ya'
Well, I agree with o.B
This storm's got me concerned
Goddammit to hell, I'm already regretting this
Now I can't likely help ya' tie fella's to the roof with my wrist cuffed to hers
And my wrist is gonna' stay cuffed to hers, and  she ain't never gonna' leave my goddamn side,  until I personally put her in the red rock jail
Yeah, I got it
Good
Translation/timings/creator by: Deluce  so what happend to your horse
He got old
I done had him for a bit
When the weather took a turn for the worse, he  done what he could, but he couldn't make it
Yes it is
Me an' ole lash rode a lotta' miles together
Never the less..
I'm gonna' miss 'em
Who's Daisy domergue
A no damn good murdering bitch, that's who
I can see you ain't got mixed emotions 'bout bringing a woman to a rope
No I do not have mixed emotions
So you takin' her into red rock to hang
You bet
You know I am
I wanna' hear her neck snap with my own two ears
You never wait to watch 'em hang
My bounties never hang,  cause I never bring 'em in alive
Never
Never ever
Bringing desperate men in alive, is a good way to get yourself dead
I don't wanna' work that hard
No one said the job was suppose to be easy
No one said it was suppose to be that hard, nether
But that little lady,  is why they call him "the hangman"
When the handbill says dead or alive, the rest of  us shoot ya' in the back from up on top of a perch  somewhere, bring ya' in dead over a saddle
When the hangman catches you... You hang
You overrate 'em nigger
I'll give you he got guts
Now Daisy,  I want us to work out a signal system of communication
When I elbow you real hard in the face...  That means: Shut up
You got it
I got it
I..
I know we only met each other once before
And I don't mean to unduly imply intimacy
But...  Well...  You still got it
Of course
Do you got it on you
Where
Right here
I can imagine you probably don't like to take  it in an'out of the envelope all that often
But if you wouldn't mind,  I'd sure appreciate seein' that again
You right,  I don't like taking it in an'out of the envelope that much
Yeah
"Ole Mary Todd's callin', so I guess it must be time for bed"  ole Mary Todd
That gets me
That gets me too
You know what this is, tramp
It's a letter from Lincoln
It's a letter from Lincoln to him
They shared a correspondence during the war
This is just one of the letters
What the...  O.B
Stop
Of all the stupid,  like to rip my goddamn arm off
I didn't,  drag her stikin' ass up this goddamn mountain, just  for you to break her neck on the ouskirts of town
You the one handed her my goddamn letter
I didn't give it to her, I gave it to you
You ruin that letter of his,  that niggers gonna' stomp your ass to death
And when he do,  I'm gonna sit back on that wagon wheel watch and laugh
She didn't help it none
But it's alright
Is that the way niggers treat their ladies
You... ain't no goddamn... lady
Hey mister Ruth
There's another fella' on foot, up here on the road
What
I said, there's another fella' on foot, up here on the road
Considering there's a blizzard goin' on,  whole lotta' fellas walkin' around, wouldn't you say, major
Considerin I'm one half of them fellas, yeah..
Seems to be a lot of 'em
Eight thousand dollars a lotta' money for a nigger
You really think I'm in cahoots wit' that fella'
Or her
Put them on
I ain't wearin' handcuffs
You put those on or you can stop worryin' about this whole thing, right now
Little jumpy, ain't you
Never mind the jokes, just do it
If you say so
I do
Okay..
O.B.
Ya' got 'em
I got 'em
Okay fella',  you keep holdin' that lantern in that one hand,  and you keep that other hand where I can see it
Walk over there where I can get a good look at cha'
I'll be a goddamn dog in the manger
I'm sorry friend, do we know each other
Not quite
You know this fella'
Like I said friend,  you got me at a bit of a disadvantage
Keepin' you at a disadvantage, is a advantage I intend to keep
Whoever you are mister,  you sure sound tough when you're talkin' to a desperate man knee deep in snow
I don't want no trouble
I'm freezin to death
Who is this joker
You heard of the rebel renegade erskine mannix
That's them
The scourge of south Carolina, mannix marauders
That's erskine's youngest boy, Chris
Well Mr. face,  I was riding to red rock and my horse stepped in a gopher hole in the snow,  fucked up his leg, an' had to put 'er down
You got business in red rock
Yes I do
What
I'm the new sheriff
Horseshit
'Fraid not
Once I get there they swear me in, but that ain't happened yet
And that's when you get your star
You got anything that can back any of this up
Yeah
When we get to red rock
And I figure you're taking them three dead bodies into red rock to get paid
Three dead
One alive
Who's that
Who the fuck is Daisy domergue
Not a goddamn thing to nobody, except me and the hangman
The hangman
You're the hangman, Bob Ruth
It's John
And you..
Your're the nigger with the head...  Major marquis
My lord, is that really the real head of major marquis, lookin' at me now
What's goin' on, y'all havin' a bounty hunters picnic
Never mind, you takin' in them three dead bodies  and her to red rock to get paid, ain't ya'
Yeah
Well..
The man is red rock suppose to pay you is me
The new sherrif
So if you wanna get paid, you need to get me to red rock
So I'm suppose to freeze death, 'cause you find something hard to belive
Put them on and come inside
No
Then you'll freeze
Then you'll hang
How so
Driver
I gotta hold these horses I can hear you just fine from up here
You heard me tell this fella' I'm the new sheriff of red rock, right
Red rock is my town
And I'm gonna' enter my town in bounty hunters chains
No sir
Sorry bushwackers, I ain't entering red rock that way
When you finally get to red rock, you're going  to realize every goddamn thing I said was right
And I expect you, o.B.,  to tell the townsfolk of red rock that John  Ruth, let their new sheriff freeze to death
You let me die, that's murder
Hold out your hands
O.B
Give the major back his iron
One thing I know for sure,  this niggerhatin' son of a gun ain't partnered up with you
I'll help protect your eight thousand,  you help me protect my ten,  deal
Ain't love grand
Tell ya' what, Bob  the name's John
When we get to red rock, I'll buy you and major marquis there dinner and booze
May way of sayin' thanks
Well Mr. Ruth,  you sound like you got a axe to grind against the cause
The cause of a renegade army
A bunch of losers gone loco, you bet I do
And this should interest you Warren, imparticular emancipated blacks
Sounds like my kinda' fella'
Sounds to me you been readin' a lotta' newspapers printed in Washington D.C.  Anywho, I'm just tryin' to let y'all know grateful I am
I was a goner, and y'all saved me
Shut up
God damnit, Daisy it's comin'
Here, last piece
Does he know how famous you once was
Black eye
Do you know who he is
Do I know about the thirty thousand dollar reward  the confederacy put on the head of major marquis
Yeah
Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting,  but they never did get 'em the right nigger head, did they
No they didn't
But it wasn't for lack of tryin'
Them peckawoods left their homes and their families, and come to this snowy mountain,  lookin' for me and fortune
The ones you ain't ever heard of no more,  they found me
Once passions had colled, it dropped down to eight, then five
But, I bet even when it was five thousand,  you had your share of country boys comin' to call
You know I did
The confederates took exception to my capacity for killing them
After I broke out of wellenbeck,  the south took my continued existence as a personal affront
So the cause put a reward on my head
What's...  Wellenbeck
No reb, I ain't never heard of it
You bust out
Maj. Marquis did more than bust out
Maj. Marquis had a bright idea
So bright...  You got to wonder, why nobody never thought about it before
Tell John Ruth about your bright idea
Well the whole damn place was just made out of kindling
There was a rookie regiment spendin' the overnight in that camp
Fortyseven men... Burnt to a crisp
I'm suppose to apologize for killin' Johnny reb
You joined the war to keep niggers in chains
I joined the war to kill white Southern  crackers and that means kill 'em anyway I can
Shoot 'em
Stab 'em
Drown 'em
Burn 'em
Whatever it took to put white Southern crackers in the ground  that's what I joined the war to do, and that's what I did
To answer your question, John Ruth,  when major marquis burned forty seven men alive,  for no more a reason then to give a nigger a run for the trees,  that's when the south put a reward on the head of major marquis
And you best belive I ain't look back till I crossed the northern line
But you had a surprise waitin' for you on the northern side, didn't ya'
See once they started pullin' out all the burnt bodies at wellenbeck,  seems not all of them boys were rebs
You burnt up some of your own boys, didn't ya' major
How many burnt prisoners they end up findin'
That's the thing about war mannix,  people die
So ya' chalkin' it up to "war is hell", ha
Well admittedly that's a hard argument to argue with
I think they thought, thirtyseven white men for one nigger  wasn't so hot a trade
I belive they accused you  of being a kill crazy nigger who only joined the war to kill white folks  and the whole blue and grey of it all didn't really much matter to ya'
And that's why they drummed your black ass outta'  the cavalry with a yellow stripe down your back
Isn't it major
Horse shit
I didn't say they could prove it
But they sure did think it out loud, didn't they major
But,  Warren's war record was stellar, and that's what saved his ass
Are you killed yourself your share of  redskins in your day, didn't ya' black major
I'll tell a' what the cavalry didn't look kindly on
Mannix's marauders that's what
And the fact that erskine mannix's little boy  would talk about anybody else's behavior  during war time makes me wanna horse laugh
We weren't foreign barbatians pounding on the city walls
We were your brothers
We deserved dignity in defeat
Just,  how many nigger towns did y'all sack in your fight for dignity in defeat
My faire share, black major
'Cuz when niggers are scared, that's when white folks are safe
No no no, you got me talkin' politics  I didn't wanna'
I..
I think I'll just look out this winda'  let this beatuiful carriage rock me to sleep
And dream about how lucky I am
Easy
What the hell's going on,  we weren't expecting another stage tonight
I can see you already got another one up in here
I just got through putting the horses away
This ain't the normal line
Are minnie and sweet Dave inside
They ain't here
I'm running the place while they're gone
Where's minnie and sweet Dave
He says they ain't here
Who are you
I'm Bob
Well whoever you are, help o.B
With the horses
I just put those other horses away
You need it done fast, you need to help
I got two of my best men on it
Come on let's go
Open up
Kick it open
What
Kick it open
Shut that door, there's a goddamn blizzard out there
You have to nail it shut
There's a hammer and nails by the door
You have to nail it shut
There's a hammer and nails by the door
Give me a hammer
Yeah
You need to do two pieces of wood
Two pieces of wood
That fuckin' thing is busted
Not just one piece of wood
Yeah, allright
Gimme the nail
Here
Jesus
That door's a son of a gun
Good heavens,  a woman  out in this white hell
You must be frozen solid, poor thing
Looks like minnie's got her a full house
About forty minutes ago
The cowboy fella' in the courner, is that your driver
No he's a passenger
The driver lit out
He said he was going to  spend the blizzard shacked up with a friend
Jesus Christ, that's awful
Christ almighty, what that Mexican fella' do, soak his ole socks in the pot
He don't have that problem

Over there
So,  all three of you fellas' headed to red rock, when the blizzard stopped ya', huh
Yes, all three of us were on that stagecouch out there
Over there
Get your hand outta' there
The new sheriff of red rock is traveling with us
Sheriff of red rock, that'll be the day
If he is a goddamn sheriff, I'm a monkey's uncle
Then you can share bananas with your nigger friend in the stable
So..
The new sheriff of red rock is traveling with you
He's just talkin' his self outta' freezin' to death, is all
What the fuck I tell you about talkin', huh
I'll bust you in the mouth right in front of these people, I don't give a fuck
You never gave your name, sir
John Ruth
Are you a lawman
I'm takin' her to the law
That's right, Buster
Do you have a warrant
'Course I do
May I see it
How am I suppose to know,  you're not a villain,  kidnapping this woman without a warrant in your possession
What's your name, Buster
Well..
It certainly isn't Buster
It's oswaldo mobray
Oswaldo
Yes
Well..
I take it you're Daisy domergue
Yeah it's her
It says here, dead or alive
Yeah it does
Wouldn't transporting her be easier  if she were dead
No one said the job was suppose to be easy
Let's just say I don't like to cheat the hangman
He's gotta' make a living too
Well I appreciate that
Allow me to properly introduce myself
I'm oswaldo mobray,  the hangman in these parts
So it would appear
Have you ever spent two days or more locked up with one of your customers
No I can't say I have
Don't talk to my prisoner
I talk to my prisoner, that's it
I got I got
Jolly good
You got anything in here besides coffee that can help warm us up
All right
All right
I'll feed and water the horses
You go inside and get some hot coffy
I've got some stew cooking
Now look...  Now matter how bad this blizzard gets,  we still gotta' feed these horses and take a squat from time to time
So me an' Chris better lay out a line  from the stable to the front door, and from the front door to the shithouse
Okay
Good idea
Come on, Chris
No no no, go inside, get warm
You're doing stable work in a goddamn blizzard, I offer to help and you say no
You're right, mi amigo
All right, follow me
We gonna' drop one, every ten paces
From here to the door
Yeah
All right
Now, you're wanted for murder
For the sake of my analogy, let's just assume that you did it
John Ruth wants to take you back to red rock to stand trail for murder
And as the hangman,  I will perform the execution
And if all those things end up taking place,  that's what civilized society calls "justice"
However,  if the relatives and the loved ones of the person  you murdered were outside that door right now
Now the good part  about frontier justice is it's very thirst quenching
Not in your case
In your case, you'd have it  comin'
But other people, maybe not so much
But ultimately what's the real difference between the two
The real difference is me..
The hangman
To me, it dosen't matter what you did
When I hang you, I  will get no satisfaction from your death
The man who pulls the lever,  that breaks your neck will be a dispassionate man
And that dispassion is the very essence of  justice
For justice delivered without dispassion,  is always in danger of not being justice
Amen
No offense cowboy fella', just gettin' your attention
What'cha writing firend
Only thing I'm qualified to write about
What's that
My life story
You're writing your life story
You bet I am
You just entered
Well you like writing stories so much, why don't  you tell me the story that brings you here
Who's askin'
John Ruth
I'm bringin' in this one to red rock to hang
Ain't no way I'm spendin' a coupla' nights under a  roof with somebody I don't know who you they are
So...  Who are you
Joe gage
What
That's my name, Joe gage
Okay Joe gage, why you goin' to red rock
I ain't goin' to red rock
Where you goin'
What's there
Your mother
Listen, I'm just a cow puncher I just..
I got back from a long drive and..
I wasn't just an ass in a saddle this time,  I was a partner
Now that's funny
'Cuz you don't look like the coming home for Christmas type
Yeah, well...  You know, looks can be deceiving
Because I definitely am a...  Coming home for Christmas to spend time with mother type
Christmas with mother
It's a wonderful thing
Now is that... good enough for you
John Ruth
For now
Just steer clear of my prisoner
Hello old timer
General
You sir,  are a hyena
And I have no wish to speak to you
Fair enough, general
Sorry to bother you
You gonna' kick it open
Kick it open
It dosen't have latch you gonna' hammer up a board
You gotta' nail it shut
The hammer and nails is by the door
Oh god,   holdin' this Chris
Here, here
You need to nail it in
You need two pieces of wood
You gotta' hammer another one
One ain't good enough
It's gotta' open if you don't
Shut up
I got it
Son of a bitch
Jesis Christ, that door's a whore
I get it, haberdashery,  that was a joke
How's the coffy
Now, pretty good, if I do say so myself
Guess who he is
Buffalo bill
Hardly, no
I'm oswaldo mobray, I'm the  he's the hangman of red rock
Well good to meet you Mr.
Mobray
Mobray, I'm Chris mannix,   the new sheriff in red rock
Really
Pay no attention to him
Horseshit
Fella' warmin' himself by the that pot by the stove is a hell of driver named o.B
That's the only thing you said that's the truth
Precisely
Do you have the execution orders on you
In my beg
May I see 'em
Of course
Who's Lance Lawson
He's a fell' been sittin' in the red rock jail about a month now
He's the fella  who shot the fella'  who was sheriff 'fore me
What did she mean when she said,  bounty hunter's nigger friend in the stable
He's got a nigger bounty hunter firend in the stable
I don't think that was the original idea, but...  That's the idea now
Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy
Five of you
Well, well, well, looks like minnie's haberdashery  is about to get cozy for the next few days
Yes it does
Who's the chap with the Lincoln letter
The Lincoln what
President Abraham Lincoln
Weren't you pen pals
With the president
I'm sorry, I heard somebody in your party had a  letter from Abraham Lincoln, I assumed it was you
The black fella' in the stable
The nigger in the stable has a letter from Abraham Lincoln
Yeah
The nigger in the stable has a letter from Abraham Lincoln
Bob
Warren
Minnie and sweet Dave in there
Minnie and sweet Dave went to visit her mother on the north side of the mountain
What
Yeah
Yes, they're visiting her mother
Her mother
I never knew minnie had a mother
Everybody's got a mother
Yeah, I suppose
And she left you in charge
Si
Are you callin' me a liar
Not yet, I ain't
Well first of, minnie never struck me as the sentimental type
Secondly,  I can't imagine sweet Dave liftin' his fat ass  outta' his chair long enough to fetch well water,  unless minnie was layin' a fryin' pan upside his head
Along takin' trips to the north side
That sounds a whole lot like you're calling me a liar, mi negro amigo
Yeah it do sound a whole lot like, don't it
But I still haven't done it yet
Minnie still serve food
Do you consider stew food
Then we serve food
She still stinkin' up the place with her "old quail" pipe tobacco
Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe
"Red apple tobacco"  but mi negro amigo, I think you already know this
Just seein' if you do
Fill me up, o.B
Yeah
Goddamn it
Thank you
Well cut my legs off and call me shorty...  Is that genaral sanford smithers I see
You've got a good eye son
General Sandy "don't give a damn" smithers
Captain Chris mannix, mannix marauders
Erskine's boy
Yes sir
May I sit down, sir
Genaral Sandy smithers..
Boy...  Oh boy
Did my daddy talk about you
Me and my boys did our part
Just like erskine and his boys did their part
Yankees sons of bitches
I never knew your father, son
But, I always respected his resolve
Thank you for saying that, general
Your respect woulda' meant the world to him
Can I get ya' some coffy
Well, how about a blanked
That would be even nicer
Hell, you know what, you can have mine
So what brings you out Wyoming way, sir
If ya' don't mind me askin'
My boy
You gotta' boy that lives in red rock
Forgive me sir
No forgiveness needed, son
Like I said, it was a few years back
It was after he served his service
He came out here to the hills of Wyoming,  to make his fortune
I bought him a symbolic plot  in the red rock cemetery
I'm here to advise the stone maker on his headstone
Was he a goner fer' sure
It's a rough life, but folks can learn it
If he had done what he came here to do,  he'd a come home
Close it, close it
You have to hold it closed while I nail it shut
Really
Who's the idiot who broke the damn door
Okay
Hold it, mi negro amigo
We need two pieces of wood
Ola mi cabron
That's a lotta' hats, senor Bob
Huh
Which,  if I remember it correctly, that was one of them bar of iron rules,  kinda rule, she'd want kept up in her absence
You seem to have a laissez faire attitude when it comes to the hats
I'm guilty
I have a laissez faire attitude about the hats
How about we forget about the hats today,  considering there's a blizzard going on and all,  and make tomorrow "no hat day"
Labrador
Always said that Davis was a courages man
But he should have put capital in Montgomery and not Richmond
Yes, sir
I agree with that the army in north Virginia would've been used in a..
Shut up
O.B.
Do you know that nigger, sir
I don't know that nigger
And that's all I need to know
Well that nigger just ain't any nigger
That nigger is  general sanford smithers
Battle of Baton Rouge
Major nigger, general smithers wishes me to inform you..
I heard 'em hillbilly
Inform this old cracker that I was in Baton Rouge also
On the other side
General smithers, he said that he was also in Baton Rouge
On the other  cap't mannix, tell the nigger,  that I don't acknowledge niggers in northern uniforms
You captured a whole colored command that day
But not one colored trooper made it to a camp, did they
Nor the inclination to care for northern horses,  and least of all northern niggers
So we shot 'em where they stood
Gentlemen,  gentlemen,  I know Americans aren't apt  to let a little thing like an unconditional surrender get in the way of a good war
But I strongly suggest we don't restage the battle of Baton Rouge,  during a blizzard in minnie's haberdashery
Now, my nubian friend,  while I realize passions are high, that was a while ago
And if you shoot this unarmed old man I guarantee  I will hang you by the neck until you are dead
Once we arrive in red rock
Yeah Warren, that's the problem with old men
You can kick 'em down the stairs and say it's  a accident, but ya' can't just shoot 'em
Gentlemen, since we may be trapped here,  close together like for a few days,  may I suggest a possible solution
We divide minnie's in half
With the dinner table  operating as a neutral territory
We could say that the fireplace side of the room,  acts as a symbolic representative of...  Georgia  while the bar, represents...  Philadelphia
As long aas the bar's Philadelphia I agree
We still got that deal we talked about in the wagon
I help you protect your eight thousand, you help me protect my ten
What is he
He's in cahoots with this one that's what he is
One of them, maybe even two of 'em, is here to see domergue goes free
And to accomplish that goal, they'll kill everbody in here
So all they gotta' do  is sit tight and wait for a winda' of opportunity
And that's when they strike,  huh bitch
If you say so, John
Are you sure you're not just being paranoid
He won't have the leather patience it takes to just sit here and wait
But waiting for an oportunity, and knowing it's the right one, isn't so easy
He'll try and create his opportunity
And that's when mr. Jumpy reveals himself
What do I got to say
About John Ruth's ravings
He's absolutely right
Me and one of them fella's is in cahoots
And  we're just waitin' for everybody go to sleep
That's when we gonna' kill y'all
This here is Daisy domergue
She's wanted dead or alive for murder
Ten thousand dollars
Don't wanna' share it
I ain't gonna' lose it
When the sun comes out, I'm taking this woman into red rock, to hang
Now...  Is there anybody here...  Comitted to stopping me'...  From doing that
Nobody gotta' problem with this
Well, I guess that's very fortunate for me
However, I hope you all understand,  I can't just take your word
Circumstances force me to, take...  Precautions
When you say precautions...  Why do I feel you mean me
You are
Yes I am
Just mine
The hangman got himself a gun too
I'll be dealing with his gun after I deal with yours
I feel kinda' naked without it
Oh, I still got mine
A bastards work is never done, huh, John Ruth
That's right, Joe gage
Now gimmie the gun
You want it
You have to come and take  calm down
Take your hand away from your gun
Did he blink
He blinked
Blink if your gonna' remain calm
He blinked
Take his pistol
Like I said, nothing personal
Pretty sneaky
I'm afraid the same applies to you too, Mr.  Mobray
Precautions must be taken because life is too sweet to lose
Hand me that little bucket
Go to the outhouse
Take this bucket and dump it down the shit hole
Why do I gotta' go outside
Your jacket's already on
And I sorta kinda trust you
After you major
Okay
Don't get any ideas, I ain't goin' soft on ya'
You lift your ass even one inch off this seat,  I'll put a bullet right in your goddamn throat
You don't hear me complaining do ya'
No I sure don't
How about me what
Look,  considerin' all the thing I done for money, I ain't one to judge
But don't you feel just the least little bad 'bout hangin' a woman
Till they invent a trigger a woman can't pull, if  you're a hang man, you're going to hang woman
Well hell ozzy, I guess I ain't never looked at it like that before
When it comes to some of them mean bastards  out therem it's the only thing does the job
You really only need to hang mean bastards
You goddamn son of a bitch
I almost died out there
I ain't never going out in that shit ever, ever again
I'm fine
I'll be fine
I just need to get warm
You want some stew, o.B.
Stew, later
That's nice
Leave me be from your horseshit
John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln letter
I tole' you jackass to heehaw somewhere else
That's right, John
Yeah I did
So...   You got a letter from Abraham Lincoln
Yes
Thee Abraham Lincoln
Yes
Yes
Of America
Yes
Wrote you a letter, personally
Yes
Personally
No
Personally as in: "Dear marquis"
"Dear marquis" Abraham Lincoln the president of the United States of America
May I see it
No you may not
But the way John tells it, you weren't just some  random nigger soldier picked from a pile of letters
Way John tells it,   y'all hada' correspondence
Yes
Way John tells it, y'all's practically pen pals
And a pen pal's..
John Ruth,  you really think a nigger drummed outta' the  calvary with a yellow stripe down his back,  was practically friends with the president of the United States of America
John Ruth, I hate to be the one to break it to ya' but nobody in minnie's haberdashery,  had ever corresponded with Abraham Lincoln,  least of all, that nigger there
Was all that horseshit
Course it was
Well I guess it's true what they say about you people
You can't trust a fuckin' word that comes outta' your mouth
I hurt your feelings
As a matter of fact, you did
But you got no idea, what it's like being a black man facin' down America
The only time black folks are safe,  is when white folks is disarmed
And this letter,  had the desired effect of disarming white folks
Call it what you want,  I call it a dirty fuckin' trick
You wanna' know why I'd lie about something like that, white man
Well I'll tell you like the lord tole' John,  a letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't have that kinda' effect on me
I might let a whore piss on it
I spit on it
Warren goddamit, you leave that old man alone
Stand down you son of a bitch, I shared a battle field with this man
Or would you deny me that too
I suppose you were there
May I join you
Damn it
So,  how's life since the war
Got both my legs
Got both my arms
I can't complain
Got a woman
What was her name
Betsy
Georgia girl
Augusta
I use to raise Kentucky horses
Her paw' was the owner of the breedershit where I brought of my ponies
I made good deal on her
Took the stake he gave and bought a bunch peach ochards
Set myself up pretty well
Did a hellva' lot better than my no good brothers, that's for damn sure
He spoke highly of his mama too
You knew my boy
Yeah...  Yeah I knew 'em
You did not know my boy
Suit yourself
Didja' know my son
No
The day he met me
He came up here to do a little nigger head huntin'
By then the reward was so, five thousand and bragging rights
But back then to battle hard rebs, five thousand just to cut off a niggers head,  now that's good money
So the Johnny's climbed this mountain, lookin' for fortune
But there was no fortune to be found
All they found was me
"If you just let me home to my family, I'll  swear, I'll never set foot in Wyoming again.
That's what they all said
Beggin' for his life
Your boy told me his whole life story
And you was in that story, general
And when I knew me I had the son
Of the bloody nigger killer of Baton Rouge..
I knew me I was gonna' have some fun
General smithers, don't you listen to him, he didn't know your boy
He just heard, tell why you here is all
It was cold the day I killed your boy
And I don't mean snwoy mountain in Wyoming cold
And on that cold day,  with your boy at the business end of my gun barrel..
I made him strip
Then I told him to start walkin'
I walked his naked ass for two hours, 'fore his cold collapsed him
You never even knew my boy
No he didn't
He's just a sneaky nigger tryin' to getcha to go for that gun
Then he commits to begging again
He knew he'd never see his home again
And he wasn't beggin' for his life neither
'Cos he knew that was long gone
Now don't judge your boy too harshly, general
You'd be surprised what a man that cold, would do for a blanket
Wanna know what your boy did
I took my big, black, pecker outta' my pants
And I made him crawl through the snow on all fours over to it
Then I grabbed a hand full of that black hair on the back his head...  Then I stuck my big, black Johnson right down his goddamn throat
And it was fulla' blood, so it was warm
And Chester Charles smithers,  sucked on that warm black dingus for long as he could
Starting to see pictures, ain't ya'
Your boy...  Black dudes dingus in his mouth
Him shakin', him cryin'  me laughin'  and him not understandin'  but you understand, doncha' Sandy
I never did give your boy that blanket
Even after all he did, and he did everything I asked
That blanket was just a heart breakin' liar's promise
Kinda' like those uniforms the union issued those colored troopers,  that you chose not to acknowledge
So what you gonna' do old man
You gonna' spend the next two or three days,  ignore the nigger that killed your boy,  ignoring how I made him suffer
He was your boy
Chapter four domergue's got a secret  about fifteen minutes has passed, since we last left our characters
Joe gag volunteered to take smithers dead body outside
Straws we drawn to see who would help him...  O.B
Lost
Chris, John Ruth and oswaldo,  had vigorous debate about the legality of selfdefense murder they just transpired
Captain Chris mannix dawn the dead generals coat and  joined oswaldo in lighting the candles and lanterns
Hey ozzy, hey you got the right idea
Let's light this place up
To return
Bob enjoyed an manzana roja
Domergue, however,  hasn't moved from her spot at the community dinner table since John Ruth uncuffed her
Can I play that guitar over there
Let's go back a bit
Your boy, black dudes dingus in his mouth
Fifteen minutes ago major Warren shot general smithers in front of everybody
But fourty seconds before that, something equally  as important happened, but not everybody saw it
While major Warren was captivating the crowd  with tales of black dicks and white mouths...  Somebody... poisoned the coffy
He did everything I asked, no blanket
And the only one to see 'em do it...  Was domergue
John Ruth
Yeah
Can I play that guitar over there
Yeah
My pistol plays a tune
Domergues death march, you got it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's the one you like to sing in the stagecoach, huh
Yeah
It's kinda' pretty
Got another verse to it
Yeah I got
Music time's over
Turn around
No, no, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up
When you get to hell, John
Tell 'em Daisy sent ya'
Mannix the coffy
Gimme that fucking gun
Don't test me, bitch
Goddammit  get or don't get, Joe gage
It's up to you
I'll get
Then get
Everybody turn around and put your hands on that wall
Move 'em down snowshoes
Everybody keep your mouth shut and do like I say
You open your mouth; You gonna' get a bullet
You move a little sudden, a little strange; You gonna' get a bullet
Not a warning, not a question; A bullet
You got that
"I got it"
"I got it"  "I got it"
We have it
Come on
Take this gun out of my holster
Point it at them
Like I said, anybody does anything
Kill 'em
So...  You finally decided I'm tellin' the truth 'bout bein' the sheriff of red rock, huh
I don't know 'bout all that
But you ain't the killer who poisoned that coffy
But one of 'em is
Gimme the key
You motherfucking black bastard
You're gonna' die on this mountain and I'm gonna' fucking laugh when you do
What I say 'bout talkin
'Meant it, didn't I
And you need to understand, you just killed the only  man here, comitted to gettin' you to red rock alive
Now, one of y'all... Is workin' with her
Or all y'all is..
But only one of you poisoned the coffy
So what charms this bitch got, take a man brave a blizzard,  kill in cold blood, I'm sure I don't know
But o.B
Wasn't hangin' nobody
He damn sure would
But he sure enough led over there dead now, though, ain't he
Just like any one of us who'd drank that coffy
Like me god damnit
Now those of y'all with your hands on the wall  don't practice in poison need to think about that
Think about how that coulda' you been you rollin' around on this floor
And I know who I got my money on
Yeah that's right Joe gage I'm lookin' at you
Not so fast Chris
We'll get there
Let's slow it way down
Who made the coffy
He did
Yeah, he did, didn't he
Yeah, he did, didn't he
But it's the stew that's got me thinking
A week
Si
See, my mama used to make stew
And it always tasted the same, no matter the meat
He made stew too and like my mama's
I ate his stew from the time I was a whipper,  to I was a full grown man
And no matter the meat, it always tasted like uncle charly's stew
Now I ain't had minnie's stew in six months, so I ain't no expert, but that,  damn sure is minnie's stew
And this
When I sat in it earlier, I couldn't belive it
Nobody sits in sweet Dave's chaire
This may be minnie's place, but this is damn sure,  sweet Dave's chair
I'm pretty goddamn sure that chair's be going with him
What's in the chair
Just what I thought
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood
So...  Are you actually accusing me of murder
The way I see it, senior Bob,  whoever's workin' with her,  ain't who they say they is
They're lyin' out back there dead somewhere
Or if it's you britisch man,  the real oswaldo mobray is lyin' in a ditch somewhere
And  you're just an English fella' passin' off his papers
Or we go by my theory, which is the ugliest guy did it
So I take it you've deduced the coffy was  poisoned while you were murdering the old man
Yes
Well, mi negro amigo, during that whole incident..
Playing silent night on the piano
I didn't say you poisoned the coffy
I said you didn't make the stew
My theory is...  You're working with man who poisoned the coffy
And both of y'all murdered minnie,  and sweet Dave and whoever else picked this bad luck  day to visit minnie's haberdashery this morning
And at some point, y'all intented to bushwhack John Ruth and free Daisy
That's as far as I got
How am I doin'
Your a real imaginative nigger, ain't you
So, do you intend to murder me based on a far fetched nigger theory
It ain't so far fetched, senior Bob
And it's a little bit more then my theory
How long you say you been working for minnie's
Four months
Minnie mentioned that to you
No
You know what that sign said, senior Bob
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed"  minnie hung that sign up the day she opened this habadashery
You know why she took it down
She started lettin' in dogs
Now minnie likes just about everybody, but she sure don't like Mexicans
So when you tell me, minnie went to north side to visit her mama
Well I find that highly unlikely... but okay  maybe
Well that's what I meant in the barn when I said: "That sure don't sound like minnie"
Now I am calling you a liar, senior Bob
And if you lyin, which you are,  then you killed minnie  and sweet Dave
That still don't get us no closer...  To which one of y'all poisoned the coffy, though
Does it Chris
No it sure don't
Now one of y'all poisoned this coffy, to free Daisy
Okay, time's up
Stop
Alright I did it, it was me I poisoned the coffy
I fuckin' knew it
Major Warren please let me sent this ugly son of a bitch to hell
You killed o.B
He's worth ten of you
Say adios to your huevos
Major Warren
Chapter five the four passengers  earlier that morning
Hey charly my, how the hell are you
Hi ya' Ed, hi ya' Judy   how many ya' got
Full house today, friend
We got on in there waiting
Well he's gonna' hafta keep on waitin' cause we ain't got no room
Well you need to tell minnie
Cause he's been  here two days and minnie wants him outta here
Warm youself up and drink some coffy
Okay
Step outside you and your friends can stretch  your legs
When you're reday, stop on inside,  get warm by the fire, get some coffy in you
I'll introduve you to minnie
Hi minnie
I'm not trying to tell you how to run your business
But I would think coffy would be the first thing you'd make
Hats
Everybody, this is minnie, and this is her place
Behind me pluckin' that chicken is Gemma
Now the fella' in the uniform I don't know but  the one he's playing chess with is sweet Dave
Hey Judy
And minnie, these are the passengers
Well that's not good enough
Go take away them rags, let's see some faces let's hear some names
Oswaldo mobray, madame
Bob
And I'm Jody
It's a pleasant surprise to find such a warm  sanctuary in the middle of such a cold hell
Well make yourself comfortable
Get warm by the fire
We're just gonna' go warm ourself's by the stove, if that's all right
Just get warm
Yes I do belive Judy did say something about the best coffy in the world
Well I don't know 'bout all that
But I'll tell ya what it is
It's hot and it's strong and it's good
And  in this snow it sure 'nuff warms your ass up
You don't need to sell it, minnie, you need make it
And you need to get your ass out there and  help charly with them bags and get Ed in here
I'll fix you
I don't know some old man
Well I don't know what I'm suppose to do about it
I'm just tellin' you what she said
Anyway she sent me out here to help charly, she wants to talk to you
Would you roll me a cigarette
Sure honey, I smoke red apple tobacco, that all right
It's my favorite
Don't mind me gentlemen, I'm just watching
You know, I must of had at least twelve people,  teach me that goddamn game
Just never could keep the moves in my head
But if I'm not disturbing, I like to watch
Hell no
I like whippin' this old man's ass in front of a audience,  you ain't whippin' shit
Merci beaucoup mademoiselle, minnie
Oh that's real nice, what is that
It's French
Oui   oui  what is that mean
It means yes
Hey Dave, ask me if my ass is fat
What
Ask me if my ass is fat
It is
I said ask me
Why
Is your ass fat
Oui, look at that y'all I can speak French
How many peppermint sticks I get for a nickel
Five
All right
Here
Thank you sugar
Allow me to assist you, madame
Peppermint stick
Thanks
So why do they call you six horse Judy anyway
Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever seen that could drive a six horse team
Hell yeah, kinda of a stupid question
Could you holding this for me
Rock steady, madame
You gotta' very sweet accent, where that from, England
I take exception to that
New zeeland
Carefull, madame
Auckland, what the fuck is an Auckland
Coffy's ready
It's about damn time
Best coffy on the mountain
I'll don't know 'bout all that
Stagecoach drivers like it
Most find it a mite too strong
Can't be too strong on this mountain, thank you
Well, what'd ya' think
Shit
He adds something, not much, but something
What do you think, Pete
Well I must admit, he does make the set up more convincing
And then start unhitching the horses and get 'em in the barn and get 'em fed
To drag these fat bastards up and down the mountain that's fucking impossible, mate
Look I just started working here
Whatever minnie to make y'all mad
I had nothing to do with it
Well old man,  if you was a cat what just happened here  would count as one of your nine lives
You realize how close you came to being tossed on a pile of niggers
Yes
You believe that
I expect no less
Not so fast old man
You might have a way out of this yet
And he's gonna have my sister with him,  and he's gonna have her in chains
He's taking her into red rock to be hung
No
Ten thousand dollars
And when he get's here
I'm gonna' kill that fella' and turn my sister lose
Now do you have any reason why you'd want to interfere  with me saving my sister from a hangman's rope
No
You don't
You sure you don't
I mean we did just kill minnie and sweet Dave
You and sweet Dave seemed pretty chummy over here
I just met these people
I don't give a damn about them, or you, or your sister,  or any other son of a bitch in Wyoming for that matter
That is a good answer, old man
And you don't do nothin'
You don't say nothin'
Hello, thank you, good night, that's about it
Maybe your name, but that's it
Maybe my name
Be an old man, be dotty
Go to sleep
And don't you say nothin' and I mean nothin'  to that bounty hunter that's got my sister
Yes
When it's safe I kill him, free my sister and leave you be
Deal
During the next four hours, Jody and the boys Chuck the bodies down the well
Put away the horses
Tidied around minnie's
Stash weapons for further use
Here they come
Okay boys, this is it, get ready
Let's get ready
Now remember, it dosen't matter if we have four men or fory,  we're still gonna' be facing John Ruth chained  to my sister with a pistol pointed at her belly
Now killin' that fella' 'fore he kills my sister, ain't gonna' be easy
But you believe that's exactly what we're gonna do
Trapped here for two or three days, at some point, he will close his eyes  and that's when you blow the top of his head off
Remember old man, my sister don't make it off this mountain alive, neither do you
I'll do my best
What the hell's going on, we weren't expecting another stage tonight
I can see you already got another one up in here
I just got through putting the horses away
But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,  so it looks like you're stuck with us
I can do another one
They ain't here
I'm running the place while they're gone
Where's minnie and sweet Dave
He says they ain't here
He's lookin' after the place while they gone
Who are you
I'm Bob
With the horses
I just put those other horses away
You need it done fast, you need to help
I got two of my best men on it
You heard him freeloaders, get to work
Come on let's go
You have to kick it open
What
Kick it open
Last chapter black man, white hell  how you doin' old boy
They shot my nuts off they're freezin'  burining up the same time, bleedin like a stuck pig
I think I'm gonna die
And these motherfuckers did it
How you doin'
Well my leg hurts really bad
But I think if I'm put all my weight on my right foot  I'm just bein' sarcastic I don't give a fuck about your leg
Don't worry about my comfort
Shit
I can't feel my ass no more
Worry about these owl hoots and that bushwhacker nuts shooter in the basement
All right
Fella' in the basement
You either give up by the time I count to three,  or I shoot domergue in the head
One!..
No, no, no, no
I'm comin' up
Hold on there you bushwhacker sack shooter, you  just open the door we tell you to come up
Now throw out your pistol
Throw it to the bed
Well he got another
Now throw out your other pistol
I ain't got another pistol
Cause if you don't throw one up here in the next two seconds we gonna' kill this bitch
See
Told ya'
Now...  With your hands where we can see 'em..
How ya' doin' dummy
Better now I see your ugly face
How you like you that
You bushwhacker castrator
It took him too long so I done for him
Joe gage get your ass over and shut this trap door
I'm sorry, honey
May I sit in the chair
Yes you may
And don't move 'em
You sure picked the wrong time to turn into a nigger lover
Don't you see that nigger and John Ruth put you smack dab in the middle of danger
You're about to be murdered in some nigger named  minnie's house and you don't even know why
Okay, bitch..
I'll bite... why
But not cause they got butterflies in their belly 'bout me
But because we're all gang members, the Jody domergue gang
That fella' y'all just killed in the basement, was Jody domergue, my brother
Well who the hell, is Jody domergue
You wanna tell 'em bounty man
He's worth fifty thousand dollars
And every member of his gang is wort at least ten
And what's gonna' happen when that sun comes  out nigger, so is my brother's fifteen men  comin' straight here for us
Tell 'em grouch
Jody's got fifteen men waitin' in red rock
If we couldn't kill John Ruth and free Daisy here
Their job was to sack the town, kill John Ruth and free Daisy there
Oh yeah
And Chris I'm tellin' you, you ain't done anything yet, we can't forgive
So...   Let's make a deal
No deals, bitch
You gonna' let that nigger speak for you, Chris
Seein' as she ain't got nothin' to sell, I'm  kinda curious about her sales pitch, humor me
All right, bitch
Easy
Take your gun, shoot that nigger dead
Then we sit here all nice like for the next two days
Well... we can give 'em Marco
Bob's real name is "Marco the Mexican"
He's worth twelve thousand dollars
That's "Marco the Mexican"
Precisely, yeah
Sheeit, after I blew his face off, Marco ain't worth a peso
If I die in the next two days, which is more than likely, you can have me
And it's all your Chris
You keep talkin', Pete
You gonna talk yourself to death
Grouch douglass
You heard of him
Yeah, I heard of grouch douglass
He's worth ten, just like Daisy
Remind me,  why we wouldn't just kill all y'all and cash in
Oh, you can kill us all
Because when that snow melts, the rest of Jody's  gang  all fifteen of 'em that were waiting,  in red rock are comin' here
Now let, let's say you shoot us all..
If you really want all that domergue gang bounty money,  you still got to get all our corpses into red rock
And that ain't gonna' be so easy
And that wagon out there is too heavy for a two horse team
So that means you're gonna' hafta' lead a string of horses into red rock  and with that deep snow after a blizzard,  you ain't gonna' be able to get away with any more then let's say one body per horse
So that's you, leading a string of four horses into red rock,  and with all them horses, in that snow,  and you all by your lonesome, you're gonna be a mite poky
And you gonna' run smack dab into the domergue  gang and agin grouch, how many is that
And when those fifteen killers,  come across you,  in possession of all of our dead bodies, they  ain't just gonna' kill you and that nigger
There gonna go back to red rock and kill every son of a bitch in that town
You really the sheriff of red rock
Then shoot that nigger dead
Well good 'cos 'bout meet him
Anybody else wanna' make a deal, huh
The deal still stands, Chris
You ain't done we can't forgive
It's still all on that nigger
Shoot 'em dead, take my body  and sit out the snow with Daisy and grou  mannix
Catch 'em here
Catch 'em here
So...  You were sayin'... We sit here...  All nice and friendly like...  For the next two days...  Then the snow melts,  you leave here, meet up with your gang and high tail it to Mexico
Yeah
And I get oswaldo and Joe gage
But Jody's worth fifty thousand, what 'bout his body
I'm not sayin' I'm gonna' make a deal with her, we're just talkin'
Calm down
So what about Jody's body and the fifty thousand
You've gotten greedy, reb, no deal
We take Jody's body back with us he got children
Yeah
No deal, tramp
Chris you're makin' the biggest mistake of your life
When our boys get here in a coupla' days, their gonna cut your nuts off
And there won't be a stick left in that town unburnt
Well I guess I should be plum scared right now, huh
If you had any brains, you would be
Here's the problem Daisy
In order for me to be scared of your threats,  I got to believe in those fifteen extra gang members waitin' it out in red rock
And boy, oh boy..
I sure don't
And you watched me pork up and didn't say shit...  And I believe...  You all what you've always been...  A lyin' bitch, who will do anything...  To cheat that rope waitin' for her in red rock
Including shittin' out fifteen extra gang members,  whenever you needs be
And..
I believe when it comes to what's left of the Jody Doeminggrey gang..
Dead on this on this motherfuckin' floor
Goddamn right
My brother leds an army of men  horse shit
My daddy led an army, he led a renegade amry, fightin' a lost cause
My daddy held up to four hundred men together after the war  with nothing but their respect in his command
Your brother's just a owl hoot who led a gang of killers
Oh, shit
You still alive, white boy
Mannix
Fuck
Hey, boy
Chris mannix
Wake the fuck up
Wake up, white boy
I ain't dead yet, you black bastard
Chris mannix, I may have misjudged you
No, no, no don't shoot her
Why the hell not
John Ruth
John Ruth was one mighty, mighty bastard
Was save your life
We gonna' die, white boy
We ain't got no say in that
But there's one thing left we do have a say in
And that how we kill this bitich
And I say, shootin's to good for her...  John Ruth coulda shot her anywhere, anytime along the way,  but John Ruth was the hangman...  And when the hangman catches ya', you don't die by no bullet
When the the hangman catches ya'...  You hang
"You only need to hang mean bastards.
As my first and final act as the sheriff of red rock,  I sentence you, domergue,  to hang by the neck until dead
Hang on, Daisy
Now that, was a nice dance
That sure was pretty
Hey...  Can I see that Lincoln letter
I hope this letter finds you..

I'm doing fine...  Altough I whish there were more hours in the day...  Is just so much to do...  Time's changing slowly..
