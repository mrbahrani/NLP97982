label1 ﻿1 Hold on
label1 I gotta come up
label1 We can't be late
label1 We won't
label1 Who's holding
label1 We were kind of hoping you were
label1 Yeah
label1 How are you not holding
label1 Jesus Christ, Shanna
label1 It is not my fucking job to supply y'all with weed when we go out
label1 You're getting angry kind of quick, don't you think
label1 I was just teasing you
label1 I'm not angry
label1 It just would be nice if y'all didn't just count on me all the fucking time,  and surprise me every once in a while with pot
label1 Okay, mean girl in a high school movie
label1 I'm not having a tantrum
label1 Yes, you are
label1 You've been in the car all of two seconds, and you're already cursing at me
label1 I am not cursing at you
label1 You said, "Jesus Christ, Shanna.
label1 Come on, guys
label1 Don't fight
label1 I'll pay for it when we get some
label1 One: It is not about the money
label1 And two: We're not really fighting
label1 Arlene, have you forgotten what hanging out with Jungle Julia's like
label1 That wasn't a fight
label1 That was Julia acting like a grumpy bitch,  and me calling her on it and indulging her at the same time
label1 That's how we tolerate each other after all these years
label1 Oh, billboard
label1 Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's
label1 Did you call Rafael and tell him we're coming
label1 Of course
label1 You're so good
label1 I know
label1 You bet your ass he is
label1 Christian Simonson, the filmmaker, is in town
label1 He's got a big thing for Julia
label1 If he had a big thing for me, he'd fucking call me  as opposed to disappearing for six months,  and he'd get his ass down here more often than he does,  and on my birthday, give me a fucking phone call
label1 Oh, billboard
label1 Yeah, but you get those legs of yours around him, and it's all over
label1 So, margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's, touch base with Chris and Jesse,  tell them about later, and make damn sure they come
label1 Those other guys will be waiting for us to join them at the Texas Chili Parlor
label1 Oh, shit
label1 Speaking of which, what happened with you and Nate last night
label1 Well, you know, not mu... We just fucking met each other
label1 I mean, if you don't bust their balls a little bit, they're never gonna respect you
label1 How about enlightening us on what it is you did do
label1 Nothing to write home about
label1 We just made out on the couch for about 20 minutes
label1 Dressed, halfdressed or naked
label1 I said we made out
label1 We didn't do the thing
label1 Excuse me for living, but what is "the thing"
label1 You know, it's everything but
label1 I call it "the thing.
label1 Do guys like the thing
label1 Okay, I wanna get back to what it is you did do
label1 So, you're making out on the couch with Nate, right
label1 Correct
label1 His or the one in your hotel room
label1 What am I, stupid over here
label1 Mine
label1 Were you making out sitting up or lying down
label1 We started sitting up
label1 We worked our way to lying down
label1 Who was on top
label1 I was straddling him
label1 What else
label1 That was it
label1 So we made out for a little while on the couch,  and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now, so it's time for you to leave.
label1 And I said, "Yep, right now
label1 Let's go.
label1 what about this?
label1 And I said, "No.
label1 He said, "What do you mean, no
label1 I said, "I already know what you're gonna say,  and the answer's no.
label1 He said, "How can you say you know what I'm gonna say?
label1 I said, "Because you're gonna say, 'let's just go to sleep together
label1 "'We don't gotta do nothing
label1 "'Just cuddle, sleep next to each other, wake up in the morning together.
label1 No, you're gonna leave, but I'll see you tomorrow.
label1 Yeah, fuck Nate
label1 I mean, he's cute and all,  but Jesse Letterman's gonna be all over her
label1 Remember, no hooking up tonight
label1 You can hang out with him, you can make out with him,  but no hooking up with him, because we are driving to Lake LBJ tonight,  and my daddy's pretty clear about one thing
label1 Your dad talks like that
label1 Hell, yeah
label1 It's not like he ain't gonna know, either,  because when I'm staying at the lake house with my girlfriends in our bikinis,  Daddy just has a tendency to pop up and make sure we don't need anything
label1 Look, he's totally harmless and cute as a bug's ear
label1 But, you know, when he's got a bunch of halfnaked poontang  walking the floor of his lake house,  he just likes to pay us a visit and make sure we got everything we need
label1 And if you flirt shamelessly with him, like the sixfoot baby giraffe in the backseat,  you got a puppy dog for life
label1 You call her dad Ben
label1 I'm not a child
label1 That's his name
label1 They're gonna meet us at the Chili Parlor
label1 Fuck that
label1 No
label1 I don't wanna be either A, depending on their fucking ass,  or B, depending on their ass
label1 Uhuh
label1 We don't score ourselves,  we're gonna be stuck with them all fucking night
label1 Ooh, try Lanna Frank
label1 Best idea you had all day
label1 Oh, hey, that's your last billboard before Guero's
label1 Give me a break
label1 We said every time
label1 Okay
label1 Jules, let me get a drag
label1 Thanks
label1 Hey, this is... and I's U.T
label1 days, Arlene
label1 Hey
label1 Hey
label1 For a second, but I'm with some friends
label1 Oh
label1 So you must be... must be..
label1 Shh
label1 She don't know nothing about it
label1 Know about what
label1 When were y'all gonna tell her
label1 Soon
label1 Tell me what
label1 All right, cut the shit
label1 What the fuck is going on
label1 I said a little somethin'somethin' about you on the air today
label1 All I said was I had a sexy friend named Butterfly  who was in from out of town for the weekend,  and we would be going out somewhere in Austin tonight,  and if they were out on the town, maybe they'd see us
label1 And I described you, and I said that if they spotted you while we were out,  if they'd do something, you'd do something
label1 Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious
label1 What did you say, and what did you say I'd do
label1 Anyhoo, I could explain what I said, which would be boring,  or Marcy over here,  who is an incredible actress, could act it out for you,  which, I think, will give you a better idea  of what you have in store for you tonight
label1 Okay, so just tell me your way
label1 So we'll act it out with Marcy
label1 Okay, give Marcy your drink
label1 Thank you
label1 Okay, so, you're in a club or a bar,  and Marcy's a kind of cute or kind of hot or kind of sexy  or better be fucking hysterically funny, but not funnylooking guy  who you could fuck
label1 Got it
label1 Hi there
label1 Excuse me, but your name wouldn't be Butterfly, would it
label1 Yes, it is
label1 It seems you have me at a disadvantage
label1 Barry
label1 Pleased to meet you, Barry
label1 Y'all are getting me hot
label1 So, is, uh, Butterfly your real name
label1 Yes, it is
label1 And how'd you know my name, Barry
label1 I listened to Jungle Julia's show this morning
label1 Oh, yeah
label1 I listen to her show every morning
label1 Oh, you do, do you
label1 She's, like, the coolest lady in town
label1 Don't you think she's got a big ass
label1 I like her ass that way
label1 She got a black girl's ass
label1 Well, that's what she always says, but, natural fact,  she doesn't really have a black girl's ass
label1 She's got a big ass
label1 Okay, what the fuck are you doing
label1 Oh, look who wants to get to the point all of a sudden
label1 Okay, we'll get to the point
label1 I don't wear their teeth marks on my butt for nothing
label1 No
label1 Okay, okay, okay, okay
label1 So, Butterfly, can I buy you a drink
label1 I'd love one
label1 I'll take a margarita
label1 Here you go
label1 So, after they buy you a drink,  when they raise their glass to toast,  they look you dead in the eye  and repeat this poem:  "The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  "and I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep
label1 "Did you hear me, Butterfly
label1 Miles to go before you sleep.
label1 What
label1 If they call you Butterfly, buy you a drink,  repeat that poem, you gotta give them a lap dance
label1 That's bullshit
label1 I ain't giving them nothing
label1 Well, you can do it or not, but if you don't,  everybody in Austin's gonna think you're a chickenshit
label1 And I don't think you want everybody in Austin thinking you're a chickenshit
label1 I ain't giving nobody no lap dance 'cause of what you said
label1 Yeah, everything's funny to you two when it's happening to me
label1 Look, you don't have to do it for anybody you don't want
label1 I said you'd do it for the first guy who says it
label1 So, some geek comes over, trying to be cool,  just tell him you already did it at another place earlier
label1 No harm, no foul, but you get a free drink out of it
label1 But maybe a little later in the evening,  you've had a few drinks, you're kind of looseygoosey,  you're safe with your girls,  then some kind of cute, kind of hot, kind of sexy, hysterically funny,  but not funnylooking guy comes up and says it,  then maybe you did it earlier, maybe you didn't
label1 You made me trip
label1 You made me trip, you dumb bitch

label1 Hold on
label1 Come over already
label1 We're waiting for you
label1 No, we're not coming over there
label1 You come over here like you said you would
label1 So, is it "Shawna" and the girls at the lake house this weekend
label1 "Shawna"
label1 I...  No
label1 Now, there is one thing that every girl in the whole world  whose name is Shanna has in common with each other,  we all hate the name Shawna,  and we really hate it when people call us Shawna
label1 Okay, but at some point in the evening, I had fuckability stock
label1 Yeah
label1 I mean...  it wasn't bullish, but..
label1 Okay, Warren's sending over shots
label1 And you know the house rule:  If he sends over shots, you've gotta do them
label1 Hey, them's the rules, baby
label1 Warren says it, we do it
label1 So let's do it
label1 What is it
label1 Hey, shot first, questions later
label1 Here we go
label1 Post time
label1 Mmm
label1 Ow
label1 What the fuck is it
label1 Chartreuse, the only liquor so good, they named a color after it
label1 Who's down for dos Chartreuse
label1 Not me
label1 I'm going out for a smoke
label1 Okay
label1 But careful where you keep that hot flame, all right
label1 Drinks
label1 What can I get you
label1 Shanna Banana
label1 Bombay Sapphire and tonic, no ice
label1 Good boy
label1 Oh
label1 Flip it
label1 Oh, Jesus Christ
label1 Whoa
label1 You scared the fuck out of me, you shitty asshole
label1 I just got lucky
label1 Oh, hardyfuckinghar
label1 Go inside
label1 Why
label1 I was thinking we could make out
label1 What, on a porch
label1 Not even in the bar, but in front of the entrance
label1 Forget it
label1 No, in my car
label1 What, out there
label1 Not in my car it's not
label1 Look, you won't get wet
label1 I promise you
label1 Hahaha
label1 You know what I mean
label1 Look, I know you guys are going to Lake LBJ, and we can't come
label1 Okay, just stop with the whining
label1 It's not attractive
label1 Okay, but I don't want it superfucking obvious  to everybody in the bar I've been gone,  so we'll go in your car, we'll make out for six minutes and that's it
label1 Deal
label1 Great
label1 Deal or no deal
label1 If you're gonna whine when I pull the plug in six minutes,  we can just walk back inside the fucking bar right now
label1 Deal
label1 No whining
label1 And no begging
label1 When you say done, it's done
label1 Okay, let's go
label1 Oh, you got two jobs:  kiss good and make sure my hair don't get wet

label1 But what's the point
label1 They're going to Shanna's daddy's house at Lake LBJ,  and it's no guys... absolutely no guys
label1 Okay, so after we bring the girls drinks,  in fairly rapid order, but not obvious, we order two more rounds of shots
label1 You think they're gonna fall for that
label1 Now it's time to turn up the volume
label1 No more fucking around
label1 We go to Jäger shots
label1 Man, they're not gonna drink Jäger shots
label1 Dude, as long as a guy's buying the booze, a fucking bitch'll drink anything
label1 After that, we'll see if they got another Jäger shot in them
label1 You never know
label1 That could be the shot that puts them past the point of "fuck it.
label1 My point exactly
label1 I know I can at least get Shanna "Suck My" Banana  to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot
label1 What's Julia's sweet shot
label1 Key lime pie
label1 Oh, come on

label1 Could I get a chicken suit for Stroker Ace, please
label1 I had to get something out of the car, and Nate was gentlemanly enough  to escort me with his umbrella
label1 Ah, good for you, Nate
label1 You see that pretty girl sitting by herself at the bar
label1 Who, the dirty hippie
label1 Meow
label1 She might as well be a hippie
label1 Thank you, Timmy boy
label1 Well, do you know what just happened to her
label1 No
label1 But I know she's a skinny, fakeblonde bitch
label1 Oh, I'm sorry
label1 What about her
label1 Hey, Warren, is there anybody in this place you could vouch for to give me a ride home
label1 Fair lady, your chariot awaits
label1 You've been eavesdropping
label1 I think I belong in the latter category
label1 So, uh, Icy Hot,  are you offering me a ride home
label1 And when are you thinking about leaving
label1 Truthfully, I'm not thinking about it
label1 But when I do, you will be the first to know
label1 I know looks can be deceiving,  but I'm a teetotaler
label1 I've been drinking club soda and lime all night,  and now I'm building up to my big drink
label1 Which is what
label1 Okay
label1 Why would someone who doesn't drink  spend hours at a bar drinking water
label1 A bar offers all kind of things other than alcohol
label1 Mmm
label1 Really
label1 Like what
label1 Women, nacho grande platters,  the fellowship of some fascinating individuals,  like Warren here
label1 Ooh
label1 Is that cowboy wisdom
label1 I'm not a cowboy, Pam
label1 But that's a very easy mistake to make
label1 How do you know my name
label1 When you were talking with Warren,  couldn't help but overhear
label1 So what's your name, Icy
label1 Stuntman Mike
label1 Stuntman Mike's your name
label1 You ask anybody
label1 Hey, Warren, who is this guy
label1 Stuntman Mike
label1 And who the hell is Stuntman Mike

label1 Hey, baby
label1 How are you
label1 Hey
label1 What's shaking, bacon
label1 Hey
label1 Well, beggars can't be choosers
label1 Take a picture
label1 It lasts longer
label1 What
label1 That table
label1 Seems to keep, um, getting your attention
label1 Is that the girl from the billboard outside
label1 She sure is a strikinglooking woman
label1 Lots of leavein conditioner
label1 Is that jealousy I detect
label1 Hardly
label1 But if you wanna get with, uh, Jungle Julia, there's a real easy way to do that
label1 Yeah
label1 What would that be
label1 Get famous
label1 You won't have to find her
label1 And you don't even wanna know what she did for that billboard
label1 Enjoy it, cocksucker
label1 You've earned it
label1 What did she ever do to you
label1 We went to school together from kindergarten through high school
label1 She was her height right now at 12
label1 She was a monster
label1 Half the guys she still fucks from the old class,  she used to beat up and terrorize in the fifth grade
label1 I see
label1 And she used to beat you up and take your chocolate milk, huh
label1 That pituitary case
label1 Sorry
label1 I'm built like a girl, not a black man
label1 But I'd die before I ever gave Julia Lucai my chocolate milk
label1 Hey, are you famous or something
label1 No, no, no
label1 Really
label1 Hey, what do you do
label1 What I do is work my ass off to get my own record label off the ground
label1 But why that girl wanted a picture of me  is because I'm a local deejay
label1 Wait a minute
label1 You got a billboard by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you
label1 I got one there, too, Zatoichi
label1 Yeah
label1 Jungle Julia Lucai
label1 Stuntman Mike McKay
label1 Now, my friends and I are gonna continue to get our weed on
label1 Would you care for some
label1 But just the same, no, thanks
label1 Suit yourself
label1 But, you know...  Aw, shit
label1 Oh, God
label1 Sorry
label1 It's nothing
label1 Actually, I do want you to have a shot
label1 You got some voucher here
label1 No fucking clue
label1 Well, technically, I really don't know if he's ever done anything for sure
label1 I mean, he shows me an episode of High Chaparall,  a guy falls off a horse, he says it's him
label1 Yeah, well, there was another actor on that show... Gary Clarke...  and I looked like him a bit
label1 Obviously, before I cut myself shaving
label1 Oh, I like it
label1 Well, damn if you ain't so sweet, you make sugar taste just like salt
label1 And, uh, then that show turned into The Men of Shiloh,  they brought on Lee Majors, and I doubled him
label1 From that point on, I specialized mostly in car stunts
label1 Yeah, I did damn near the whole third season of Vegas
label1 I was Robert Urich's driving double
label1 And then Bob did another show... Gavilan,  and he brought me with him on that till...  And after that...  Do you know any of these shows or people I'm talking about
label1 Sorry
label1 No
label1 So, how exactly does one become a stuntman,  Stuntman Mike
label1 Well, in Hollywood,  anybody fool enough to throw himself down a flight of stairs  can usually find somebody to pay him for it
label1 But, really, I got into the business  the way most people get in the stunt business
label1 My brother got me in it
label1 Well, who's your brother
label1 Stuntman Bob
label1 I'm trying to get these two shows happening in New York for November
label1 Finally
label1 Yeah
label1 You need to catch up with us
label1 Yep
label1 Anyhoo, I'm sorry
label1 Will you forgive me
label1 But you have to be real nice to me for the whole rest of the time I'm here
label1 You ready to go to the lake
label1 Mmhmm
label1 How about your little friend
label1 You wanna bring him
label1 I thought no boys
label1 If you really want him to come, Shanna won't mind
label1 So, how about it
label1 Good idea
label1 Ladies
label1 Thanks
label1 Cheers, Butterfly
label1 "The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  "and I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep
label1 "Did you hear me, Butterfly
label1 Miles to go before you sleep.
label1 Sorry, Stuntman Burt...  Mike
label1 She already broke off that dance
label1 Is that true
label1 Do I frighten you
label1 Is it my scar
label1 It's your car
label1 Ah
label1 Sorry
label1 It's my mom's car
label1 Have you been following us
label1 No
label1 It's just so damn small
label1 You've seen this guy before
label1 I saw him outside of Guero's
label1 And I saw you outside Guero's, too
label1 You saw my car, I saw your legs
label1 So you really weren't following us
label1 I'm not following you, Butterfly
label1 So, how about that lap dance
label1 Sorry
label1 It was a onetimeonly offer,  and she did it earlier this evening at Anton's
label1 No, she didn't
label1 How do you know
label1 I'm good that way
label1 What's "touchéd"
label1 Wounded slightly
label1 Why should I be wounded
label1 Because you expected guys to be pestering you all night,  but from your look, I can tell nobody pestered you at all
label1 There are few things as fetching as a bruised ego  on a beautiful angel
label1 I think I'm gonna have to give you a rain check
label1 Well, since you'll be leaving in the next couple of days,  that rain check will be worthless
label1 But that's okay
label1 I understand if I make you uncomfortable
label1 But I must warn you of something
label1 You know how people say...  "You're okay in my book,"  or, "In my book, that's no good"
label1 Well, I actually have a book
label1 And everybody I ever meet  goes in this book
label1 And now I've met you, and you're going in the book
label1 Except I'm afraid I must file you...  under "chickenshit.
label1 And what if I did it
label1 Well, I definitely couldn't file you under "chickenshit" then, now, could I
label1 Stuntman Mike
label1 Well, Stuntman Mike, I'm Butterfly
label1 Yeah, it is
label1 Yeah
label1 Why don't you go get ready for your lap dance

label1 Look, double fucks...  uhuh, I am not gonna fuck him
label1 He's old enough to be my dad..
label1 I can still hear you
label1 Bye
label1 Byebye
label1 Wow, that's fucking scary
label1 Scary tends to impress
label1 Is it safe
label1 Oh, it's better than safe
label1 It's death proof
label1 How do you make a car death proof
label1 Well, that's what stuntmen do
label1 Yeah
label1 Well, how do you think they accomplish that
label1 CGI
label1 But back in the allornothing days, the Vanishing Point days,  the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days,  the White Line Fever days...  real cars smashing into real cars  with real dumb people driving them
label1 So, you give the stunt team the car you want to smash up,  take her and reinforce that fucker everywhere,  and voilà, you got yourself a deathproof automobile
label1 That makes sense
label1 Hell, I can drive this baby into a brick wall  doing 125 miles an hour just for the experience
label1 Why is your passenger seat in a box
label1 Well, this is a movie car
label1 Sometimes when you're shooting a crash, director wants to put a camera in the car
label1 You know, shoot the crash from the inside
label1 They call it a crash box
label1 Here
label1 There you go
label1 You know, when you asked to drive me home,  you didn't mention your car didn't have a passenger seat
label1 You asked me for a ride, and I said yes
label1 But look at the bright side, Pam
label1 I won't be getting fresh putting my hand on your knee
label1 That is the bright side
label1 Well, Pam, which way you going
label1 Left or right
label1 Right
label1 Ah, that's too bad
label1 Why
label1 You see, we're both going left
label1 You could've just as easily been going left, too,  and if that was the case,  it would've been a while before you started getting scared
label1 But since you're going the other way,  I'm afraid...  you're gonna have to start getting scared... immediately
label1 Cocksucking motherfucker
label1 Just fucking let me out of here
label1 Okay, here's the thing
label1 I get it
label1 I..
label1 Um, but if you just stop right now,  you know, and... and... and let me out,  I'll never tell anybody, because I know it's a joke
label1 I know all about jokes
label1 I promise everything will be fine
label1 Just... Just... Just let me out,  please, and... and...  Hey, Pam,  remember when I said this car was death proof
label1 Well, that wasn't a lie
label1 This car is 100% death proof
label1 Only, to get the benefit of it, honey,  you really need to be sitting in my seat
label1 Now I gotta catch me my other girlfriends
label1 It's Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Tich
label1 So you got it
label1 Thanks, honey
label1 Good boy
label1 Byebye
label1 Who do you wanna hear
label1 Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Tich
label1 Who
label1 Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Tich
label1 Who the fuck are they

label1 I don't really see it's any of your business
label1 Come on now, sis
label1 You just tell us
label1 How bad is he
label1 He got banged up real good
label1 Busted nose, broken collarbone,  smashed up his left index finger
label1 He was real lucky
label1 That'll be all
label1 Why, that's more than enough, and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block
label1 Son of a bitch
label1 Well, son number one,  what I think is so goddamn ghoulish,  I hesitate to speak it out loud
label1 Well, give it a shot
label1 That old boy in there murdered them pretty little gals
label1 I mean, he used a car and not a hatchet, but they dead just the same
label1 Well, what are you gonna do
label1 Not a goddamn thing
label1 The DA says ain't no crime here
label1 And old Hooper in there  came out clean as a whistle
label1 Now, you actually think that he premeditatedly murdered them gals
label1 Well, I can't prove it,  but since thinking don't cost nothing, I can think it, and I do
label1 Yeah, but, Pop, he got pretty banged up hisself
label1 Well, hell, yeah, he got banged up, but God damn
label1 Any of 'em survive
label1 Two tons of metal, 200 miles an hour,  flesh and bone and plain old Newton..
label1 They all princess died
label1 Why
label1 Well, I'd guestimate it's a sex thing
label1 The only way I can figure it
label1 Highvelocity impact,  twisted metal, busted glass,  all four souls taken exactly at the same time
label1 Probably the only way that diabolical degenerate can shoot his goo
label1 Yeah, I think the only thing we can dream of getting that bastard on  is vehicular manslaughter for the hitchhiker in the death box
label1 Now, on paper, it's gonna look like he's just trying to help her out
label1 I mean, that's the way the jury's gonna see it
label1 So what are you gonna do, Pop
label1 Well, I can take it upon myself to work the case, you know,  in my off hours
label1 Alert authorities
label1 Dog that rotten son of a bitch
label1 Wherever he goes, I go
label1 Or I can spend  the same goddamn amount of time and energy  following the NASCAR circuit
label1 Hmm
label1 I think I'd have a hell of lot happier life if I did the latter
label1 And just because I can't punish old... Frankenstein in there for what he's done,  I'm gonna tell you like the Lord told John

label1 Who's in whose room
label1 He's in mine
label1 And, so, what happened then
label1 That was pretty much it
label1 We made out in the hall for about 10 minutes, and then I sent him off to his room
label1 So, how's The Rock as a kisser
label1 He's got them mushy lips and fingertips
label1 Mmm, I love them mushy lips
label1 And he's a big guy,  so he spins me around so my back's up against him
label1 Damn, that sounds sexy
label1 Mmm, it was sexy
label1 But then that was it
label1 You sent him off
label1 Wait a minute
label1 What are we doing here
label1 If I'm gonna power through and pick up Zoë at the airport,  I need a bigass cup of coffee
label1 Since you're getting that,  can you get some more vodka and some more sugarfree Red Bull
label1 We didn't know you were awake
label1 But get some more vodka and some more sugarfree Red Bull anyway
label1 And some Red Apple Tans
label1 Damn
label1 I didn't stop to get you bitches groceries
label1 You remember how to get to the airport, don't you
label1 Uhhuh
label1 Well, then, you should get behind the wheel,  'cause you gonna drive
label1 They ain't got sugarfree Red Bull

label1 I've seen Kim sit on it before
label1 Her ass ain't your ass
label1 So, I think I'm in this month's issue of Allure
label1 You got Allure
label1 Magazines by the window
label1 Here you are
label1 You hot mama, you
label1 3.85
label1 Out of 20
label1 Thank you very much
label1 You know, I got other fashion magazines for sale behind the counter
label1 No, that's okay
label1 This'll be all
label1 Thanks anyway
label1 Have a good one
label1 I got this month's issue of Italian Vogue
label1 Listen to this
label1 The Circle A clerk has this month's issue of Italian Vogue
label1 No way
label1 Way
label1 I can't believe a fucking Circle A carries Italian Vogue
label1 It doesn't
label1 It's his own personal copy
label1 Twentyseven bucks
label1 We're talking about fucking per diem here
label1 Look, we found an issue of Italian Vogue in Lebanon, Tennessee
label1 We're lucky he's not asking for fucking Krugerrands
label1 I'm getting it, and we're splitting it three ways
label1 What, me, you and Kim
label1 No, Kim doesn't give a shit about Italian Vogue
label1 But Brandy will come in with us, and if she won't, Tysla, her sister, will
label1 But if anybody tears out any sheets I want,  you gotta make color Xerox of those pages
label1 And I'm not talking fucking Kinko's here either, okay
label1 You take it to the art department, you have them do it fucking right

label1 Your timing couldn't be better, Zoë
label1 It just so happens that we're all three off duty for the next three days of shooting
label1 Well, I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup, and she's off for the next three days,  there's no stunts being filmed during that time, so Kim's free,  and Lee's on a "will notify" for the next four days
label1 So, how's the shoot going
label1 Great
label1 We're having the best time
label1 We're making the coolest movie and partying all the time
label1 Hell, yeah
label1 The next job after this one is definitely gonna suck
label1 So, let's hear it, ladies
label1 Set romances
label1 Who's getting it off
label1 That would be Lee and Toolbox
label1 Oh, Toolbox
label1 He's a grip
label1 What he is is a pervert
label1 Well, he just keeps sounding better and better
label1 What's his perversion
label1 Lee is sitting on the toilet, and Toolbox is watching her pee
label1 PISSING
label1 Yeah, but not no more
label1 Now she's getting it on with The Rock
label1 Not the real Rock
label1 He's this electrician named Bruce
label1 And Kim started calling him The Rock, 'cause he kind of looks like The Rock,  so now we all just call him The Rock
label1 This is an allstar crew
label1 We got a guy who looks like Nick Cage  and a guy who looks like Peewee Herman, too
label1 Kim, dick department
label1 Let's hear it
label1 Mmmm
label1 I got a man
label1 About three months
label1 Who'd you steal him from
label1 Nobody
label1 Wha... What
label1 He totally had a girlfriend
label1 All of Kim's boyfriends start out as somebody else's boyfriend
label1 I did not steal him
label1 I didn't steal any of them
label1 They just... jumped ship
label1 So, what's your story, Abernathy
label1 I had a set crush on Cecil
label1 Set crush
label1 You were his set wife
label1 "Were" and "had" being the key words here
label1 Bitch, you two are still into each other, and you know it
label1 Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me,  then whey did he fuck Daryl Hannah's standin
label1 Hohoho
label1 Oh, it's so funny
label1 Oh, it's so funny
label1 Oh, stop acting all hurt
label1 Your ass just mad
label1 Bitch, you need to get over that shit
label1 That was two weeks ago
label1 Oh, well, now that you put it like that
label1 Oh, I haven't told you the best part
label1 He fucked her on my birthday
label1 Oh, that's a horse of a different color
label1 He's the director
label1 He's kind of busy
label1 He ate a piece of my birthday cake and he got me a present
label1 Yeah, I think he knew
label1 Well, what did he get you
label1 He made me a tape
label1 Yeah
label1 Wait
label1 He didn't burn you a CD
label1 He made you a tape
label1 Yeah
label1 Oh, that is so romantic
label1 I know what you're gonna say, so don't even go there
label1 Look, I know you guys like him
label1 He's likable, but he fucked another woman on my birthday
label1 How can you not be on my side
label1 Well, I admit, that sounds bad
label1 It is bad
label1 Were you two fucking
label1 Hell, no
label1 Hello
label1 Is your name Abernathy
label1 Sorry
label1 The answer to your question is no, of course not
label1 And if you fuck Cecil, you don't become one of his girlfriends
label1 Not to say I want to be his girlfriend,  but if I did want to be his girlfriend,  if I fucked him, I wouldn't be his girlfriend
label1 I'd be one of his regulars
label1 And I'm just getting too fucking old for that shit
label1 Yes
label1 I've let him give me a foot massage,  and when we go to the movies, I've let him hold my hand
label1 Bitch, you might be acting like you 12 years old,  but he just acting like a man
label1 You need to break that nigga off a piece
label1 Let me get this straight
label1 You're not sucking him...  Mmmm
label1 You're not giving him any tongue, but Daryl Hannah's standin is
label1 Okay, can we just take my sex life off the table
label1 Ohhh
label1 Fuck both of you and your little high five
label1 Before you can claim a nigga, you got to claim a nigga,  and you can start by giving that motherfucker a hand job  in the back of the van on Tuesday
label1 I'm not gonna do that
label1 I know you won't
label1 But you know who will
label1 The bitch that ends up living in that bigass mansion of his
label1 Now, I gotta say, I haven't entirely agreed with everything Kim said, but it is true:  If you stretch shit out like you have with Cecil,  and you suddenly get dirty on them,  it blows their mind
label1 Three Kicks to the Head, Part Three
label1 And, admittedly, we're a little fuckedup
label1 Cheers to that
label1 Word
label1 Cheers
label1 So, Zoë,  the genius,  wants to take a picture of me
label1 So she's got her camera and keeps saying,  "Step back a little," so I do
label1 Then, "A little further," so I step back a little further
label1 Then, "A little more," so I do
label1 Then I realize I'm right at the edge  of a sevenfoot concrete ditch  with God knows how many rocks and broken bottles and rats in it,  and if I fell in that fucking thing, I'd probably would've broken my fucking neck
label1 So I'm yelling at her, "Zoë, you almost killed me!
label1 So we laugh about it and walk a little further,  and Zoë starts fucking around,  and damn if she doesn't fall in the fucking ditch
label1 Nice
label1 Thank you
label1 Thank you
label1 I remember taking a step and looking down
label1 What happened
label1 What, with Zoë the cat
label1 Nothing
label1 If I fell in that fucking thing,  they would've had to helicopter me out of there
label1 Zoë just lands on her feet
label1 But then, later, I started feeling a little bad about myself
label1 Zoë falls in the ditch, and it's nothing
label1 We're laughing about it
label1 Oh, honey, you can't think like that
label1 You know, we all have our individual talents,  and that just happens to be one of Zoë's
label1 Well...  physically speaking, Zoë is amazing
label1 I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness
label1 There's few human beings that can fuck with Zoë on that front
label1 Oh, Kim, I like you, too
label1 You didn't fall in the ditch, Zoë did
label1 Zoë even knew there was a ditch there because you told her,  and she still fell in
label1 So, Lee's right
label1 We all have our talents
label1 Hey, I resemble that remark
label1 Check it out, bitch
label1 Ooh, nice one, mate
label1 What's a roscoe
label1 A roscoe is a pistol
label1 You carry a gun
label1 Uhhuh
label1 You have a license to carry it
label1 When I became a Secret Service agent, they gave me a license
label1 Oh, I didn't know you were..
label1 Okay, I didn't say it, all right
label1 Stop looking at me
label1 God
label1 Did you know Kim carried a gun
label1 Yes
label1 Now, do I approve
label1 No
label1 Yes
label1 Look, I don't know what futuristic utopia you live in,  but the world I live in, a bitch need a gun
label1 You can't get around the fact that people who carry guns  tend to get shot more than people who don't
label1 And you can't get around the fact that if I go down  to the laundry room in my building at midnight enough times,  I might get my ass raped
label1 Fuck that
label1 There are other things you can carry other than a gun
label1 Pepper spray
label1 Uh, motherfucker try to rape me, I don't wanna give him a skin rash
label1 I wanna shut that nigga down
label1 How about a knife at least
label1 You know what happens to motherfuckers carry knives
label1 They get shot
label1 Look, if I ever become a famous actress,  I won't carry a gun
label1 I'll hire me a dodirt nigga, and he'll carry the gun
label1 And when shit goes down, I'll sit back and laugh
label1 So, Zoë, you thought about what you want to do first
label1 It just so happens I know exactly what I wanna do
label1 Oh, really
label1 And what would that be
label1 To me, there's no point in being in America  unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car
label1 And I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger
label1 Um, well, I guess we can talk to Transpo
label1 But does it have to be a Dodge Challenger
label1 It has to be a 1970 Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine
label1 How in the fuck do you expect to do that
label1 No worries, mate
label1 I've got it all worked out
label1 When I knew I was coming here, I went online and found out  that the local paper here in Tennessee is the Lebanon News Sentinel
label1 I'm sorry
label1 Where's home
label1 Australia, right
label1 What do you mean by that, mate
label1 I repeat, never... call a Kiwi an Aussie
label1 That is, unless you want your ass kicked
label1 I'm so sorry
label1 Oh, it's okay
label1 We're just taking the piss out of you, mate
label1 Auckland, to answer your question
label1 Anyway, I subscribed to the local paper a month ago
label1 Now, why the fuck you want a local redneck newspaper in New Zealand
label1 I've been getting the paper for the last month,  and I've been checking the classified at the back, looking at cars for sale
label1 And you wanna buy it
label1 Kim, I may be stupid, but I'm not bloody stupid
label1 I wanna say I wanna buy it, so he'll let me testdrive it
label1 A 1970 Dodge Challenger with a white paint job
label1 Kowalski from Vanishing Point
label1 Mate, it's a fucking classic
label1 Mmm, I get it
label1 If I can get this guy to let me drive it without him,  I will blow the doors off that bitch
label1 What's Vanishing Point
label1 "What's Vanishing Point?
label1 Abs, I'm supposed to be the illiterate one
label1 It's just one of the best American movies ever made
label1 Actually, Zoë, most girls wouldn't know Vanishing Point
label1 Excuse me
label1 What the fuck are you two
label1 Yeah, well, we're gearheads
label1 Of course we watched it
label1 Y'all grew up watching that Pretty in Pink shit
label1 Oh, I like Pretty in Pink
label1 What, so you didn't watch John Hughes movies
label1 I'm a girl
label1 But I also watched car shit, too
label1 Vanishing Point, Dirty Mary Crazy Larry...  Mmhmm
label1 Gone in 60 Seconds..
label1 We have an outdoors theater in Auckland
label1 It plays Vanishing Point, Big Wednesday,  all the classics
label1 What do you horny gals want
label1 Hey, you got a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale
label1 Right up here, ladies
label1 This shit is off the fucking hook
label1 Sweet ass
label1 Well, if you'll excuse me for a moment,  I'd just like to have a word alone with my business associate
label1 Okay
label1 Mmm
label1 What are you waiting for
label1 Ask him to let you drive it by yourself
label1 I..
label1 I intend to, but first, I need to ask you something
label1 What
label1 If he lets us take it out on our own, I wanna play ship's mast
label1 Would you keep it down
label1 Ain't no way I'm doing ship's mast
label1 For Christ sakes...   Don't blaspheme
label1 Sorry
label1 Look, I know what I said...  What did you say
label1 I know I said we shouldn't do this again...  No
label1 You didn't say we shouldn't
label1 You said we ain't ever gonna do that again
label1 Now, did you or did you not say that
label1 Well...  No, no, no, no
label1 Answer the question, motherfucker
label1 Did you or did you not say that
label1 Yes, I said that
label1 However...  Whatever with your "however.
label1 Look, I know I said it, and I know I meant it..
label1 Yeah, but when I said it, I didn't mean in America
label1 Oh, nigga, please
label1 Really..
label1 I meant we should never play ship's mast again  in New Zealand or Australia
label1 Look, I know what I said when I said it
label1 But when I said it, I didn't know I'd ever come to America
label1 Right
label1 Okay, oddly enough, I actually understood that
label1 However, just because you talked yourself into some stupid shit  doesn't mean I have lost my goddamn mind
label1 You need two people to play ship's mast, and I ain't playing
label1 I don't need me no best friend lives on the other side of planet Earth
label1 I'll crack your back
label1 You'll crack it anyway
label1 Well, of course I'll crack it anyway
label1 But now, while I'm here, I'll be your backcracking slave
label1 Whenever you want it, you got it
label1 You don't even have to ask for it
label1 Just be, like...  "Bitch, get over here and get busy.
label1 You crack my back, you'll give me foot massages...  Mmhmm
label1 Mmm
label1 Deal
label1 So, we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him
label1 If he does, you wait here with Lee, and we'll be back in a moment
label1 I said, we're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him..
label1 I heard what you said
label1 I just can't believe what you said
label1 You know, you two got some fucking balls
label1 What
label1 Don't play dumbass with me
label1 I'm still a little drunk and I have a hangover
label1 But because Zoë wanted to drive some fucking Vanishing Point car, I'm here
label1 Now you two got the balls to ask me... no, scratch that...  tell me I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad  while the cool kids get to go out and play
label1 Bullshit on that
label1 It ain't like that
label1 Then what's it like, Kim
label1 You guys are our collateral
label1 I really think one human being will be collateral enough
label1 You're not gonna wanna do what we're doing
label1 What, drive a car
label1 Mmm
label1 What, drive it fast
label1 We're doing more than that
label1 But that's okay
label1 We're stunt people
label1 We ain't got good sense
label1 How do you know I don't wanna do it
label1 'Cause you're a mom
label1 Yeah
label1 You know, we're supposed to be this big posse,  but that's the excuse you guys use  whenever you want to exclude me from something
label1 So, what is it you two daredevils are doing that I'm just so uncool,  I couldn't possibly understand
label1 You know, we're kind of conning this guy,  so maybe it's best that we don't go into detail about it while he's watching us
label1 Besides, he's probably not gonna let us do it anyway
label1 How about this
label1 I'll talk him into it
label1 But if I talk him into it, I go along
label1 Eh, that's my problem
label1 But don't worry
label1 He'll say yes
label1 No
label1 I'm gonna insinuate that Lee's gonna blow him
label1 That's good
label1 But let me handle it
label1 We got a deal
label1 Okay, Mommy, listen up
label1 You wanna hang with the cool kids,  you got to be cool
label1 We take you along, you don't say shit
label1 You don't even say crap
label1 Got it
label1 I'm serious now
label1 You start nagging us, we're pulling over to the side of the road,  kicking your ass out and picking you up later
label1 Okay
label1 Go work your magic
label1 Hello, sir
label1 Hello
label1 Hello
label1 What's your name
label1 Hello, Jasper
label1 Aber... what
label1 Abernathy
label1 What's your first name
label1 That is my first name
label1 What kind of first name is that
label1 You know what
label1 Just call me Abbie
label1 Jasper, we were wondering if my friends and I  could take the car out for a little testdrive out on our own
label1 You know, just to see if we're comfortable in it
label1 Why would I do something stupid like that
label1 To better sell your automobile
label1 Four reasons, actually
label1 One, we're not thieves
label1 Three, we're staying at the Days Inn in town
label1 You can call the hotel, check with management
label1 We're registered for the next month
label1 Actually, Zoë's not
label1 Who's Kim
label1 The colored girl
label1 Yes
label1 Kim would be the girl of color
label1 And reason number four, and the most important,  while we're taking the car out for a little spin,  that'll give you a better opportunity to get acquainted  with our other friend, Lee
label1 That would be because she's a famous actress
label1 Oh
label1 Why is she dressed like that
label1 What's a cheerleader movie
label1 A movie about cheerleaders
label1 Is it a porno movie
label1 Yes, it is
label1 But don't mention it
label1 She's shy
label1 Lee, this is Jasper
label1 Now, you two kids stay out of trouble
label1 Hey, goodlookin', be back to pick you up later
label1 Tata
label1 You thinking what I'm thinking
label1 I think I'm thinking it
label1 What are you and you thinking
label1 Where y'all going
label1 You stay put
label1 I gotta take a..
label1 So, you ready to do this
label1 Well, I always don't wanna do it right before I'm gonna do it
label1 You know what I mean
label1 Yeah, I know what you mean, 'cause I don't wanna do it
label1 Kim..
label1 I'm just saying
label1 Look, if you're gonna take the piss out of it..
label1 You wanna start out on top
label1 Practically doesn't count if you start on the top
label1 Here are your gloves
label1 I'm wearing the jacket
label1 This is my jacket
label1 Come on
label1 I'm the one who's on the fucking bonnet
label1 "Bonnet," my ass
label1 You on the hood
label1 Give me your belt
label1 Oh
label1 But this is my cute shit
label1 Get Abernathy's belt
label1 Fine
label1 We'll use Abbie's belt
label1 Give me your belt
label1 No
label1 Prada
label1 Come on, give her the belt
label1 Magic word
label1 Just 'cause you asked nicely
label1 It's nice to be nice, Kim
label1 You know what
label1 Don't even fucking think about asking me next time you want me to do your hair
label1 Your ass gonna do it
label1 Yeah, and you'll ask "pretty please," bitch,  because that's what you do when no one else is looking
label1 I ain't getting that shit
label1 Abernathy, don't get on my nerves right now
label1 I got shit on my mind
label1 Ooh
label1 It's cold
label1 Can we roll up one of these windows
label1 No
label1 Okay, Abernathy
label1 What the fuck are you guys doing
label1 What does that mean
label1 Whoa
label1 Faster, you black bitch
label1 Faster
label1 Is that fast enough for your bony ass
label1 Whoahohoho
label1 Abernathy, get your ass up here
label1 Whoa, whoa, whoa
label1 Go, go, go
label1 Check it out, bitch
label1 You want it fucking faster
label1 Oh, my God
label1 Shit

label1 Did you do something to him
label1 Nothing
label1 Shit
label1 Shit, here he comes
label1 Here he comes
label1 Oh, Shit
label1 Shit
label1 Oh, shit
label1 Whoa
label1 Oh, my God
label1 Zoë
label1 Oh

label1 Zoë
label1 I'm sorry I called you a black bitch
label1 Now hold the fuck on
label1 Whoa
label1 Whoa
label1 Get away
label1 Oh, shit
label1 I can't fucking see
label1 I can't see
label1 Zoë, move your legs
label1 Come on

label1 Redneck lunatic bastard
label1 Baby, just hold on
label1 Zoë...  Fuck you
label1 Oh, my God
label1 Come on
label1 Come on

label1 God damn it
label1 Zoë
label1 He's coming up

label1 Asshole
label1 ♪ Hang up the chick habit ♪  ♪ Hang it up, Daddy, or you'll be alone in a quick ♪   Come on, Abbie
label1 I got this
label1 [horses snorting]   Whoa
label1 Who's that stumblin' around in the dark
label1 State your business or prepare to get winged
label1 Calm yourselves, gentlemen
label1 I mean you no harm
label1 Whoa, boy
label1 Good cold evening, gentlemen
label1 I'm looking for a pair of slave traders  that go by the name of the Speck Brothers
label1 Might that be you
label1 Who wants to know
label1 I'm Dr. King Schultz
label1 This is my horse, Fritz
label1 What kinda doctor
label1 [Schultz] Dentist
label1 And did you purchase those men at the Greenville slave auction
label1 So what
label1 So I wish to parley with you
label1 Speak English
label1 Please forgive me
label1 It is a second language
label1 Now, amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe,  is a specimen I'm keen to acquire
label1 Is there one amongst you who was formerly a resident  of the Carrucan plantation
label1 Who said that
label1 What's your name
label1 Django
label1 Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are
label1 Who are they
label1 Big John
label1 Roger
label1 Sometime they call him Lil Raj
label1 They was overseers at the Carrucan plantation
label1 Not anymore
label1 Tell me...  ...if you were to see any of these three gentlemen again,   would you recognize them
label1 [man] Hey
label1 Stop talkin' to him like that
label1 Like What
label1 My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain..
label1 Speak English, goddamn it
label1 Everybody calm down
label1 I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction
label1 No sale
label1 Now, off with ya
label1 Move it
label1 My good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture  or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention
label1 Last chance, fancy pants
label1 Oh, very well
label1 I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,  but I didn't want you to do anything rash  before you had a moment to come to your senses
label1 You goddamn son of a bitch
label1 Well...  And you killed Ace
label1 I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me
label1 And I do believe I have... one, two, three, four...  ...five witnesses who can attest to that fact
label1 No doubt
label1 Now, if you could keep your caterwauling down to a minimum,  I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django
label1 [man] Godfuckin'damn it
label1 As I was saying...  ...if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again, you could recognize 'em
label1 Yeah
label1 So, Mr. Speck
label1 Mr. Speck
label1 How much for young Django here
label1 Oh, could you hold this for a moment
label1 Django
label1 Get up on that horse
label1 Also, if I were you,  I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind
label1 Nigger
label1 Don't you touch my brother's coat
label1 Oh
label1 One hundred... ten... 20...  ...and five...  ...for young Django here
label1 And since he won't be needing it anymore,  I'd like to purchase your brother's nag
label1 Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale
label1 Do you have one
label1 [scoffs]  I thought not
label1 No worries
label1 I come prepared
label1 Thank you
label1 Whoa
label1 Now, as to you poor devils
label1 So, as I see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next,  you gentlemen have two choices
label1 One: Once I'm gone, you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck,  then carry him to the nearest town
label1 Which would be at least 37 miles back the way you came
label1 Or two: You could unshackle yourselves, take that rifle,  put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep,  and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country
label1 Oh, and on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you,  the North Star is that one
label1 Tata
label1 [clucking]  Now wait a minute, fellas
label1 Let's talk about this
label1 I'm not a bad guy
label1 I'm just doin' my job
label1 Tell you what, boys: Take me to the doc in El Paso,   I'll get you your freedom
label1 [gun cocking]   No
label1 No, please...  [gunshot echoing]    All right, now
label1 I'd like you to take two of these tonight...   [coughing]  ...and then in the morning...  That's a nigger on a horse
label1 What's everybody staring at
label1 Whoa
label1 Good morning, innkeeper
label1 Two beers for two weary travelers
label1 We won't be open for another hour
label1 By then, we'll be servin' breakfast
label1 the hell you think you're doing, boy
label1 Get that nigger outta here
label1 [panting] Help
label1 Help
label1 Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshal
label1 Alas
label1 Now we must act as our own bartender
label1 What kind of dentist are you
label1 [chortles]  Despite that cart, I haven't practiced dentistry in five years
label1 Do you know what a bounty hunter is
label1 No
label1 Well...  ...the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash,  a bounty hunter deals in corpses
label1 Prost
label1 The state places a bounty on a man's head
label1 I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man
label1 Sometimes that's easier said than done
label1 I show that corpse to the authorities, proving yes, indeed,  I truly have killed him,  at which point the authorities pay me the bounty
label1 So, like slavery, it's a flesh for cash business
label1 What's a bounty
label1 It's like a reward
label1 And they give you a reward
label1 Certain people, yeah
label1 Bad people
label1 Badder they are, bigger the reward
label1 Which brings me to you
label1 And I must admit, I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you
label1 On one hand, I despise slavery
label1 On the other hand, I need your help
label1 So, for the time being, I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey  work to my benefit
label1 Still, having said that, I feel guilty
label1 I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers
label1 However, at this endeavor,  I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar as I don't know what they look like
label1 But you do
label1 Don't ya
label1 Good
label1 So here's my agreement
label1 Where we goin'
label1 I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,  but I don't know where
label1 That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find 'em
label1 And when we find them, you point them out, and I kill them
label1 You do that, I agree to give you your freedom,  $25 per Brittle Brother
label1 That's $75
label1 And, as if on cue, here comes the sheriff
label1 Fun's over
label1 Come on out
label1 [overlapping chatter]  All right, folks, calm down
label1 Go about your business
label1 These jokers will be gone soon
label1 And scare all these nice people
label1 You ain't got nothing better to do  than to come into Bill Sharp's town  and show your ass
label1 [metal springing noise]  [sheriff screaming]   [crowd gasping]  [groaning]    What'd you just do to our sheriff
label1 Should we wait inside
label1 Can we just leave
label1 After you
label1 Move that buckboard a long ways across the street from the saloon
label1 I want two men, two rifles up on this roof
label1 Two men, two rifles on that roof
label1 All the barrels aimed at that front door
label1 Somebody get poor Bill outta the goddamn street
label1 You in the saloon
label1 You got one chance to get out of this alive
label1 I have the pleasure of addressing
label1 Yes, it is
label1 This is U.S
label1 Marshal Gill Tatum
label1 Na wunderbar, marshal
label1 I have relieved myself of all weapons,  and just as you have instructed,  I am ready to step outside  with my hands raised above my head
label1 I trust as a representative  of the criminal justice system of the United States of America,  I shan't be shot down in the street by either you or your deputies  before I've had my day in court
label1 Shot him down like a dog in the street
label1 Yes, that's exactly what I mean
label1 Do I have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street
label1 Fair enough, marshal
label1 Here we come
label1 They're a little tense out there
label1 So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking
label1 You unarmed
label1 Marshal Tatum, may I address you and your deputies,  and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey,  as to the incident that just occurred
label1 Go on
label1 My name is Dr. King Schultz
label1 Like yourself, marshal, I'm a servant of the court
label1 The man lying dead in the dirt, who the good people of Daughtrey  saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of Bill Sharp,  is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,  with a price on his head of $200
label1 Now that's $200, dead or alive
label1 I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news
label1 But I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff  sometime in the past two years
label1 Yeah
label1 years ago, he was rustling cattle  from the B.C
label1 Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas
label1 Now, this is a warrant made out by  Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas
label1 He'll back up who I am and who your dear departed sheriff was
label1 I'll be damned
label1 After this Brittle business is behind us,  you'll be a free man, with a horse, $75 in your back pocket...  What's your plan after that
label1 Find my wife, and buy her freedom
label1 Do most slaves believe in marriage
label1 Oh, me and my wife do
label1 Old Man Carrucan didn't
label1 That's why we, uh... we run off
label1 Django, Django  You got sand, Django
label1 Boy's got sand
label1 I got no use for a nigger with sand
label1 I want you to burn a runaway "r" right here on his cheek
label1 And I want you to take 'em to the Greenville auction and sell 'em
label1 Both of 'em
label1 And this one...  ...you will sell him cheap
label1 In Greenville...  ...there should be some sort of a records office
label1 What is her name
label1 Broomhilda
label1 What
label1 Broomhilda
label1 Broomhilda
label1 Hmmm
label1 Were her owners German
label1 Yeah, how you know
label1 She was raised by a German mistress, the Von Shafts
label1 She speak a little German, too
label1 Your wife
label1 When she was little, her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody  to speak German with
label1 Well, let me get this straight
label1 Your slave wife speaks German and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft
label1 Yep
label1 They call me Hildi
label1 You'll be playing a character
label1 No
label1 During the act, you can never break character
label1 Do you understand
label1 Yeah
label1 Don't break character
label1 What that is
label1 That's a fancy word for servant
label1 Valet
label1 Hmmm
label1 And now, Django, you may choose your character's costume
label1 But of course
label1 resumes playing]  Whoa
label1 It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory
label1 This is my valet
label1 I said niggers on horses...  [Schultz] His name is Django
label1 He's a free man
label1 He can ride what he pleases
label1 Not around my niggers, he can't
label1 My good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot
label1 Allow me to unring this bell
label1 This is my valet, Django
label1 And these are our horses, Tony and Fritz
label1 [snorting]  [women giggling]  Mr. Bennett
label1 I've been led to believe that you are a gentleman and a businessman
label1 I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals
label1 You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee  to buy one of my nigger gals
label1 No appointment, no nothin'
label1 Well, what if I was to say I don't like you
label1 Or your fancypants nigger
label1 And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn
label1 Now what you got to say about that
label1 Mr. Bennett
label1 If you are the businessman I've been led to believe you to be,  I have 5,000 things I might say that could change your mind
label1 Well, come on inside and get yourself somethin' cool to drink
label1 Hmmm
label1 Oh, well, absolutely
label1 Uh, Betina
label1 Yessir, Big Daddy
label1 Uh...  What's your Jimmie's name again
label1 <i>'</i> Django
label1 Betina, sugar, could you take Django there  and take him around the grounds here and show him all the pretty stuff
label1 As you please, Big Daddy
label1 Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you, Django is a free man
label1 He... within the bounds of good taste,  he must be treated as an extension of myself
label1 Understood, Schultz
label1 Yes'm
label1 Django isn't a slave
label1 Django is a free man, you understand
label1 You can't treat him like any of the other niggers around here,  'cause he ain't like any of the other niggers around here
label1 You want I should treat him like white folks
label1 No
label1 That's not what I said
label1 Then I don't know what you want, Big Daddy
label1 Yes, I can see that
label1 Uh...  What's the name of that peckerwood boy from town that works with the glass
label1 Oh, you mean Jerry
label1 That's the boy's name
label1 Jerry
label1 You know Jerry, don't you, sugar
label1 Well, that's it, then
label1 That house we just left from is The Big House
label1 Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big
label1 That there is the pantry
label1 That's where Big Daddy hang all his dead meat
label1 What you do for your massa
label1 Didn't you hear him tell you I ain't no slave
label1 So you really free
label1 Yes, I's free
label1 You mean you wanna dress like that
label1 Betina, I need to ask you somethin'
label1 What you want
label1 Three brothers
label1 Overseers
label1 Their name is Brittle
label1 Brittle
label1 Yes, Brittle
label1 John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj
label1 They could be usin' a different name
label1 They woulda come to the plantation this past year
label1 Maybe
label1 Three brothers
label1 Uhhuh
label1 They here
label1 Uhhuh
label1 Could you point one of 'em out to me
label1 gonna appreciate this, now
label1 She work in the house, John
label1 You could mess her skin up, and you gonna mess her up  and she ain't gonna be worth... she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing
label1 Now, your Bible say...  that I was one that made her do it
label1 You ready
label1 She didn't wanna run off with me
label1 It should be me, John
label1 Now, I been here long enough, you know me, you know me a long time, now
label1 You know Massa Carrucan ain't gonna appreciate this
label1 She a house slave, she can't be...  [screaming]    On my knees
label1 I'm asking you this, please
label1 Ain't this what you want
label1 Now, John, please
label1 L's on my knees, John
label1 I like the way you beg, boy
label1 Is that who you was lookin' for
label1 Yep
label1 They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs
label1 Point me in that direction
label1 You go to that tree and keep goin' thata way
label1 Go get that white man I came here with
label1 [man] Come on, now
label1 No, no, please
label1 [shrieks] Please
label1 Come on
label1 Get you set up now
label1 [screaming]  "And the Lord said, 'The fear of ye..."   [cracking]  "...and the dread of ye  shall be on every beast of the earth."
label1 Come here now, woman
label1 [screaming]  OK, she's ready
label1 And after this, we'll see if you break eggs again
label1 John Brittle
label1 You remember me
label1 [metal springing noise]  I like the way you die, boy
label1 Goddamn son of a bitch
label1 [grunting]    Y'all wanna see somethin'
label1 No
label1 That's Big John, and that's Lil Raj
label1 Where's Ellis
label1 He's the one hightailin' it across that field right now
label1 You sure that's him
label1 Yeah
label1 Positive
label1 You don't know if you're positive
label1 I don't know what "positive" mean
label1 It means you're sure
label1 "Yes," what
label1 Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle
label1 Django
label1 Everybody calm down
label1 We mean no one else any harm
label1 Who are you two jokers
label1 I am Dr. King Schultz, a legal representative  of the criminal justice system of the United States of America
label1 The man to my left is Django Freeman
label1 In my pocket is a warrant,  signed by Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,  for the arrest and capture, dead or alive,  of John Brittle, Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle
label1 They were goin' by the name Shaffer
label1 You know them by the name of Shaffer, but the butchers' real name was Brittle
label1 These are wanted men
label1 The law wants 'em for murder
label1 I realize passions are high,  but I must warn you, the penalty for taking deadly force  against an officer of the court in the performance of his duty  is you'll be hung by the neck until you're dead
label1 Now, may I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it
label1 Satisfied
label1 May I have that back, please
label1 Get off my land
label1 Load up the bodies as quickly as you can and let's get outta here
label1 Yeah, that's them sonsabitches
label1 [dramatic choral music]  [horses snorting, whinnying]   Come on, men
label1 [man 1] We're coming for you, nigger
label1 [man 2] Heehaw
label1 That's way too simple for these jokers
label1 We're gonna whup that niggerlover to death
label1 And I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself
label1 Damn
label1 We ready or what
label1 I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes
label1 [fabric ripping]  Oh... Oh, shit
label1 Who made this goddamn shit
label1 Willard's wife
label1 Well, make your own goddamn masks
label1 Look, nobody's sayin' they don't appreciate what Jenny did
label1 Well, if all I had to do was cut a hole in a bag,  I coulda cut it better than this
label1 What about you, Robert
label1 Not too good
label1 I mean, if I don't move my head I can see you pretty good, more or less
label1 But when I start ridin', the bag's movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind
label1 Shit
label1 I just made mine worse
label1 Oh, God
label1 No, nobody brought an extra bag
label1 I'm just askin'
label1 Do we have to wear 'em when we ride
label1 Oh, well, shitfire
label1 If you don't wear 'em as you ride up, that just defeats the purpose
label1 Well, I can't see in this fuckin' thing
label1 Well, fuck all y'all
label1 I'm goin' home
label1 Now, I watched my wife work all day gettin' 30 bags together  for you ungrateful sonsabitches,  and all I can hear is criticize, criticize, criticize
label1 From now on, don't ask me or mine for nothin'
label1 We got a killer nigger over that hill there
label1 And we gotta make a lesson out of him
label1 Are the bags on or off
label1 I think we all think the bag was a nice idea
label1 Yeah
label1 [mumbling agreements]  But, not pointin' any fingers, they coulda been done better
label1 So how 'bout no bags this time,  but next time we do the bags right and then we go full regalia
label1 I like that idea a lot
label1 Wait a minute
label1 But nobody can see
label1 So
label1 So it'd be nice to see
label1 Goddamn it
label1 This is a raid
label1 I can't see, you can't see
label1 So what
label1 All that matters is can the fuckin' horse see
label1 [overlapping shouts]  [man] Sons of bitches
label1 I can't see shit
label1 And get that niggerlover outta the wagon
label1 That nigger ain't down here, Big Daddy
label1 They tricked us
label1 Well, where are they
label1 Auf Wiedersehen
label1 [all shouting]  [horses whinnying]  Oh
label1 [chuckles]  Bull'seye
label1 [men yelling]  [horses whinnying]   [Django] Look at 'em run
label1 [all shouting]  Yeah, cowards tend to do that
label1 Would you care to
label1 Can't see shit outta this
label1 He's getting away
label1 I got him
label1 I got him
label1 [slowmotion impact sound]  [Big Daddy grunting]  Got him
label1 How you know Broomhilda's first masters was German
label1 If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German
label1 Lots of gals where you're from named Broomhilda
label1 Broomhilda is the name of a character  in the most popular of all the German legends
label1 There's a story about Broomhilda
label1 Oh, yes, there is
label1 Do you know it
label1 Would you like me to tell you
label1 She was a daughter of Wotan, god of all gods
label1 Anyway, her father is really mad at her
label1 What she do
label1 I can't exactly remember
label1 She disobeys him in some way
label1 So he puts her on top of the mountain
label1 It's a German legend,  there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere
label1 And he puts a firebreathing dragon there to guard the mountain
label1 And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire
label1 Unless a hero arises brave enough to save her
label1 Does a fella arise
label1 Yes, Django, as a matter of fact, he does
label1 Does Siegfried save her
label1 Quite spectacularly so
label1 He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it
label1 He slays the dragon, because he's not afraid of him
label1 I know how he feel
label1 I think I'm just starting to realize that
label1 Now, look, Django..
label1 ...I don't doubt that one day you'll save your lady love...  ...but I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscience
label1 A slave auction town in Mississippi isn't the place for you to visit
label1 Free or not, it's just too dangerous
label1 How do you like the bounty hunting business
label1 Kill white folks and they pay you for it
label1 What's not to like
label1 Now, I have to admit, we make a good team
label1 Yeah, on that occasion you were a tad overzealous,  but normally, that's a good thing
label1 How'd you like to partner up for the winter
label1 What you mean "partner up"
label1 ...I give you a third of my bounties
label1 So we make some money this winter, and when the snow melts,  I'll take you to Greenville myself  and we'll find where they sent your wife
label1 Why you care what happen to me
label1 Frankly..
label1 ...I've never given anybody their freedom before
label1 And now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you
label1 As a German, I'm obliged to help you on your quest  to rescue your beloved Broomhilda
label1 Ooh
label1 What happened to Mr. "I Wanna Shoot White Folks For Money"
label1 His son's with him
label1 Well, good
label1 He'll have a loved one with him
label1 Maybe even share a last word
label1 That's better than most of them get
label1 Put down the rifle
label1 Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill
label1 Read it aloud
label1 Consider that today's lesson
label1 Dead or alive
label1 Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall   [Schultz] Gang
label1 "Gang.
label1 "For murder and stagecoach...  ...robbery
label1 Sevenzerozerozero
label1 Seven thousand
label1 Thousand
label1 "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall
label1 $1,500 for each of his...  .“gang“P   Mem...  "Members
label1 Known members of the Smitty Bacall Gang are as follas:"   Follows
label1 "Follows.
label1 "Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and..."  Crazy Craig Koons
label1 If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at 22,  they would never have printed that
label1 But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches  and he didn't mind killing people to do it
label1 Do you want to save your wife by doing what I do
label1 I kill people and sell their corpses for cash
label1 This corpse is worth $7,000
label1 Now quit your pussyfooting and shoot him
label1 Pa
label1 Here
label1 You need to keep this Smitty Bacall handbill
label1 Why
label1 It's good luck
label1 You always keep the handbill of your first bounty

label1 "Broomhilda Von Shaft
label1 Age 27
label1 Calvin Candie
label1 He owns the fourth biggest cotton plantation in Mississippi: Candyland
label1 Candyland
label1 Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland
label1 Well, apparently, that's where your wife is...   [sighs]  ...and that's the repellant gentleman  who owns her
label1 Let's just hope she works in the house, not in the field
label1 Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger
label1 She... she pretty
label1 And she talk good, too
label1 [sizzling]  [screaming]  She ain't no field nigger but she ain't good enough  for the house no more either
label1 What's a comfort...
label1 Oh
label1 Not while I got freedom
label1 Not while I got my gun
label1 So do we offer to buy her
label1 Needs to buy a horse
label1 He walks up to the farmer's farm, and he knocks on the farmer's door  and asks the farmer to buy his horse
label1 And do you know what the farmer says
label1 The farmer says no
label1 Well, I say fuck that farmer, and I'm stealin' that horse
label1 Fair enough
label1 Not to mention the horse goes back to its original owner  because the horse is still his property
label1 We need her and we need a bill of sale
label1 May I offer an alternative plan of action
label1 Go ahead
label1 So... the man walks up to the farmer's farm,  he knocks on the farmer's door...  ...and asks not to buy the horse, but the farm
label1 And makes an offer so ridiculous,  the farmer is forced to say yes
label1 No, it's far too big
label1 But apparently this farmer ain't all about the farm
label1 How much do you know about Mandingo fighting
label1 What
label1 Why
label1 <i>[Schultz] Because my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,</i>  <i>here in Greenville to buy my way into the Mandingo fight game.</i>  <i>And your character is a Mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.</i>  <i>[Django] They call that "OneEyed Charley
label1 "</i>  Bonjour
label1 We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie
label1 <i>Entraz.</i>   Thank you
label1 Hmmm
label1 You want me to play a black slaver
label1 A black slaver is lower than the head house nigger...  ...and, buddy, that's pretty fuckin' low
label1 Then play him that way
label1 Give me your black slaver
label1 Toot
label1 Peanut butter!</i>   Dr. Schultz

label1 One could almost say youse a nigger
label1 What did you say
label1 I said..
label1 Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie that I should know before I meet him
label1 Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile
label1 What civilized people aren't
label1 He doesn't speak French
label1 Don't speak French to him, it'll embarrass him
label1 There you go
label1 There you go
label1 Why do you want to get in the Mandingo business
label1 You don't intend to allow your second to make the proper introductions
label1 Quit stalling, now

label1 Django
label1 Can you spell it
label1 The D is silent
label1 I know
label1 take care of my new boy here
label1 You find him a room with a soft bed,  then you bring him up a pony to lick his pole
label1 But you be ready to travel to Candyland tomorrow morning, now, ya hear
label1 Before you go, Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer
label1 You enjoy that, boy
label1 You've earned it
label1 Yessir
label1 What's your name, boy
label1 His name is Django Freeman
label1 Where'd you dig him up
label1 I've heard tell about you
label1 I heard you been telling everybody them Mandingos ain't no damn good
label1 Ain't nothin' nobody is sellin' is worth buyin'
label1 I'm curious... what makes you such a Mandingo expert
label1 What did you say, boy
label1 No offense given...  ...none taken
label1 ...I'd appreciate if you could direct your line of inquiry toward me
label1 One...  ...you do not have anything to drink
label1 Yes
label1 I'll have a beer
label1 Wunderbar
label1 Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard,  and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver
label1 Do not spare the rum
label1 Doc..
label1 I am a seasoned slaver
label1 You are, well, you are a neophyte
label1 With all due respect, Monsieur Candie..
label1 I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger  at above topdollar market price
label1 Now I was under the impression, when you granted me an audience,  it would be to discuss business
label1 Well, we weren't talkin' business yet
label1 Thank you
label1 go outside and play
label1 Sheba... you stay right there
label1 I know you didn't mean me
label1 German
label1 Now, according to Moguy, if I do business with you,  I'm doing business with both y'all
label1 He does the eyeballin', you the billfold
label1 Is that it
label1 Well, you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yeah
label1 Hm
label1 So..
label1 Not for top dollar
label1 Well, then, we got nothin' more to talk about
label1 You see, you wanna buy a beatass nigger from me,  those are the beatass niggers I wanna sell so..
label1 He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell
label1 Well, I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell
label1 Well, you won't sell your best
label1 You won't even sell your second best
label1 You don't want to sell him either
label1 But if I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be forced to consider it...  ...who knows what could happen
label1 And what do you consider ridiculous
label1 How much would you say, Django
label1 Twelve thousand dollars
label1 Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,  but now you have my attention
label1 Willie
label1 Willie
label1 Hold up
label1 Ah
label1 Good morning, gentlemen
label1 Good Dr. Schultz
label1 Beautiful morning, isn't it
label1 You couldn't have picked a better one
label1 You can tie your horse up back there
label1 Where I part company from many of my phrenologist colleagues  is I believe there is a level above bright, above talented,  above loyal that a nigger can aspire to
label1 Say, one nigger that just pops up in 10,000
label1 The exceptional nigger
label1 Bright day, huh, Bright Boy
label1 Sun is up
label1 [Calvin] Have a seat, doc
label1 [Schultz] Thank you
label1 The honor is all ours
label1 Thank you
label1 <i>[Calvin] But I do believe that, given time,</i>  exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here...  ...become if not frequent...  ...more frequent
label1 Bright Boy, you are that one in 10,000
label1 The name of the game is keep up, not catch up, nigger
label1 Whoa
label1 [whinnying]   Touch your guns, you die
label1 Now I saw the whole thing
label1 Are you kidding me
label1 This nigger just..
label1 I said no harm done
label1 Now take your hand off your pistol
label1 Butch, that means you too
label1 Hoot
label1 Get back up on your horse
label1 He broke my collarbone
label1 For God's sake, somebody please help Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse
label1 [man] Yessir, boss
label1 Oh, now you are one lucky nigger
label1 Oh, I'm gonna go walking in the moonlight with you
label1 You wanna hold my hand
label1 Willie, take us home
label1 Head 'em out
label1 You got a problem with your eyeball, boy
label1 You want a boot heel in it
label1 No, sir
label1 Then you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me
label1 You flash that bad look at me again, I'll give you a reason not to like me
label1 You niggers are gonna understand something about me
label1 You get the molasses out your ass, you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me
label1 He is a rambunctious sort, ain't he
label1 [chuckles]  Indeed
label1 May we stop for a moment so I may put a word in my man's ear
label1 You know, I'm expecting to fall in love once I see the specimens at Candyland,  so before that moment, it would be good if I could have  a confidential strategy meeting with my confidant
label1 You mind telling me what the hell you doing
label1 You're sure it's her
label1 Now, while it's not wise to assume,  in this instance, I think it's pretty safe
label1 Point being, don't get so carried away with your retribution
label1 You lose sight of why we're here
label1 You think I lost sight of that
label1 Yes, I do
label1 You're going to blow this whole charade, or more than likely get us both killed
label1 And I, for one, don't intend to die in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA
label1 I'm not antagonizing him
label1 I'm intriguing him
label1 You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves
label1 I recall the man who had me kill another man in front of his son  and he didn't bat a eye
label1 You remember that
label1 What you said was that this is my world...  ...and in my world you gotta get dirty
label1 So that's what I'm doing
label1 Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...  ...that was the general gist
label1 See you at Candyland
label1 All right, niggers, back at it
label1 That means you too, Moonlight
label1 I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie
label1 You might not be able to win, but your ass can fight
label1 Mr. Stonesipher, would you please shut these goddamn dogs up
label1 I cannot hear myself think
label1 Quiet down, Marsha
label1 Marsha
label1 Hush up
label1 Hey
label1 Come on now, boy... get on out that tree
label1 Yessir
label1 How long was he loose
label1 Day
label1 Half the other night
label1 How far he get off the property
label1 'Bout 20 miles off the prop
label1 Hm
label1 Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday
label1 Onea this new lot
label1 Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian wouldn't bet a bead on him
label1 Candie, I ain't got it in me no more
label1 I can't...  Now, no beggin'
label1 No playin' on my soft heart
label1 You in trouble now, son
label1 Yessir
label1 I done paid $500 for you
label1 When I pay $500, then I expect to get five fights out of a nigger   'fore he roll over and play dead
label1 You got to understand that I'm runnin' a business here
label1 But I won every one
label1 Yes, you did
label1 Yes, you did
label1 But that last one, you muddled the line between winnin' and losin'
label1 Yessir
label1 Still, the fact remains:  I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights
label1 What about my $500
label1 You gonna reimburse me
label1 You even know what "reimburse" means
label1 [laughing]  [Calvin] Huh
label1 You Will
label1 Yep
label1 You'll pay $500  for practically a oneeyed old Joe ain't fit to push a broom
label1 He just tired of you toyin' with him is all
label1 Matter of fact, so am I
label1 But we ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny
label1 Ain't that right, doc
label1 You heard him
label1 You're gonna have to excuse Mr. Stonesipher's slackjawed gaze
label1 He ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life
label1 That right
label1 ...nor have I
label1 Now...  ...seein' as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here...  ...you won't mind me handlin' this nigger any way I see fit
label1 Mr. Stonesipher
label1 Let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven
label1 Marsha
label1 Marsha, hey, get him
label1 [barks echoing]  Get 'im, get 'im
label1 Yeah
label1 Whoo
label1 [dogs snarling]  [screaming]  Your boss looks a little green around the gills  for a blood sport like nigger fighting
label1 Nah, he just ain't used to seein' a man ripped apart by dogs is all
label1 Hm
label1 I'm just a little more used to Americans than he is
label1 Hm
label1 We rode five hours so you could show off your stock
label1 Let's get to it
label1 'Cause as of now, if he's an example, I ain't impressed
label1 Follow me
label1 Line 'em up to the left here now, boy
label1 Stand up straight, now
label1 Get up there, boy
label1 Come on
label1 Give me a line
label1 Give me a line
label1 Get in line there
label1 Straighten up
label1 Stephen, my boy
label1 Hello, my ass
label1 Who this nigger up on that nag
label1 Stephen, you have nails for breakfast
label1 What'sa matter
label1 Why you so ornery
label1 You miss me, huh
label1 [laughs]  I miss you like a hog miss slop
label1 Like a baby miss mammy's titty
label1 [all chuckling]  I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe
label1 Hey, Snowball
label1 Wanna know my name or the name of my horse, you ask me
label1 I'll snatch your black ass off that nag there   and in the mud so fast...  Whoa, whoa, whoa
label1 ...make your head spin
label1 Stephen, Stephen, Stephen
label1 Let's keep it funny
label1 Django here's a free man
label1 That nigger there
label1 Let me at least introduce the two of you
label1 Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen
label1 Stephen, this here's Django
label1 You two oughta hate each other
label1 Django and his friend in gray here, Dr. Schultz, are customers
label1 And they are our guests, Stephen
label1 And you, you old decrepit bastard, oughta show them every hospitality
label1 You understand that
label1 Him I understand
label1 But I don't know why I got to take lip off this nigger
label1 Do you understand
label1 Yessir
label1 I understand
label1 Well,good
label1 Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready
label1 He gonna stay in The Big House
label1 Stephen, he's a slaver
label1 It's different
label1 In The Big House
label1 Well, you got a problem with that
label1 I ain't got no problem with it,  if you ain't got no problem with burnin' the bed, the sheets,  the pillowcases, everything else when this blackass motherfucker's gone
label1 That is my problem
label1 They are mine to burn
label1 Now your problem right now is makin' a good impression
label1 And I want you to start solvin' that problem right now  and get them goddamn rooms ready
label1 Go on, now
label1 Can't believe you brought a nigger to stay in The Big House
label1 Your daddy rollin' over in his goddamned grave
label1 Man, the lip on him
label1 He's gettin' worse and worse
label1 Now...  Where is my beautiful sister?
label1 Whoohoohoohoo
label1 Dr. Schultz, this attractive Southern belle is my widowed sister
label1 Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes
label1 May I present to you Lara Lee CandieFitzwilly
label1 Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly
label1 Y'all get your ass over by that pen
label1 Come on, Charly
label1 Let's go
label1 Like you on a rope
label1 Niggers don't walk around here, niggers run
label1 Monsieur Candie
label1 Hm
label1 Yeah
label1 Nigger gal
label1 Yeah, I believe you mentioned she spoke German
label1 Ah, yes
label1 Do you think before the demonstration, you could send her around to my room
label1 I don't see why not
label1 Stephen, when you get through showin' them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,  get her cleaned up and smellin' real nice,  and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room here
label1 Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,  there'sa somethin' I ain't told you 'bout yet
label1 What
label1 [stammers] Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box
label1 She bein' punished
label1 [Calvin] What she do
label1 [Stephen] She run off again
label1 Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people ran away while I was gone
label1 Two
label1 They brung her back this morning
label1 How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up
label1 they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass
label1 Bill and Cody went lookin' for her, found her, brung her back
label1 But she done that to her own damn self  runnin' through them damn bushes and shit
label1 How long she been in the box
label1 she been in there
label1 All damn day
label1 And the little bitch got ten more days to be in there
label1 Still, take her out
label1 Why
label1 Because I said so, that's why
label1 Dr. Schultz is my guest
label1 Hildi is my nigger
label1 Southern hospitality dictates I make her available to him
label1 Jesus Christ, Stephen
label1 What is the point of havin' a nigger that speaks German  if you can't wheel 'em out when you have a German guest
label1 Yessir
label1 Will you and Cora be responsible  for gettin' Hildi cleaned up and presentable for Dr. Schultz here
label1 Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am weary from our travels beyond words
label1 It is time for me to rest my tired eyes
label1 Y'all done heard the man
label1 Get her ass up outta there
label1 Come here
label1 Shoots
label1 Schultz
label1 Schultz
label1 Get her back over here
label1 Hurry up, girl
label1 Yessir
label1 [soft guitar music plays]   Come on, girl
label1 Stand up
label1 Hello, ladies
label1 May I introduce to you Broomhilda
label1 Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz
label1 It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda
label1 I've heard a lot of good things about you
label1 Well, it's not every nigger speaks German, don't ya know
label1 [chuckles]  [forced chuckle]  As I look at you now, Broomhilda,  I can see all the passions you inspire are completely justified
label1 The doctor here speaks German
label1 Go ahead, girl
label1 Speak a little German
label1 Ha
label1 [laughs]  Astonishing
label1 Hm
label1 Pardon
label1 <i>Danke.</i>    Hey, Little Trouble Maker
label1 You silvertongued devil, you
label1 Hurry up, girl
label1 These ready, Miss Cora
label1 Go downstairs, get the big jug with the red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear
label1 Get your big pretty ass out the way
label1 You know you like it
label1 Ooh
label1 Come on with these biscuits, girl
label1 Look, Monsieur Candie, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it
label1 But the best three by far were Samson...   What's that other one's name
label1 Goldie
label1 Goldie
label1 By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe
label1 these nigger nicknames get started
label1 His name was Joe, maybe one day he said he was cold
label1 Who knows
label1 We all know that
label1 You will never sell him, and I can see why
label1 He's a champion
label1 All three are champions
label1 Samson's the champion
label1 Them other two pretty good
label1 It's all right
label1 You have to understand, Monsieur Candie,  while admittedly a neophyte in the nigger fight game,  I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus
label1 Is that right
label1 Hence, I have big ideas when it comes to presentation
label1 I need something more than just a big nigger
label1 Yeah, he needs to have panache
label1 Need to have what
label1 What
label1 Panache
label1 Uh...   A sense of Showmanship
label1 Showmanship, yes
label1 More like Niggerles
label1 I said, and I quote: "I would pay top dollar for...  ...'the right nigger."
label1 Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger, per se
label1 But is he right as rain
label1 Oh, Dr. Schultz,  I will have you know there is no one in the nigger fight game  that appreciates the value of showmanship  more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie here
label1 Nobody
label1 But one must not forget the most important thing   in the nigger fight game
label1 And that is a nigger that can win fights
label1 Hmmm
label1 Now that should be your first, second, third, fourth, and fifth concern
label1 Now, after you have that, and you know you have that,  then you can start to implement a grand design
label1 First thing's first
label1 Ooh
label1 I see you two gettin' on
label1 Famously
label1 Well, hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston
label1 Two weeks in Boston
label1 Monsieur Candie, you a mess
label1 [coughing]   I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue
label1 And Hildi is a charming conversation companion
label1 Hm
label1 a powerful emotion, boy
label1 [Stephen] Hm
label1 It's like a pool of black tar
label1 Once it catches your ass, you're caught
label1 Yessir, you stuck
label1 [laughs]   You can lay on all the German sweet talk you want,  but it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django
label1 Well, naturally
label1 You are quite the dapper European gentleman
label1 you got to put your elbow in these dishes, you hear me
label1 You know that nigger, don't you
label1 Who
label1 "Who?
label1 You know who I'm talkin' about
label1 At the table
label1 I don't know him
label1 No
label1 "No," what
label1 No, sir
label1 You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you
label1 If you say so
label1 Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it
label1 But if it was my money, I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him
label1 What would your price be
label1 Well, if I was inclined to be generous...  ...and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous...  ...9,000
label1 Maybe
label1 You see, it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger
label1 Sure wasn't
label1 It was you who approached me to buy one
label1 Sure was
label1 And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that,   I could do so any day of the week
label1 Any day
label1 But, like you said in Greenville, doctor..
label1 I don't want to sell him
label1 It was only your ridiculous offer of $12,000   that made me even consider it
label1 Hmmm
label1 Monsieur Candie, you have a deal
label1 Eskimo Joe, $12,000
label1 [banging table] Hooray, doctor
label1 Hooray
label1 However, that is a tremendous amount of money
label1 And the way you have your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer
label1 Persnickety man named Tuttle
label1 Hmmm
label1 Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined   by a physician of my choosing
label1 [Calvin] Naturally
label1 So, say I return in about...   ...five days time
label1 Five days
label1 And then my Mr. Tuttle and your Mr. Moguy  can hash out the finer details between themselves
label1 Splendid
label1 Gentlemen...  ...may I propose a toast
label1 To Eskimo Joe
label1 Or shall we call him The Black Hercules
label1 To The Black Hercules
label1 You was right, doctor
label1 That name do have panass
label1 [chuckles]  Hm
label1 Hildi, top my drink off
label1 When Monsieur Candie talk to you, you answers
label1 I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie
label1 Hmmm
label1 It's a lot better than sizzlin' in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass  through a bramble bush
label1 But maybe it's not quite as much fun as gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,   huh, sugar bear
label1 Oh, Lord, she like them niggers
label1 Like Samson
label1 You know, Monsieur Candie,  the doctor here might be interested in seein' Hildi's peeled back,  seein' as how they don't have many niggers where he come from
label1 Dr. Schultz, when you was alone with Hildi, here,  did you just speak German or did you get to take her clothes off
label1 No, we just talked and...  haven't seen her back
label1 I haven't...  No, no, no, no
label1 Stephen's right, you might find this interesting
label1 Hildi, go on, take off your dress
label1 Show Dr. Schultz your back here
label1 [Lara Lee] Uh, Calvin
label1 I just got her all dressed up and lookin' nice
label1 They don't got niggers there
label1 He is a man of medicine
label1 I'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers' endurance for pain
label1 These niggers are tough, Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it
label1 Lara Lee just get one, she'd lose her goddamn mind
label1 [Stephen] Sure would
label1 It's like a paintin'
label1 Look at that
label1 Calvin
label1 We are eating
label1 Ain't no one wanna look at her whipped up back
label1 [exhales]  Fine
label1 Fine, fine, fine, fine
label1 After dinner, then, Stephen
label1 Cora, come get this girl
label1 [Lara Lee] She a mess
label1 Yes, ma'am
label1 [gasps] Oh
label1 Why are you all undone
label1 Come on in here
label1 Baby, you on Stephen bad side, and you need to be on his blind side
label1 You say you ain't know him
label1 Huh
label1 I said, you said you ain't know him
label1 I don't
label1 Yes, you do
label1 ...I don't
label1 Why is you lying to me
label1 I ain't
label1 You scarin' me
label1 Why is I'm scaring you
label1 Because you scary
label1 this afternoon with Hildi  was positively soulenriching
label1 You stay right here
label1 you'd be willing to part with Hildi
label1 Yessiree bob, I did
label1 In that case, allow me to propose another proposition
label1 I'm all ears
label1 Hurry up, goddamn it
label1 You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here
label1 My ears ain't worth a damn these days
label1 Excuse him
label1 Monsieur Candie, could I get a word with you in the kitchen
label1 You mean get up out of my chair
label1 If'n you could manage it
label1 It's about dessert
label1 What about dessert
label1 I'd rather discuss that in private
label1 We're having white cake
label1 You right, Monsieur Candie
label1 You right
label1 I'll handle it myself
label1 I just can't understand why you won't come talk to these niggers
label1 Shit get fucked up around here, you blame me
label1 Fine
label1 Friend Stephen, I will be along momentarily
label1 Yessir
label1 Well, gentlemen, as you can see,  talented as they are, no doubt, in the kitchen,  from time to time, adult supervision is required
label1 the dinner service
label1 Get
label1 Hurry up, girl
label1 What is the matter
label1 They wants that girl
label1 [chuckling]  Stephen, what the hell are you talking about
label1 Hm
label1 They playing your ass for a fool is what I'm talking about
label1 They ain't here for no musclebound Jimmie
label1 Wh... What girl
label1 Hildi
label1 Yeah, Hildi
label1 Her and Django, them niggers know each other
label1 He just bought Eskimo Joe
label1 Did he give you any money
label1 Not yet
label1 Not yet, nohow
label1 But he's just about to buy  who he come here to buy when I interrupted him
label1 "Thank you, Stephen.
label1 You're welcome, Calvin
label1 Why would they go through all that trouble for a nigger  with a chewed up back, ain't worth $300
label1 They doin' it 'cause that nigger Django's in love with Hildi
label1 She probably his wife
label1 Now, why that German gives a fuck who that uppity son of a bitch  is in love with, I'm sure I don't know
label1 If she's who they want...  ...why this whole snake oil pitch about Mandingos, then
label1 But that 12,000
label1 That made you real friendly, now, didn't it
label1 Yes, it did
label1 His wife, huh
label1 Those lying...  ...goddamn timewastin' sons of bitches
label1 Sons of bitches
label1 ...out of New Orleans, so I have quite a bit of practice with theater types
label1 Oh, there you are
label1 I was beginning to think that you and that old crow run off together
label1 Lara Lee, I was just looking out the big window
label1 Billy Crash is out there dealing with some shady slaver  trying to sell a passel of ponies
label1 Would you be a dear, go out there and give them gals an eyeball
label1 Hm
label1 Of course, brother
label1 Thank you, darling
label1 Business never sleeps
label1 Hmmm
label1 Apropos, before your exit,  we were discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda
label1 Ah, yes
label1 And we will again
label1 In a moment
label1 Who's your little friend
label1 He's a old Joe that lived around here for a long time
label1 And I do mean a long damn time
label1 Till he up and keeled over one day...  ...Old Ben took care of me
label1 Growing up the son of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi  puts a white man in contact with a whole lotta black faces
label1 I spent my whole life here, right here in Candyland...  ...surrounded by black faces
label1 Now, seeing them every day, day in, day out,  I only had one question:   Why don't they kill us
label1 Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda cut my daddy's goddamn throat  and it wouldn't have taken me no 50 years to do it, neither
label1 But he never did
label1 Why not
label1 You see, the science of phrenology  is crucial to understanding the separation of our two species
label1 In the skull of the African here,  the area associated with submissiveness  is larger than any human or any other subhuman species on planet Earth
label1 Here, here and here
label1 Now...  ...if I was holding the skull of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,  these three dimples would be found in the area of the skull  most associated with... creativity
label1 But this is the skull of Old Ben
label1 And in the skull of Old Ben,  unburdened by genius,  these three dimples exist in the area of the skull most associated with...  ...servility
label1 Now, Bright Boy..
label1 But if I took this hammer here...  ...and I bashed in your skull with it...  ...you would have the same three dimples in the same place...  ...as Old Ben
label1 Hey
label1 If you lift those palms off that turtle shell tabletop,  Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawedoff
label1 There have been a lot of lies said around this dinner table here tonight,  but that you can believe
label1 Mr. Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect the pistol  hanging off these boys' hips here
label1 Thank you ever so much
label1 Where were we
label1 Jackass
label1 Ah, yes
label1 I do believe you were just getting ready to make me  a proposition to buy Broomhilda
label1 Right
label1 Bring out Hildi
label1 Get over there yonder
label1 [screams]  Sit your ass in that goddamn...  flat on that tabletop
label1 To which me myself said, "What is your definition of ridiculous?
label1 To which you said, "$12,000.
label1 [yells]  Now, considering y'all  have ridden a whole lot of miles,  went through a whole lot of trouble, and done spread a whole lot of bull  to purchase this lovely lady right here,  it would appear that Broomhilda is, in fact... the right nigger
label1 And if y'all want to leave Candyland with Broomhilda,  the price is $12,000
label1 Yes, I do, doctor
label1 You see, under the laws of Chickasaw County,  Broomhilda here is my property
label1 And I can choose to do with my property whatever I so desire
label1 And if y'all think my price...  ...for this nigger here is too steep...   [grunts]  ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...  ...take this goddamn hammer here and beat her ass to death with it
label1 Right in front of both y'all
label1 Then we can examine the three dimples inside Broomhilda's skull
label1 Now, what's it gonna be, doc
label1 Huh
label1 May I lift the hands off the tabletop in order to remove my billfold
label1 Yes, you may
label1 That 12
label1 [screaming]  To the man with the exceptional beard  and his unexceptional nigger
label1 Mr. Moguy
label1 Yes, Calvin
label1 Will you make these gentlemen a receipt for $12,000, please
label1 $12,000
label1 It was a pleasure doing business with y'all
label1 Now, gentlemen...  ...if you care to join me in the parlor...  ...we will be serving white cake
label1 Excuse me
label1 Could you please stop playing Beethoven
label1 Take your hands off the harp
label1 Doctor, you can't go in there
label1 Stephen, Stephen
label1 Let it be
label1 He's just a little upset, that's all
label1 I'll handle this
label1 White cake
label1 I don't go in for sweets, thank you
label1 Hm
label1 Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today
label1 D'Artagnan
label1 And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this
label1 Come again
label1 He wrote The <i>Three</i> Musketeers
label1 Yes, of course, doctor
label1 I figured you must be an admirer
label1 You named your slave after his novel's lead character
label1 Now, if Alexandre Dumas had been there today,  I wonder what he would have made of it
label1 You doubt he'd approve, huh
label1 His approval would be a dubious proposition at best
label1 Softhearted Frenchie
label1 Alexandre Dumas is black
label1 Are these Broomhilda's papers
label1 Of course
label1 Thank you
label1 That is her bill of sale, her ownership history,  and, of course, her freedom papers, doctor
label1 Would you have ink and pen for me
label1 Right over there on that little table
label1 Thank you
label1 Broomhilda Von Shaft...  ...consider yourself a free woman
label1 Mr. Candie...  ...normally, I would say auf Wiedersehen
label1 But since what auf Wiedersehen actually means is "till I see you again"  and since I never wish to see you again,  to you, sir..
label1 I say, "goodbye.
label1 Let's go
label1 Come on
label1 What
label1 It's a custom here in the South...  ...once a business deal is concluded that the two parties shake hands
label1 It implies good faith
label1 But you are...  ...in my house, doctor
label1 So I'm afraid I must insist
label1 On what
label1 That I shake your hand
label1 Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction
label1 You know what I think you are
label1 What you think I am
label1 I think you are a bad loser
label1 And I think you're an abysmal winner
label1 Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw County, a deal ain't done  until the two parties have shook hands
label1 Even after all that paper signin', don't mean shit...  ...you don't shake my hand
label1 If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away $12,000
label1 I don't think so
label1 If she tries to leave here before this niggerloving German shakes my hand,  you cut her ass down
label1 You really want me to shake your hand
label1 I insist
label1 If you insist
label1 Calvin
label1 I'm sorry
label1 I couldn't resist
label1 Ni99er's gone crazy
label1 Help
label1 [screaming]  Help, he's killing everyone
label1 [gunshot]  [Screaming]  Ah
label1 Shit
label1 Get the...
label1 [screaming continues]   What...
label1 Fucking...  Goddamn it
label1 What the fuck is going on
label1 [screams]  You shot me
label1 [man] Sorry, Jessie
label1 Who the fuck gave a nigger a goddamn gun
label1 Nigger
label1 Motherfucker
label1 Shit
label1 Shit
label1 Hold your fire
label1 Stop shootin', goddamn it
label1 What
label1 We got your woman
label1 Billy Crash here got his pistol upside her head
label1 [gasping]  You don't stop all that carrying on,   he gonna blow her goddamn brains out
label1 [gasping]  And that ain't no threat, horse boy
label1 That there is a promise
label1 Or...  ...you can give up, throw your gun out...   ...we won't kill Hildi
label1 Honest lnjun, Django
label1 I swear 'fore God
label1 You give up, ain't no harm gonna come to her
label1 And I'm supposed to believe your black ass
label1 I believe if you don't give up in the next ten seconds,  we gonna blow this bitch's brains out
label1 Believe that
label1 Don't do it
label1 [sniffling] You give me up
label1 Just let me go
label1 Seven
label1 [Hildi] Django
label1 [Stephen] Eight
label1 I love you
label1 [Django] Hold it
label1 No
label1 <i>L</i> give UP  I can't hear you, nigger
label1 I said I give up
label1 [sobbing]  No
label1 Cockadoodledo, nigger
label1 So y'all bounty hunters, huh
label1 We found your wanted posters...  ...and book of figures in your saddlebags
label1 I got to say..
label1 ...I ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before
label1 Black boy paid to kill white men
label1 How'd you like that line of work
label1 Probably pretty good while it lasted, huh
label1 Time to say good night to them nuts, blackie
label1 [yelling]  On three
label1 Two...   [screaming]  Calm down, now, here it comes
label1 [screaming] " [Stephen] Captain
label1 Miss Lara want to see you
label1 Something to do with the Old Man's funeral
label1 She gonna give him to the LeQuint Dickey people
label1 Well, she didn't waste a minute telling me
label1 This here what you take with you
label1 Your black ass has been all them motherfuckers at The Big House  could talk about for the last few hours
label1 Now, mind you, most of them ideas had to do with fuckin' with your fun parts
label1 Now, that may seem like a good idea, but truth is...  ...when you snip a nigger's nuts,  most of them bleed out in, oh, about, hm... seven minutes
label1 Most of 'em
label1 Well, more than most
label1 Then I says: "Shitfire
label1 The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that.
label1 Or "Throw him to the Mandingos.
label1 "Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs.
label1 We do that shit all the time
label1 Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that.
label1 Lo and behold,  out of nowhere, Miss Lara come up with the bright idea  of giving your ass to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company
label1 And as a slave of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,  henceforth, till the day you die,  all day, every day,  you will be swinging a sledgehammer,  turning big rocks into little rocks
label1 One word of sass, they cuts out your tongue
label1 And they good at it too
label1 You won't bleed out
label1 Oh, they does that real good
label1 They gonna work ya
label1 All day, every day, till your back give out
label1 Then they're gonna hit you in the head with a hammer,  throw your ass down the nigger hole
label1 the golden rule, Frankie, eh
label1 You don't root abos
label1 Hey, white boy
label1 I said, hey, white boy
label1 Shut up, black
label1 Do what, now
label1 I said how'd you like to make $11,000
label1 11,500, actually
label1 What the fuck are you talking about
label1 And y'all rode right past it
label1 You be damned, blackie, we're not bandits
label1 I ain't saying that
label1 Nice thing about this fortune is it ain't illegal
label1 You got to earn it, white boy
label1 You got something to say, mate, you say it
label1 The $11,500 fortune waitin' for you back at Candyland  is in the form of a "Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty  on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang
label1 Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall
label1 Smitty Bacall is the leader of this murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,  the Bacall Gang
label1 There's a $7,000 "Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,  $1,500 for each of his three accomplices:  Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,  and Crazy Craig Koons
label1 Now, all four of them gentlemen,  they back there at Candyland laughing their ass off
label1 'Cause they just got away with murder
label1 But it ain't got to be that way
label1 You and your mates, y'all can ride back there and y'all can go get that money
label1 What'd these jokers do again
label1 These sons of bitches, they killed innocent people
label1 Innocent white people
label1 I got the handbill right here in my pocket, if you let me get it
label1 Get it out
label1 [man 2] But you're a slave
label1 [man 1] "...and stagecoach robbery.
label1 Do I sound like a fuckin' slave
label1 [man 1] "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall.
label1 Hm
label1 [man 2] That's a shitload
label1 I'm a bounty hunter
label1 Yesterday, as a free man,  I rode into Candyland on a horse with my German white partner,  Dr. King Schultz
label1 We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way from Texas to Chickasaw County
label1 But y'all know I ain't on that manifest
label1 And all y'all know I ain't supposed to be on this trip
label1 But them four men is still back there, they're still wanted,  and that 11,500 is up for grabs, and the last thing they'd expect  is y'all ridin' back in there and gettin' it
label1 You tell us who they are and we turn you loose
label1 No,no,no,no
label1 I ain't gonna tell you who they are
label1 But, you give me a pistol, one of them horses,  and $500 of that 11,500, and I'll point 'em out to you
label1 Now just 'cause it's a real handbill  doesn't mean that other bunch of malarkey is
label1 Now why would a slave have a "Wanted Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket
label1 Did that black ride into Candyland yesterday
label1 All right, I'm gonna ask you again
label1 I want you to remember, I don't like liars
label1 Yeah
label1 They walked us from the Greenville auction,  and he rode in on a horse with a white man
label1 He weren't no slave
label1 You fuckin' sure about that
label1 Damn sure
label1 What happened over in Candyland
label1 Massa got shot
label1 Who shot him
label1 The German
label1 Why'd he do that
label1 Nigger and the German was actin' like they were slavers but they wasn't
label1 Bounty hunters
label1 Fuck me, Roy
label1 I mean, this could be big, mate
label1 Well, smoke, you got a deal
label1 I got one more condition
label1 Hey... [laughs]  ...you're a funny bugger
label1 Cut him loose
label1 Yeah, yeah
label1 You got yourself a deal, blackie

label1 Oh, yeah
label1 There we go
label1 There you go, mate
label1 Yeah
label1 What them saddlebags got in 'em
label1 Dynamite
label1 No
label1 I can understand that
label1 Frankie, why don't you take them sticks off that horse  and stick 'em in the nigger cage
label1 A little dynamite for you black fellas to play with
label1 Yeah, right
label1 Why don't you give him your gun and gun belt
label1 Righto
label1 Now, don't drop the fuckin' thing, all right
label1 I've just had the sights fixed and they're perfect
label1 Oh, that's good to know
label1 [all yelling]  [horses whinnying]   Throw me up that dynamite

label1 But you know, fuck, you know, I just would like a little consideration
label1 The Dog Catcher
label1 The Dog Catcher, Chester
label1 That's the good stuff
label1 Now, take a look at some of these goodies you brought us, okay
label1 Um, ff ar be it Far be it for me, uh, Chester  Uhhuh
label1 But I was just wondering if you could tell me, what is all that stuff f or
label1 Hey, one thing at a time, man
label1 I'm not a frog, and you're not a bunny
label1 So let's not jump ahead

label1 That is mine
label1 And... a hatchet
label1 Well, sir Chester you be the judge
label1 I'll be the judge
label1 Careful, sir
label1 What do you think
label1 lt's a sharp motherfucker
label1 Forget the nails and the twine
label1 Bring all this other bullshit over to the bar
label1 Let's go
label1 Pronto, man
label1 You heard him, Ted
label1 Go ahead
label1 Right you are, sir
label1 Yeah

label1 You know that

label1 Oh, you are my fuckin' hero
label1 They better, after talkin' about it all night
label1 I wanna see a show
label1 Give me your motherfuckin'  All right then
label1 Well, if that's everything
label1 [Leo] I got Cedars lined up, man

label1 We're gonna walk back...   to this little bar here
label1 I told you to dump her, didn't l
label1 Leo
label1 Sit on this little red stool
label1 All right
label1 Um, sir
label1 Uhhuh
label1 A word in your ear, sir
label1 Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure
label1 Excusezmoi
label1 I treat that bitch like a queen, man
label1 I'm fuckin' working
label1 As long as you don't break up the furniture,  I don't give a fuck what you do
label1 Took all your money
label1 Gonna take your kids and house
label1 As f ar as I'm concerned,  go ahead, trash the place
label1 Oh, but, look, let me explain what we're talkin' about
label1 Sir, sir, you don't have to explain anything to me
label1 Well, no, it's your business too, Ted, because we want you to take part
label1 [Tooting]  Take part in what, sir
label1 Think so
label1 Just spit it out
label1 Okay, okay, here we go
label1 Okay
label1 Thing is, Ted, first off,  there's nothing homosexual about what we want you to do
label1 Nothing, nothing could be further from the truth
label1 Can I just jump in here for a second
label1 No
label1 My kind of way of telling him is kind of going all around the world
label1 But it's the journey that's worth it
label1 Yeah, well, I see that
label1 Why don't you just shut the fuck up, bitch
label1 "Bitch"
label1 Bitch
label1 Uh, excuse me, aren't you the one who's being paid to suck his cock, cork boy
label1 Cork boy, man
label1 Business card
label1 I see a new business card
label1 [Spoon Tapping Glass]  Excuse me, if it please the court
label1 I second the nomination
label1 I move that nomination be closed
label1 Thank you
label1 The court is yours, Leo
label1 Thank you very much, Chester
label1 Ted, you ever seen any of them old Alfred Hitchcock episodes
label1 Yes, sir
label1 You ever see the one called The Man From Rio with Peter Lorre and Steve McQueen
label1 lt's called The Man From Rio with Peter Lorre, Steve McQueen
label1 Now, if Steve McQueen lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a row,  he wins Peter Lorre's new car
label1 But if he does not light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row,  Peter Lorre gets to chop off Steve McQueen's little pinky
label1 Norman and Chester here just made that same bet
label1 Norman has bet his pinky...  that he can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row
label1 lf he does,  he wins Chester's 1964 Chevy Chevelle...  red, fuckin', beautiful car
label1 lf he doesn't, chop off his fuckin' pinky
label1 What do you say
label1 Yes
label1 Of course
label1 Teddy, that's why we're here, but that does not mean...  that we don't know what the fuck we're talking about
label1 I'm gonna tell you what the fuck I'm talkin' about
label1 I'm gonna tell you what the fuck I'm talkin' about
label1 I drive a motherfucking Honda that my sister sold me
label1 You hear what I'm saying
label1 You see this shit
label1 next to America's hottest old car
label1 That's the car I own
label1 Are you listenin' to me
label1 Are you
label1 Goddamn shit
label1 Now you take a good long look at that there machine...  that this motherfucker over here's standin' next to
label1 That's a 1964 niggerred, ragtop Chevy Chevelle
label1 And I love that car more than l love hips, lips or fingertips
label1 When you're drinking champagne, you're drinking champagne
label1 When you're drinking Cristal, you say you're drinking Cristal
label1 Whatever that pissityass thing is, we are drinking it, you know
label1 And we are watching TV
label1 [Murmurs]  What, what
label1 Hey, hey, hey
label1 When all of a sudden,  we flip on Steve McQueen, Peter Lorre being fuckin' badasses
label1 Badass
label1 And I look over at this funnylooking motherfucker over here,  and I say, "I'd do that f or the Chevelle.
label1 I'm funny
label1 And that's when Chester says  "Oh, really?
label1 We already told you we were drunk, Ted
label1 That goes without motherfucking saying
label1 'Cause if we wasn't drunk, we'd probably chicken out
label1 Man, you tell the fuckin' truth
label1 You want to know what the fuckin' truth is
label1 The fuckin' truth is, my lucky Zippo is gonna win me...  Chester's fucking car
label1 Which brings us to your part in this little wager, Ted
label1 I don't have a part, sir
label1 That's it
label1 That's quite brilliant, sir
label1 Thing is, there are some inherent obstacles in this undertaking
label1 Aside from the obvious
label1 First of which is being the f act that I'm not like Peter Lorre on that TV show
label1 I'm not some sick fuck travelin' the countryside collecting fingers
label1 All right, you know, we're all buddies here
label1 We just want to chop it off
label1 You know, if f ate doesn't smile on old Norman,  we'll put that fucker on ice, whisk it right to the hospital,  where in all likelihood they'll be able to sew it right back on
label1 Yeah, well, they sewed that guy's dick back on
label1 They can sew Norman's pinky back on
label1 Yeah, how hard can it be
label1 Yeah, good point
label1 So, Norman, he's, he's taken care of, you know
label1 My interests, on the other hand, have not
label1 I am as emotionally attached to my car as Norman is physically to his finger
label1 That's a very fuckin' piece of expensive machinery I'm putting on this wager
label1 That's fine
label1 That's no problem
label1 I have no problem with that
label1 I'm a big boy
label1 But if I win, l wanna win
label1 All right
label1 lf Norman lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a fuckin' row,  he's gonna have no emotional problems whatsoever about taking my car keys
label1 [Murmurs]  But if I win,  well, it's not inconceivable that at the last minute...  maybe neither Leo or l...  will be able to... wield the axe
label1 A hatchet, sir
label1 Which brings us full circle to you, Ted
label1 [Glass Clatters On Bar]  Cleareyed Ted
label1 Sober Ted
label1 Completestranger Ted
label1 lmpartial Ted
label1 Justmetusandcouldn't giveafuckaboutus Ted
label1 Hell of a night, huh, Ted
label1 Money
label1 Ted, I got a $100 bill here with your name on it,  whether you do what we ask or not
label1 Just to sit back down in that chair for one minute more
label1 I am not gonna cut off Norman's little pinky
label1 But that has nothin' to do with this $100 bill in my hand
label1 ln f act, you can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that goddamn door
label1 But if you wait 60 seconds bef ore you do it,  you're gonna be $100 richer
label1 Ted, you're gonna do whatever you wanna do
label1 All we're askin' is that you indulge us for one minute more
label1 Ted, take the money
label1 Now, let me get this straight
label1 I sit on that stool, listen to what you have to say for 60 seconds,   and I get $100
label1 [Chester] Correct
label1 And afterwards I can walk out that door, no hard f eelings
label1 You got a deal
label1 Yes
label1 Oh, yes, yes
label1 Yes, yes, yes,
label1 Ted, good answer
label1 All right
label1 Norman, give me your watch
label1 Let me know when a minute ends and when it begins
label1 You got it
label1 Ah
label1 Okay
label1 Gentlemen, start your engines
label1 Okay, Ted, pay attention here
label1 I'm gonna make two piles here on the bar
label1 One pile which is yours
label1 And another pile which could be yours
label1 And what you have to realize is we're gonna do this thing...  one way or the other
label1 You can buy a whole lot of soup with that pile
label1 Shh
label1 I'm the closer here
label1 I'm a little me Um, I've lost count
label1 How much is on the bar here
label1 [Group] Six hundred
label1 Ted, do you know how long it takes the average American to count to 600
label1 [Angela] lt's a rhetorical question, Ted
label1 No, sir
label1 About one minute less than it takes to count to 700
label1 Now, Ted, a person's lif e is filled with a zillion little experiences
label1 Some which are insignificant, have no meaning, and, you know, you f orget them
label1 So, since you're gonna be stuck remembering this f or the rest of your lif e,  you have to decide what that memory will be
label1 So, Ted, are you going to remember for the next 40 years,  give or take a decade,  that you refused $1,000 f or one second's worth of work
label1 Or that you made $1,000 f or one second's worth of work
label1 So, Ted, what's it gonna be
label1 Okay
label1 [Group] Yes
label1 Always be closing
label1 Whoo
label1 Right here, right now
label1 Hear, hear
label1 Go
label1 Let's go
label1 Get this shit over and done with
label1 This is one of those moments in time...  none of us are ever gonna f orget
label1 Norman, are you ready
label1 I'm ready
label1 Ted, are you ready
label1 Okeydokey
label1 Norman...  begin
label1 Aaah
label1 My fuckin' finger
label1 He cut off my fuckin' finger
label1 Oh
label1 lt hurts
label1 Nonsense Syllables]  My fuckin' finger, Chester
label1 He cut off my fuckin' finger
label1 Oh, Leo
label1 Call fuckin' Cedars
label1 Wrap it up
label1 Could I talk to Don Levine, please
label1 do this
label1 Why'd you let me do this
label1 he's in surgery
label1 He was supposed to be there
label1 What
label1 Who the fuck has plastic surgery at 6:30 in the morning on New Year's Eve
label1 Nonsense Syllables]   Leo
label1 I need you to stand still
label1 I'll be right back
label1 Hold it
label1 Oh, fuck
label1 Oh, fuck
label1 Oh, fuck
label1 All right
label1 Leo
label1 [Elevator Bell Dings]  I f orgot the finger
label1 l gotta get the  lt's the finger
label1 I got the finger
label1 l got it
label1 right here
label1 Come on, come on
label1 The fuckin' door's closin'
label1 Here
label1 Just put some fuckin' ice in it
label1 All right, let's go
label1 Let's go
label1 Let's go
label1 Get up, get up
label1 I'm gonna go back to my room
label1 Are you comin' or not
label1 No, it's been fun
label1 [Group] Oh
label1 Close the fuckin' door
label1 Nonsense Syllables]  Nonsense Syllables]  Nonsense Syllables]      While I'm very familiar with you and your family,  I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am
label1 Are you aware of my existence
label1 This is good
label1 Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France
label1 Yes
label1 Please tell me what you've heard
label1 I've heard  that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France  who are either hiding or passing for Gentile
label1 But the meaning of your visit,  pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me
label1 The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews  and found nothing
label1 I'm aware of that
label1 But like any enterprise, when under new management,  there is always a slight duplication of efforts,  most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless
label1 I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite
label1 If you can assist me with answers,  my department can close the file on your family
label1 Now,  before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area,  all dairy farmers like yourself
label1 Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts  and the Dreyfuses
label1 Is that correct
label1 Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe
label1 this is your house, make yourself comfortable
label1 Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished
label1 Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape  or someone is very successfully hiding them
label1 What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite
label1 Only rumors
label1 I love rumors
label1 Facts could be so misleading,  where rumors, true or false, are often revealing
label1 Again, this is just a rumor,  but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain
label1 So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape
label1 Yes
label1 Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me  the exact members of the household and their names
label1 The father, Jacob
label1 Wife, Miram
label1 And her brother, Bob
label1 How old is Bob
label1 Continue
label1 And the children,  Amos  and Shosanna
label1 Ages of the children
label1 Amos was nine or 10
label1 And Shosanna
label1 And Shosanna was  18 or 19
label1 Well, I guess that should do it
label1 However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk
label1 But of course
label1 I have no interest in such things
label1 But you are aware of what they call me
label1 What are you aware of
label1 That they call you "The Jew Hunter.
label1 Precisely
label1 I understand your trepidation in repeating it
label1 Heydrich apparently hates the moniker  the good people of Prague have bestowed on him
label1 lt would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it
label1 Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title  precisely because I've earned it
label1 precisely, a German soldier
label1 Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast,  it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk
label1 But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast,  it would be that of the rat
label1 The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing
label1 But where our conclusions differ,  is I don't consider the comparison an insult
label1 Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in
label1 It's a hostile world, indeed
label1 I suppose I would
label1 Rats spread disease
label1 They bite people
label1 Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago
label1 I propose to you any disease a rat could spread,  a squirrel could equally carry
label1 Would you agree
label1 No
label1 Yet, they're both rodents, are they not
label1 And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they
label1 However interesting as the thought may be,  it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel
label1 If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking  would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk
label1 Probably not
label1 I didn't think so
label1 You don't like them
label1 You don't really know why you don't like them
label1 All you know is you find them repulsive
label1 Where does the hawk look
label1 But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide
label1 However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria  and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me
label1 Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of  once they abandon dignity
label1 May I smoke my pipe as well
label1 Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home
label1 Now, my job dictates  that I must have my men enter your home  and conduct a thorough search  before I can officially cross your family's name off my list
label1 And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be
label1 I might add, also, that any information  that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment
label1 Actually, quite the contrary
label1 And that reward will be,  your family will cease to be harassed in any way  by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country
label1 You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not
label1 Yes
label1 You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you
label1 Yes
label1 Point out to me the areas where they're hiding
label1 Since I haven't heard any disturbance,  I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English
label1 I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade
label1 ls that clear
label1 It's the girl
label1 Au revoir, Shosanna
label1 My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine
label1 And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers
label1 Eight Jewish American soldiers
label1 Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon
label1 Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier
label1 We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians
label1 Killing Nazis
label1 I don't know about you all,  but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains,  cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily  and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity
label1 Nazi ain't got no humanity
label1 They're the foot soldiers of a Jewhating, massmurdering maniac  and they need to be destroyed
label1 That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform,  they're going to die
label1 That means I got a little lndian in me
label1 And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance
label1 We will be cruel to the Germans
label1 And they will find the evidence of our cruelty  in the disemboweled, dismembered  and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us
label1 And the German won't be able to help themselves  but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands,  and our boot heels and the edge of our knives
label1 And the German will be sickened by us
label1 And the German will talk about us
label1 And when the German closes their eyes at night  and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done,  it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with
label1 Sound good
label1 ALL: Yes, sir
label1 That's what I like to hear
label1 But I got a word of warning for all you wouldbe warriors
label1 When you join my command, you take on debit
label1 Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps
label1 And I want my scalps
label1 Or you will die trying
label1 Hey, Hirschberg
label1 Send that Kraut sarge over
label1 HIRSCHBERG: You
label1 Go
label1 Sergeant Werner Rachtman
label1 Pleased to meet you
label1 You know what "sit down" means, Werner
label1 Yes
label1 How is your English, Werner
label1 Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate
label1 Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for
label1 Another one up there you might be familiar with
label1 Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz
label1 Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz
label1 MALE NARRATOR: The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity  among German soldiers is simple
label1 As a Germanenlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers
label1 Instead of putting him up against a wall,  the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin  to be made an example of
label1 Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him,  he never got there
label1 Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz
label1 These are the Basterds
label1 Ever heard of us
label1 We just want to say we're a big fan of your work
label1 I think you show great talent
label1 And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent
label1 But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur
label1 Can I assume you know who we are
label1 You're Aldo the Apache
label1 Werner, if you heard of us,  you probably heard we ain't in the prisonertaking business
label1 We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is abooming
label1 HIRSCHBERG: [ LAUGHING ] Oh, yeah
label1 Either kill you or let you go
label1 Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive  depends entirely on you
label1 Up the road a piece, there's an orchard
label1 Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere
label1 If that patrol were to have any crack shots,  that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight
label1 You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me  what kind of artillery they're carrying with them
label1 You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger
label1 Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect
label1 And you need to tell me
label1 And you need to tell me right now
label1 Now, just take that finger of yours  and point out on this here map where this party is being held,  how many is coming and what they brought to play with
label1 I respectfully refuse, sir
label1 Hear that
label1 That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz
label1 You might know him better by his nickname
label1 The Bear Jew
label1 I heard of The Bear Jew
label1 What did you hear
label1 Beats German soldiers with a club
label1 He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does
label1 He's going to take that big bat of his,  and he's going to beat your ass to death with it
label1 Now, take your Wienerschnitzellicking finger,  and point out on this map what I want to know
label1 Fuck you
label1 And your Jew dogs
label1 Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death  is the closest we ever get to going to the movies
label1 Donny
label1 DONNY: Yeah
label1 Oblige him
label1 Did you get that for killing Jews
label1 Bravery
label1 Yeah
label1 BASTERD 1: Oh, no
label1 BASTERD 2: Oh, no
label1 BASTERD: Yeah, Donny
label1 About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you
label1 Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park
label1 He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street
label1 You
label1 Damn it, Hirschberg
label1 Alive
label1 Get the fuck up
label1 Batter up
label1 You're on deck
label1 Two hits
label1 I hit you, you hit the ground
label1 ALDO: Wicki
label1 Ask him if he wants to live
label1 Tell him to point out on this map the German position
label1 Ask him how many Germans
label1 Around about 12
label1 Now, when you report what happened here,  you can't tell them you told us what you told us
label1 They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live
label1 So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks  what's going to happen to every Nazi we find
label1 Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do
label1 WlCKl: He's going to hug his mother
label1 Well, ain't that nice
label1 Ask if he's going to take off his uniform
label1 WICKI: He's going to burn it
label1 We don't like that
label1 See, we like our Nazis in uniforms
label1 That way you can spot them
label1 Just like that
label1 And that don't sit well with us
label1 You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that
label1 You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you
label1 Practice
label1 HANS: Au revoir, Shosanna
label1 MALE NARRATOR: At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable  that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar
label1 Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle
label1 Yes
label1 Then they're flammable
label1 Go on, hop off
label1 MALE NARRATOR: Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper
label1 Shosanna has a collection  of over 350 nitrate film prints
label1 Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir
label1 At ease, Hicox
label1 Drink
label1 If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water
label1 Thataboy, Lieutenant
label1 Make it yourself like a good chap, will you
label1 Something for yourself, sir
label1 Whiskey
label1 Straight
label1 lt says here that you speak German fluently
label1 Like a Katzenjammer Kid
label1 And your occupation before the war
label1 I'm a film critic
label1 List your accomplishments
label1 Well, sir, such as they are,  I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers,  and I've had two books published
label1 Impressive
label1 What are their titles
label1 The first book was called  Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema in the '20s
label1 And the second one was called TwentyFour Frame da Vinci
label1 It's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.W
label1 Pabst
label1 Well...  Down with Hitler
label1 All the way down, sir
label1 Yes
label1 Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich
label1 Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years,  but I'm familiar with it
label1 Pardon, sir
label1 Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry  under the Third Reich
label1 Explain to me UFA under Goebbels
label1 Goebbels considers the films he's making  to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema
label1 How's he doing
label1 Frightfully sorry, sir
label1 Once again
label1 You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game
label1 Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,  how's he doing
label1 Since Goebbels has taken over,  film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years
label1 But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number
label1 Brief him
label1 Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino
label1 Three days from now  Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris
label1 What film, sir
label1 The motion picture is called Nation's Pride
label1 In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion  will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command  including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo,  as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry
label1 Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket
label1 The objective of Operation Kino,  blow up the basket
label1 Jolly good, sir
label1 An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines  will be your assist
label1 The Germans call them the Basterds
label1 The Basterds
label1 Never heard of them
label1 Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them
label1 You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris
label1 The Basterds will be waiting for you
label1 First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine
label1 In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane
label1 There you'll rendezvous with our double agent
label1 She'll take it from there
label1 She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need
label1 How will I know her
label1 I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you
label1 Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark
label1 Bridget von Hammersmark
label1 Yes, for the last two years now
label1 One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild
label1 Indeed
label1 Got the gist
label1 I think so, sir
label1 Paris when it sizzles
label1 l didn't know
label1 lt is a tavern
label1 Yeah, in a basement
label1 You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties
label1 Number one being, you're fighting in a basement
label1 What if we go in there and she's not even there
label1 We wait
label1 Don't worry
label1 She'll make the rendezvous
label1 Stiglitz, right
label1 That's right, sir
label1 l hear you're pretty good with that
label1 Simply making contact with our agent
label1 Should be uneventful
label1 However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful,  I need to know we can all remain calm
label1 Well, now that you put it like that, l guess you do
label1 This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he
label1 ls that the kind of man you need
label1 Loquacious type
label1 So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do
label1 Make bets on how it all comes out
label1 If we get into trouble, we can handle it
label1 But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure  no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement
label1 Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous
label1 She chose the spot
label1 Isn't that just dandy
label1 Look, she's not a military strategist
label1 You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement
label1 She wasn't picking a place to fight
label1 Mmm
label1 HlCOX SPEAKING GERMAN ]               Well, if this is it, old boy,  l hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's
label1 By all means, Captain
label1 There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch
label1 Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily,  l must say, damn good stuff, sir
label1 Now, about this pickle  we find ourselves in
label1 And what would that be
label1 Stiglitz
label1 Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls
label1 You outside
label1 Who are you
label1 American
label1 What
label1 ALDO: We're American
label1 What are you
label1 I'm a German, you idiot
label1 l agree
label1 So let's talk
label1 Okay, talk
label1 My baby was born today
label1 ln Frankfurt
label1 Five hours ago
label1 H is name is Max
label1 We were in here drinking, celebrating
label1 It's not my fault
label1 Okay
label1 lt wasn't your fault
label1 What's your name, soldier
label1 Now, is there anybody alive on our side
label1 No
label1 I'm alive
label1 ls the girl on your side
label1 Which girl
label1 Von Hammersmark
label1 Yeah, she's ours
label1 ls she okay
label1 She's been shot
label1 But she's alive
label1 ALDO: Okay, Wilhelm
label1 What do you say we make us a deal
label1 What's your name
label1 Aldo
label1 You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away
label1 No guns
label1 And we take the girl and leave
label1 It's that simple, Willi
label1 You go your way, we go ours
label1 And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy
label1 We got us a deal
label1 Aldo
label1 I'm here, Willi
label1 l want to trust you
label1 But..
label1 But how can l
label1 Okay, okay
label1 Aldo,  I'm going to trust you
label1 Come down
label1 Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun
label1 l thought we had us a deal
label1 We still have a deal
label1 Not so fast
label1 We only got a deal, we trust each other
label1 And a Mexican standoff ain't trust
label1 You got guns on us
label1 You decide to shoot, we're dead
label1 Up top, they got grenades
label1 They drop them down here, you're dead
label1 No trust, no deal
label1 Fine
label1 Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight
label1 Not so goddamn fast, doc
label1 Tell him to go play with his dogs
label1 Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions
label1 Few questions about what
label1 About I got three men dead back there
label1 Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened
label1 Before we get into who shot John,  why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis
label1 l can see since you didn't see what happened inside,  that the Nazis being there must look odd
label1 Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English
label1 Everybody needs to calm down
label1 You're letting your imagination get the better of you
label1 You met the sergeant yourself
label1 Willi
label1 You remember him, don't you
label1 His wife had a baby tonight
label1 He had just become a..
label1 He had just become a father
label1 The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence
label1 It couldn't be both
label1 The Englishman gave himself away
label1 How'd he do that
label1 He ordered three glasses
label1 We order three glasses
label1 That's the German three
label1 The other looks odd
label1 Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans  and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to
label1 What was the next step
label1 To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms  with all the military there would've been suicide
label1 But going as members of the German film industry,  they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else
label1 I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight
label1 Hand me my purse
label1 Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort
label1 The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant
label1 You still get us in that premiere
label1 You speak German better than your friends
label1 Have I been shot
label1 Yes
label1 I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon
label1 However, there's something you don't know
label1 There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino
label1 One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue
label1 Enormous change at the last minute
label1 That's not very Germatic
label1 Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar
label1 It probably has something to do with the second development
label1 Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere
label1 Fuck a duck
label1 What are you thinking
label1 I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf  makes this horse a different color
label1 lt means you getting us in that premiere
label1 Byebye, acting career
label1 Fun while it lasted
label1 How do you expect me to walk the red carpet
label1 Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam
label1 That's German, ain't it
label1 You all like climbing mountains, don't you
label1 I don't
label1 I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants
label1 But I see your point
label1 We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears  and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet
label1 I know this is a silly question before I ask it,  but can you Americans speak any other language than English
label1 With an atrocious accent, no doubt
label1 But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib
label1 Germans don't have a good ear for ltalian
label1 So you mumble ltalian and brazen through it
label1 That's about it
label1 That sounds good
label1 It sounds like shit
label1 Go home
label1 No, that sounds good
label1 If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building
label1 Who does what
label1 Well, I speak the most ltalian, so I'll be your escort
label1 Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman
label1 He'll be Donny's assistant
label1 Like I said, third best
label1 Just keep your fucking mouth shut
label1 In fact, why don't you start practicing right now
label1 Yes
label1 Gorlomi
label1 Gorlomi
label1 Antonio Margheriti
label1 Dominick Decocco
label1 ANNOUNCING IN GERMAN ]     What's that American expression
label1 "If the shoe fits, you must wear it.
label1 ALDO: Fucking shithead
label1 Faggot fuck
label1 Fuck you
label1 Fuck you, too
label1 Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches
label1 Get your hands off me
label1 You fucking bratwurstsmelling... Goddamn you
label1 Hmm
label1 You Jerrybanging, Limburgsmelling...   As Stanley said to Livingstone,  Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume
label1 Hans Landa
label1 You've had a nice long run, Aldo
label1 My hands to be exact
label1 And they've been waiting a long time to touch you
label1 Caught you flinching
label1 Utivich
label1 Is that you, Lieutenant
label1 Yeah
label1 Do you know what happened to Donny
label1 The woman
label1 No, I do not
label1 Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting,  would you show me mercy
label1 Nope
label1 "Looks like the shoe is on the other foot.
label1 Yeah, I was just thinking that
label1 So you're Aldo the Apache
label1 So you're The Jew Hunter
label1 I'm a detective
label1 A damn good detective
label1 And, yes, some of them were Jews
label1 But Jew Hunter
label1 Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy
label1 Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you
label1 Aldo the Apache and the Little Man
label1 What do you mean the Little Man
label1 The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man
label1 And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life
label1 l mean, you're a little fellow, but not circusmidget little,  as your reputation would suggest
label1 Where's my men
label1 Where's Bridget von Hammersmark
label1 And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark,  you get what you pay for
label1 Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...  How you know our names
label1 Lieutenant Aldo,  if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate  every single one of your swastikamarked survivors,  we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed
label1 Well, back to the whereabouts of your two ltalian saboteurs
label1 As of this moment,  both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in
label1 Doublezero 23 and doublezero 24, if my memory serves
label1 Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode
label1 And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot,  as of this moment, is still a go
label1 What's next
label1 Eliza on lce
label1 However,  all I have to do is pick up this phone right here,  inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput
label1 If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if,  there ain't no way you're going to take them boys  without setting off them bombs
label1 And, yes, some Germans will die
label1 Yes, it will ruin the evening
label1 And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you  for what you've done to his big night
label1 But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels,  you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann
label1 And you need all four to end the war
label1 And if you get all four, you end the war  tonight
label1 So, gentlemen,  let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight
label1 Wouldn't you agree
label1 I guess so
label1 How about you, Utivich
label1 I guess so, too
label1 Gentlemen, l have no intention  of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann,  not to mention winning the war singlehandedly for the Allies,  only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal
label1 If you want to win the war tonight,  we have to make a deal
label1 The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make
label1 However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer
label1 I'm betting for...  OSS would be my guess
label1 That's a bingo
label1 Is that the way you say it
label1 "That's a bingo.
label1 You just say, "Bingo.
label1 Bingo
label1 But I digress
label1 Where were we
label1 Yeah
label1 Make a deal
label1 Get me someone on the other end of that radio  with the power of the pen to authorize my,  let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender
label1 If that tastes better going down
label1 Where is that exactly
label1 Maynardville, Tennessee
label1 I've done my share of bootlegging
label1 Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true,  it ain't
label1 Sitting in your chair, l would probably say the same thing,  and 999
label1 999 times out of a million, you would be correct
label1 But in the pages of history, every once in a while,  fate reaches out and extends its hand
label1 What shall the history books read
label1 MAN: I implore you
label1 We must destroy that tower
label1 Sarge, that tower...  MAN: The tower stands
label1 Psst
label1 HANS: So when the military history of this night is written,  it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino  from the very beginning as a double agent
label1 Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel  was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil  to establish my cover with the Germans
label1 By the way, that last part is actually true
label1 I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank
label1 In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino  to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor
label1 Full citizenship for myself
label1 Well, that goes without saying
label1 Do you have all that, sir
label1 l look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir
label1 Lieutenant Raine
label1 Right here
label1 Yes, sir
label1 GENERAL: Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners
label1 Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines
label1 You will then take over driving of the truck  and bring them straight to me for debriefing
label1 ls that clear, Lieutenant
label1 Over and out
label1 When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard
label1 Can you do it
label1 I have to
label1 Who wants to send a message to Germany
label1 I have a message for Germany
label1 That you are all going to die
label1 And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it
label1 Marcel, burn it down
label1 Oui, Shosanna
label1 My name is Shosanna Dreyfus,  and this is the face  of Jewish vengeance
label1 I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine
label1 We're your prisoners
label1 How about my knife
label1 Thank you very much, Colonel
label1 ls that really necessary
label1 I'm a slave to appearances
label1 Scalp Hermann
label1 Are you mad
label1 I made a deal with your general for that man's life
label1 Yeah, they made that deal
label1 But they don't give a fuck about him
label1 They need you
label1 Nah, I don't think so
label1 I've been chewed out before
label1 You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass
label1 End the war tonight
label1 I'd make that deal
label1 How about you, Utivich
label1 You make that deal
label1 I don't blame you
label1 Damn good deal
label1 And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself
label1 Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command,  l suppose that's worth certain considerations
label1 But I do have one question
label1 Ain't you
label1 Now, that I can't abide
label1 How about you, Utivich, can you abide it
label1 Not one damn bit, sir
label1 l mean, if I had my way,  you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your peckersucking life
label1 I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off
label1 So,  I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off
label1 You know something, Utivich

label1 You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out
label1 That's my motherfucking job
label1 And I don't mind telling you, nigger, it's steady work
label1 Hey, look here, man, I'm still scared as a motherfucker, O.D
label1 They talkin' like they serious as hell...  givin' me time for that machine gun shit
label1 Oh, come on, man
label1 They're just trying to put a fright in your ass
label1 How old is that machine gun shit, huh?
label1 About three years
label1 Three years?
label1 Come on, man, that's a old crime, man
label1 How they gonna find room for you?
label1 That ain't what they're telling me
label1 That's why they call it "fuckin' with you.
label1 Now, let me tell you how we're going to retaliate
label1 All right?
label1 Let me tell you something about my lawyer
label1 This nigger is a junkyard dog
label1 He my own personal Johnny Cochran
label1 Matter of fact, he kicked Johnny Cochran's ass
label1 And like Johnny Cochran, this nigger hate cops
label1 He live to fuck with the police
label1 Now, as a favor, I had him look at your case
label1 He say you ain't got shit to worry about
label1 They just fuckin' with you
label1 So we're gonna sic the junkyard dog on their ass and make 'em stop fuckin' with you
label1 Good lookin' out, man
label1 Good lookin' out
label1 Mmhmm
label1 Come on in, man, and let's celebrate
label1 Uhuh
label1 Look here, I'm really supposed to be somewhere
label1 Matter of fact, I was kind of hoping you could come run with me
label1 What you mean?
label1 What?
label1 What you want?
label1 I need a favor, nigger
label1 That requires me to go out tonight?
label1 Just a bit
label1 It is late as hell, man
label1 I'm home, I'm high, man
label1 Uhhuh
label1 And why are you home, huh?
label1 You home because I spent $10,000 to get your ass home
label1 Now, look, I got a little problem, all right?
label1 I need some help, and you can help me out
label1 Go in the house and throw some shit on
label1 Come on
label1 I'm ready, man
label1 There ain't no problem
label1 It's more like a situation
label1 You remember them three M60 machine guns I sold last year outta the five I got?
label1 Well, I'm gonna sell the other two tonight
label1 There's this group of Koreans over in Korea town startin' this little Neighborhood Watch thing
label1 They need some weapons so they can show the neighborhood niggers they mean business
label1 Now, I'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
label1 The problem is, I ain't never done business with these Koreans before
label1 I ain't worried, 'cause by and large Asians are very dependable
label1 You might argue with them about price and shit,  but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back
label1 But I got me a rule
label1 Never do business with people you ain't never done business with before without backup
label1 Backup
label1 Look, all you've got to do is lay in here and hold on to this motherfucker
label1 All right?
label1 When I open the trunk, you pop up and rack this motherfucker
label1 Man, fuck that shit
label1 I ain't for shootin' nobody
label1 I ain't said nothin' about you shootin' nobody
label1 All you gotta do is hold on to it
label1 They'll get the idea
label1 You must be out of your mind if you think I'm gonna get in this dirtyass trunk
label1 You ain't gonna be in here no more than ten minutes
label1 Why can't I ride up front with you?
label1 You can't ride up front with me
label1 The surprise element is 90% of it
label1 I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gettin' in no goddamn trunk
label1 I can't believe you'd do me like this
label1 I just ain't climbing in no goddamn, dirtyass trunk, man
label1 I got a problem with small places
label1 I got a problem with spending $10,000 on ungrateful niggers to get them out of jail,  but I did it
label1 I know I owe you, you got to bring all this up
label1 Then get your ass in this trunk
label1 I want to help you, but I won't be locked in no goddamn trunk of no car
label1 You think I wanted to spend $10,000 on your ass, huh?
label1 I know you helped me out
label1 Do you think I wanted to spend $10,000 on your ass?
label1 Yes or no?
label1 That's the only way I could help you, right?
label1 So that's what I did
label1 Now, look, man, all I'm asking you to do is get in the trunk,  hold this fuckin' shotgun, point it at these Buddhaheads when I open it, all right?
label1 You're catching a nigger offguard with this shit
label1 Look here
label1 When we get through fucking with these Koreans,  me and you go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles on me
label1 Think about it now
label1 That's some good eatin'
label1 Man
label1 Exactly how long do I gotta be in this motherfucker?

label1 I already caught that show
label1 I got some foryoureyesonly shit to show you
label1 Why don't you step outside?
label1 Who was that?
label1 Who's Beaumont?
label1 A employee I had to let go
label1 He put hisself in a position where he was gonna have to do ten years in prison
label1 That's what he did
label1 And if you know Beaumont,  you know there ain't no goddamn way he can do ten years
label1 If you know that, then you know Beaumont's gonna do anything Beaumont can...  to keep from doin' them ten years,  includin' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing...  about my black ass
label1 Now, that, my friend, is a clearcut case...  of him or me,  and you best believe...  it ain't gonna be me

label1 Miss Brown
label1 Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargas, L.A.P.D
label1 Can I ask what you have in that bag?
label1 The usual stuff
label1 You know, I'm a flight attendant for Cabo Air
label1 Who's this?
label1 Sorry, this is Special Agent Ray Nicollet with Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
label1 Oh, yeah?
label1 May I see some I.D.?
label1 Sure
label1 Would you mind if we just took a look in that bag?
label1 Do I mind?
label1 Do I have a choice?
label1 You have the right to say no
label1 No
label1 I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant
label1 If I don't want to go to all that trouble, I'd just take you in on suspicion now
label1 Suspicion of what?
label1 Uh, could I say something?
label1 Go ahead
label1 Thanks a lot
label1 Bad knees
label1 You have a good flight?
label1 It's a shitty flight down to Cabo
label1 Fuckin' turbulence was unbelievable
label1 Hey, can I look in this envelope?
label1 Ah
label1 Goddamn
label1 I'd say there's about, oh, uh,  $50,000 here
label1 Looks like about 50,000 from here
label1 Is this your money?
label1 You should know if you bring in anything over 1 0,000, you have to declare it
label1 You forget, or what?
label1 You can get a $250,000 fine, plus two years in prison
label1 You want to talk to us about this, or do you want to talk to Customs?
label1 I'm not sayin' another word
label1 Jackie  I hope you don't mind if I call you Jackie
label1 They're a bunch of pricks
label1 Excuse me, but they are
label1 There's something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with
label1 You can go down and talk with those guys...  who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings,  or you can talk with a couple of goodhearted guys like Mark and myself
label1 at the file on Jacqueline Brown
label1 According to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law
label1 In 1985, while a stewardess for Delta,  you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot
label1 That pilot was my husband, and I got off
label1 He did time, you did probation
label1 I didn't hear you ask permission to smoke in my office
label1 May I smoke?
label1 No, you may not
label1 So you get off with a slap on the wrist,  but all this criminal activity fucks up your shit for good with the big airlines
label1 Cut to 1 3 years later, you're 44 years of age,  flying for the shittiest little shuttlefuckin 'piece of shit Mexican airline there is,  where you make what $ 1 3, 000 a year
label1 Didn't exactly set the world on fire, did you, Jackie?
label1 Jackie, you have a good lawyer?
label1 a good one, is more like it
label1 Otherwise you'll be in Sybil Brand three weeks...  before the public defender gets around to ya
label1 Hey, Jackie, do you know a guy named Beaumont Livingston?
label1 Yeah?
label1 No?
label1 Because he knows you
label1 He doesn't know anybody now
label1 He's dead
label1 They found him in a trunk of a car this morning,  shot twice
label1 Once in the chest, once in the head
label1 So I guess I'm wondering
label1 If you don't know Beaumont,  why do you suppose Beaumont knows you?
label1 we don't give a fuck about you
label1 If you cooperate, tell us what we want to know, we'll help you get out of this
label1 If you refuse to cooperate, continue to cop a shit attitude like you're doing now,  we will give you to Customs and they will take you to court
label1 Now, you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change,  but if I was a 44yearold black woman...  desperately clinging on to this one shitty, little job I was fortunate enough to get,  I don't think that I'd think I had a year to throw away
label1 So let's start again now, shall we
label1 Who in Mexico gave you this money, and who in America were you bringing it to
label1 I 'm not sayin' another goddamn word
label1 I 'd like your permission to look through this again so we'll know how much we're talking about
label1 Sure
label1 While we're at it, let's see what else is in there
label1 Do you mind
label1 Beauty case
label1 What's in it
label1 Beauty products
label1 Alarm clock
label1 Glass case
label1 Birth control
label1 My diet shit
label1 Let's see what else is in there
label1 Here
label1 Here
label1 What's this?
label1 What's that shit?
label1 First door on the left
label1 is a long, long, long time ♪  ♪ Ninetynine years is such a long, long, long time ♪  ♪ Ninetynine years is a long, long time ♪  ♪ Well, look at me ♪  ♪ I'll never be free ♪  ♪ I'm a longtime woman ♪♪  Brown, case 7 003 2
label1 The charge is...  possession of narcotics with the intent to distribute
label1 How does your client plead?
label1 Uh, Your Honor, she wishes to stand mute
label1 Detective... Varga
label1 Dargas, Your Honor
label1 Sorry
label1 That's correct, Your Honor
label1 And do you have a bail recommendation
label1 Yes, I do, Your Honor
label1 Based on the defendant's prior conviction...  and the extreme possibility of flight due to the occupation,  the state requests a bond of no less than 25,000
label1 You people are fine with this
label1 I'm gonna set bond at 1 0,000...  and set the date of August 2 1...  for the prelim
label1 Your Honor, when will that be?
label1 That's six weeks from now
label1 We'll continue this matter then
label1 The charge is possession of a concealed weapon...  and striking an officer
label1 How does your client plead
label1 I thought it'd be 2 5.  would like to plead guilty, Your Honor
label1 here in the courtroom
label1 I didn't hear you wash your hands
label1 Comfortable?
label1 Door was open, so I just come on in
label1 I can see that
label1 Why?
label1 Got some more business for you
label1 Oh, yeah?
label1 What did he do?
label1 She is an airline stewardess
label1 Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow
label1 Now, I'm figuring you could take that $1 0,000 you owe me from Beaumont,  move it over to the stewardess
label1 The bond for possession's only a thousand
label1 Hmm
label1 Yeah
label1 They callin' that shit "possession with intent.
label1 A 44yearold black woman caught with less than two ounces,  they calling that shit "intent.
label1 The same thing happen to a movie star, they call it "possession.
label1 Still sounds high
label1 All right, before we start talking about stewardesses,  Let's get Beaumont out of the way first
label1 What?
label1 You ain't hear?
label1 Hear what?
label1 Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out
label1 Oh, shit
label1 Blew Beaumont's brains out
label1 Police make contact with you?
label1 First motherfucking thing they did
label1 You know, they see I pay a big money bond for my boy,  they start thinking that "where there's smoke there's fire" logic
label1 Rousted my ass out of bed 1 0:.00 in the morning
label1 Scared the shit out of my woman Sheronda
label1 She thought they was gonna take my ass away for sure
label1 Mmhmm
label1 Brown
label1 Jackie Brown
label1 What does she do for you?
label1 Who said she do anything for me?
label1 She's my friend
label1 Beaumont worked for you
label1 You can't tell nothing I say to you?
label1 You're not my client till you get busted and I bond you out
label1 Well, we ain't got no, uh What you call that shit?
label1 Confidentiality
label1 Why should I tell you anything?
label1 'Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are
label1 And why would a stewardess be bringing me 50 grand?
label1 Now you want me to speculate on what you do
label1 I'd say you were in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction
label1 Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so, uh, more power to you
label1 All right
label1 You want another bond?
label1 That means paperwork
label1 I gotta get a death certificate, present it to the court,  make out a receipt for return of bond collateral, I type up another application,   Hey, hey, hey, hey
label1 I haven't got time
label1 I'm telling you what I have to do
label1 What you have to do, in case you forgot,   is come up with a premium of a thousand bucks
label1 You know I got the money
label1 I just ain't got it with me
label1 Come back when you do
label1 I'll bond out the stewardess
label1 Look, you got to look at this with a little compassion, all right?
label1 She ain't used to this kind of treatment
label1 Gangsters don't give a fuck, but your average citizen,  a couple of nights in County get to fuckin' with their mind
label1 Ordell, this isn't a bar
label1 You don't have a tab
label1 Listen to me, all right?
label1 She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
label1 Falsely accused of "intent.
label1 If she had that shit and mind you, I'm saying if  that was her own personal shit to get high with
label1 Oh, it's like that, huh?

label1 Yeah
label1 But that's not what this is about

label1 I bet that was that present Mr. Walker was sending Melanie
label1 Yeah
label1 If you didn't put it in there, he must have
label1 Damn
label1 Baby, I'm sorry
label1 Bet they asked you a whole shit load of questions about it, huh?
label1 And all that money, where it came from
label1 Probably asked you who you was bringing' it to too
label1 And you said?
label1 "I want to talk to my lawyer.
label1 You sure you didn't get nervous and kind of let somethin' slip?
label1 I mean, if you did, I ain't mad at you
label1 You ain't asking the right questions
label1 You should be asking why they picked me up
label1 They were waiting for me
label1 They knew about the money and they knew the exact amount
label1 Hmm
label1 I knew it
label1 I knew it
label1 They even asked me if I knew Mr. Walker
label1 Yeah?
label1 I didn't tell them anything about him
label1 Mmmm
label1 You ain't said nothin' about me
label1 Mmmm
label1 Ah, that's mighty noble of you
label1 They tell you what happened to this Beaumont fellow
label1 Yeah, they told me
label1 Somebody must have been real mad at old Beaumont
label1 Yeah, I bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions
label1 And you ain't givin' them no kind of answer
label1 Mmmm
label1 You scared of me
label1 You got any reason to be nervous around me
label1 Is that what I think it is?
label1 I think it's a gun pressed up against my dick
label1 Well, you thought right
label1 Now, take your hands from around my throat,  nigger
label1 Shut the fuck up
label1 Don't you move
label1 Oh, what is this
label1 What the fuck is this
label1 I carry that all the time
label1 You been talking to them police too much
label1 The police didn't try and strangle my ass
label1 I was just playing with you
label1 I ain't playing with you
label1 I'm gonna unload both of these motherfuckers if you don't do what I tell you to do
label1 You understand what I'm saying
label1 Do you understand what the fuck I'm saying
label1 Yeah, woman
label1 Damn
label1 Now, sit your ass down on that sofa
label1 See
label1 Police start fuckin' with your mind, start pittin' black against black
label1 That's how they do
label1 Sit the fuck down
label1 And put your hands behind your head
label1 Oh, silly?
label1 You want to see some motherfuckin' silly
label1 If I have to tell you to shut up one more time, I'm gonna shut you up
label1 I just came over here to talk to you
label1 To talk?
label1 The way I see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about
label1 I can get you a lawyer
label1 No, let's be realistic
label1 Now, sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal,  and you know that
label1 That's why you came here to kill me
label1 I ain't come over to kill you
label1 It's okay
label1 Now, I forgive you
label1 Now, let's say, if I tell on you,  I walk
label1 If I don't, I'll go to jail
label1 I want $100,000...  in an escrow account in my name...  if I'm convicted up to a year or put on probation
label1 Now, if I have to do more than a year,  you pay another $100,000
label1 I can do that
label1 You know I got that problem
label1 Well, I been thinking about that too
label1 I got me an idea
label1 Uh  Let me hear that
label1 We friends again
label1 Why don't you point that motherfucking gun somewhere else
label1 I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on
label1 All right
label1 Come in and I'll get it for you
label1 Max, look, I am so sorry about this
label1 You know, I was afraid to ask to borrow it, 'cause I was afraid you would say no
label1 I mean, you'd have to
label1 Would you like some coffee
label1 I am
label1 Come on in
label1 Why don't you make yourself at home
label1 Did you get a chance to use it?
label1 I felt a lot safer having it
label1 Oh, the milk went bad while I was in jail
label1 Cool
label1 Would you, uh, care to hang on to it for a while
label1 It wouldn't be legal, but if it makes you feel better, I guess  Well, thanks
label1 I got one now
label1 You went out this morning and bought a gun
label1 What
label1 You went out this morning and bought a gun
label1 Well, let's say I got one now, okay
label1 Somebody loan it to you

label1 Are you
label1 I don't know
label1 I'm gonna go in and talk with Nicolet and Dargas today
label1 I'm going to do what you suggested offer to help and see what happens
label1 What I meant was to have a lawyer do the negotiating for you
label1 I know more now about Ordell's money
label1 Well, if it's the A.T.F
label1 guy that wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point
label1 I know, but it's a lot of money
label1 It's a half a million dollars all in Cabo, and more coming in
label1 Ordell told me last night
label1 He called?
label1 He came by
label1 What'd you do
label1 We talked
label1 He had his doubts at first, but he's always trusted me
label1 And he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can
label1 Because he needs my ass
label1 Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit over there in Cabo
label1 You want some sugar
label1 No, thank you
label1 Maybe, but I'm the only one he's ever used
label1 I mean, he can't use his other people
label1 They're crooks
label1 I mean, he might try to... bring the money in himself,  but he ain't gonna wanna stand in no customs lines
label1 So, either he recruits another Cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me
label1 And I made him feel like he still can
label1 Yeah, if I get off
label1 Otherwise, fuck 'em
label1 Do you realize that

label1 You're not old
label1 You look great

label1 It's not really something I think about
label1 Really
label1 I guess I got sensitive about my hair a few years ago
label1 It started falling out, so I did something about it
label1 I feel fine with it
label1 Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it
label1 I did it to feel better about myself, and, you know, I do
label1 I look in the mirror
label1 Looks like me

label1 And so, coughing's good
label1 You definitely know a lot about that
label1 Look here, Louis, I got to run out for a little while

label1 This one
label1 Oh
label1 Um, 14
label1 Yup
label1 Shit, man
label1 Well, I'm about the same height now as I was then
label1 Bruno
label1 Sanchez
label1 That other picture, that green one
label1 Yeah?
label1 Do you remember that
label1 It was in Hollywood
label1 Were you in L.A. then
label1 No
label1 Where were you
label1 With Ordell
label1 Yeah
label1 Oh
label1 Were you a... disco guy?
label1 Nah
label1 Come on
label1 No, I wasn't
label1 I don't like to dance
label1 Were you ever in one
label1 I went to a few just to meet women, but...  it was so loud and I didn't like to dance
label1 During that whole scene, I just drank in bars usually
label1 So who didn't make the cut
label1 That's a picture of me in Japan
label1 Uh, that's the guy that I lived with
label1 His name was HiHiro Hiro Hiroshi
label1 If you count cheese
label1 I never got to know him really
label1 You know, I couldn't speak any Japanese, and his English was terrible
label1 But what am I going to say
label1 His English was better than my Japanese, you know
label1 Not really
label1 You know, we didn't have that much to say to each other anyway
label1 That's Japan
label1 Oh
label1 Yeah
label1 Wanna fuck
label1 Yeah
label1 That was fun

label1 I bet you come in here on a Saturday night,  you need nigger repellant to keep them motherfuckers off your ass
label1 Oh, I do okay
label1 Bullshit, Jackie
label1 You're a fine motherfucker
label1 You think anybody followed you
label1 I don't think so
label1 But it don't matter, 'cause they already know I'm meeting you
label1 I told them
label1 You told  3.25
label1 Here
label1 Thank you, sir
label1 You told 'em it's me
label1 They already know it's you
label1 Goddamn, that don't mean you got to confirm it
label1 Look, the only way they're going to give me permission to fly...  is if I agree to help 'em, which is what I have to appear to be doing
label1 So I might as well give them somebody they already knowyou
label1 Goddamn You told them all that
label1 It's true, ain't it
label1 What the fuck that got to do with anything
label1 They know I'm delivering for you
label1 I told 'em about the half mil
label1 They could give a fuck about it
label1 All they wanna do is catch your ass with guns
label1 Let me bring in the money.
label1 And they said
label1 Hey, what's the matter
label1 I mean, that's what we discussed last night
label1 This is just seeming kind of risky now, you know
label1 Fuck this
label1 I make two deliveries the first with 10,000
label1 You know, like a dry run
label1 They watch it, see how it works
label1 Then the second delivery, I come home with the half mil
label1 See, that's too much exposure
label1 Now, I ain't goin' nowhere near that money
label1 You don't have to
label1 I told them you never pick up the money yourself
label1 You always send someone, and I never know who it is
label1 Mm
label1 That's a good idea
label1 Now, the first time I do it, they're looking around,  they see me hand the 10,000 to someone
label1 I don't know
label1 A friend of yours
label1 Like a woman
label1 If you want
label1 Yeah
label1 Wait a minute
label1 If they're gonna let you go,   how come we don't bring all the cash in the first time
label1 Now, the next trip, when I bring in the half mils,  it's gonna look like I'm doing the same thing as I did before
label1 But you don't?
label1 No
label1 I hand it to someone else first
label1 Hmm
label1 And they follow the wrong one,  thinking she's bringing the money to me
label1 That's the idea
label1 Can you cover that?
label1 Yeah
label1 Yeah, I got the women covered
label1 Where are you planning on puling this off?
label1 And I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
label1 It's my plan
label1 We're in this together
label1 Yeah, but it's my money and I don't need no fuckin' partners
label1 I ain't your partner
label1 And I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands,  and I'm managing to do it all under the nose of the cops
label1 So, therefore, I'm your manager, and a manager gets 1 5%
label1 No, a manager gets ten percent
label1 I'm gonna give you ten
label1 No
label1 No
label1 I'm getting 1 5%, all right?
label1 All I'm gonna give you is ten
label1 And the same deal as before
label1 I can do that
label1 See, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit
label1 He's acting like he's this big international arms dealer...  when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers
label1 Well, he seems to be making out
label1 Is it dead?
label1 Yeah
label1 Yeah, well... so far, he is
label1 Oh..
label1 I wouldn't go so far as to say that
label1 What does that tell you?
label1 Let's say that he's streetwise, you know
label1 We'll give him that
label1 He's still a fuckup
label1 He killed a man who worked for him the other day
label1 That I should get out of here?
label1 You know where he went?
label1 He went to go meet that stewardess
label1 Does that bother you?
label1 Please
label1 Well, I don't know
label1 He just drops in and out
label1 Did he tell you about that half million he's got down in Mexico?
label1 Uhhuh
label1 Of course he did
label1 He tells anybody who’s gonna listen
label1 They're scheming on how they can get that money over here
label1 And your point is?
label1 Let him and the stewardess get the money over here,  Uhhuh
label1 and then just take it from them
label1 just tried to stare me down ♪   Can I ask you a question?
label1 Oh, man
label1 It's just about Melanie
label1 You know what?
label1 I'm really sorry about that, man,  but I had to be somewhere all of a sudden
label1 I figured, well, shit, Louis ain't had no pussy for a while
label1 So I thought, let him kick it here with Mel
label1 ♪ The things that you do ♪  So, what she say?
label1 She didn't have to say shit
label1 I know Melanie
label1 Melanie really good about throwing a fuck a nigger's way
label1 I mean, she ain't no damn good at it, but she likes to fuck
label1 Is that what you thought?
label1 No, I wasn't sure
label1 I didn't know
label1 But you fucked her anyway?
label1 Oh
label1 Well, I hope you felt appropriately guilty afterwards
label1 Afterwards, I did
label1 you know, what is she to you?
label1 You know, she's just one of the bitches I got set up
label1 I got Mel over in Hermosa Beach,  and I rent this little place for Simone over in Compton where you’re staying,  and about four blocks away I got this young 1 9yearold country girl named Sheronda
label1 I found her on the bus stop two days out of Georgia,  barefoot, country as a chicken coop
label1 Took her to my place in Compton, told her it was Hollywood
label1 She believed you?
label1 To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood
label1 Closest she ever been, anyway
label1 But you trust Melanie around your business?
label1 She trying to play your ass against me, ain't she?
label1 Yeah
label1 Uhhuh
label1 See, I knew it
label1 I knew it
label1 See, you didn't have to say nothing
label1 I know that bitch
label1 I don't understand why you keep someone around your business and you can't even trust 'em
label1 I ain't gotta trust her
label1 I don't know what that means, man
label1 Well, I don't understand why you keep her the fuck around
label1 I told you, man
label1 She's my fine little surfer girl

label1 So, what are you up to?
label1 What'd you see?
label1 What the fuck is up with this shit?
label1 I called you last night
label1 I got your message
label1 Ray wanted to have dinner with me so we can, you know, talk about the sting we're plotting
label1 That's what he calls it, a sting
label1 He's been He's been really nice
label1 Maybe
label1 But I'm thinking it's something more like he wants the money for himself
label1 No
label1 He just tries to act cool
label1 You know, I don't think there's anything wrong with that
label1 He's just a young guy having fun being a cop
label1 I know the type
label1 Trust me on this
label1 If he does anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction,  but he wouldn't walk off with the money:, it's evidence
label1 And what about you, Max?
label1 What?
label1 If I was in Nicolet's place?
label1 No, I mean you right now, not if you were somebody else
label1 If I saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
label1 It's not like it's somebody's life savings
label1 It wouldn't even be missed
label1 You're avoiding the question, Max
label1 Okay, sure, I guess I'd be tempted,  especially now since I'm getting out of the bail bond business
label1 Why?
label1 A lot of reasons
label1 I guess the main one would be, uh..
label1 When did you decide?
label1 It's been a long time coming,  but I finally made up my mind
label1 I guess it was... Thursday
label1 Yes?
label1 I'm Max Cherry, your bail bondsman
label1 Yeah
label1 I went to pick up this guy
label1 I hear he's staying at a house, and, uh..
label1 I sneak in and I'm waiting for him  Wait a minute
label1 After we were together, you snuck into a guy's house
label1 I went back to my office and found out that you took my gun,  got another gun and the stun gun,  went to this guy's house in Ell Monte and waited for him to come home
label1 What do you do when he comes home?
label1 Shoot him with the stun gun
label1 While he's incapacitated, you cuff him and take him to County
label1 You do that?
label1 It's my job
label1 Well, the guy never came home
label1 But I'm sitting on his couch in the dark holding my stun gun
label1 The whole house smells of cat pee
label1 And after a couple of hours, I think,  "What am I doing this?
label1 And I make up my mind
label1 That's it
label1 I'm not sure you answered my question, Max
label1 Which one?

label1 He was at Ordell’s apartment in Hermosa Beach
label1 Yeah
label1 I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out
label1 Not really
label1 His full name's Louis Gara
label1 Just did four years up in Susanville
label1 For what?
label1 Bank robbery
label1 We've been following him
label1 They did two years together about, I don't know,  20 years ago or so over at Huntsville
label1 He's not living over in Hermosa Beach, though
label1 Living with some 56yearold petty thief, some woman named, uh...  Hawkins, Simone Hawkins
label1 Hmm
label1 You know her
label1 No
label1 They ever talk about her?
label1 Not yet
label1 Okay, who's the other one?
label1 What's her deal?
label1 Oh, yeah?

label1 She's not a part of it,  and she's pissed off that she's not a part of it
label1 Well, this is definitely somebody I wanna meet
label1 Okay, are we all set up for tomorrow
label1 Everything okay
label1 I told him Ordell’s changing the amount he's bringing in
label1 Think they bought it?
label1 Mm, oh, yeah
label1 I got 'em thinking that Ordell’s real nervous,  and they love thinking that he's scared of' em
label1 All he needed was a reasonable explanation
label1 Everything's the same, except for one change
label1 What's that?
label1 So he's sweating a little bit
label1 He's gonna keep his half mil where it is,  but he's gonna bring in 50,000 just in case he needs bail
label1 It'll be more than that
label1 Don't be so literal
label1 Ray believed it
label1 You still have to show him the money at the airport
label1 I'm not gonna show him the whole amount
label1 And where's the rest of it?
label1 In the bag, underneath
label1 What if he checks
label1 He won't
label1 You're taking a hell of a chance, kid
label1 Not really
label1 If he finds it, I'll say Mr. Walker put it in there...  and I didn't know anything about it, like the coke
label1 Well, then you're out
label1 Yeah, but I'm not in jail...  and at least I tried
label1 You're going to have surveillance all over you

label1 Well, she wasn't here today 'cause she done split on my ass
label1 Me and Louis went by her pad
label1 She gone
label1 She gone, her shit's gone and my 10,000 motherfucking dollars is gone
label1 Don't start buggin' on me
label1 Everything's just like we discussed
label1 Now, except for this time when we make the split,  instead of Simone it's gonna be Melanie
label1 I think someone's knocking on the door
label1 Goddamn it, Melanie got just as much sense as that bitch has, she'd be in the same place
label1 All right

label1 What?
label1 Mmhmm
label1 If I did, I'd have to give one to you, wouldn't I?
label1 Of course, nobody knows how much there is
label1 I guess we could take as much as we want
label1 Isn't that right?
label1 Yes
label1 All those things are true
label1 I mean, it's not like the money belongs to anybody

label1 I'd like to believe you're aware enough, even now,  to know that there's nothing sadistic in my actions
label1 Well, maybe towards those other jokers
label1 But not you
label1 No, kiddo
label1 At this moment..
label1 Bill, it's your baby

label1 Sarah, I cannot believe you are early
label1 What you got
label1 I got your ass
label1 Remember that
label1 Huh
label1 Remember
label1 Come on, bitch
label1 Come on
label1 Bring it on
label1 Hey, baby
label1 How was school
label1 Oh
label1 That goodfornothing dog of yours got his ass  in the living room and acted a damn fool
label1 That's what happened, baby
label1 Barney did this
label1 Baby, now, you can't come in here
label1 There's broken glass everywhere, and you could cut yourself
label1 Hi, honey
label1 I'm  What's your name
label1 Her name is Nikki
label1 Nikki
label1 Such a pretty name for such a pretty girl
label1 Nikki, asked you a question
label1 I'm 4
label1 4 years old, eh
label1 She'd be about 4 now
label1 Now, baby, me and Mommy's friend got some grownup talk  to talk about
label1 You can go in your room now
label1 Okay
label1 Nikkia
label1 In your room
label1 Now
label1 You want some coffee
label1 Yeah
label1 Sure
label1 Her husband is Dr. Lawrence Bell
label1 But back when we were acquainted, four years ago,  her name was Vernita Green
label1 Her code name was Copperhead
label1 Do you have a towel
label1 Yeah
label1 Thanks
label1 You still take cream and sugar
label1 Yeah
label1 You suppose correctly
label1 You can relax for now
label1 I'm not gonna murder you in front of your child, okay
label1 That's being more rational  than Bill led me to believe you were capable of
label1 It's mercy, compassion and forgiveness I lack
label1 Look
label1 I know I fucked you over
label1 I fucked you over bad
label1 I wish to God I hadn't, but I did
label1 You have every right to want to get even
label1 No, no, no, no, no
label1 No
label1 That'd be even, Vernita
label1 That'd be about square
label1 Look, if I could go back in a machine, I would
label1 But I can't
label1 Oh, great
label1 I don't care
label1 Be that as it may,  I know I don't deserve your mercy or your forgiveness
label1 However, I beseech you for both on behalf of my daughter
label1 You and I have unfinished business
label1 And not a goddamn fucking thing you've done  in the subsequent four years,  including getting knocked up, is gonna change that
label1 So when do we do this
label1 It all depends
label1 When do you wanna die
label1 The day after tomorrow
label1 How about tonight, bitch
label1 Splendid
label1 Where
label1 There's a baseball diamond where I coach little league  about a mile from here
label1 We meet there around 2:30 in the morning,  dressed all in black, your hair in a black stocking
label1 We won't be bothered
label1 Now, I have to fix Nikki's cereal
label1 Bill said you were one of the best ladies he saw  with an edged weapon
label1 I know he didn't qualify that shit
label1 So you can just kiss my motherfucking ass, Black Mamba
label1 Black Mamba
label1 I should have been motherfucking Black Mamba
label1 If you wanna stick with your butcher knife, that's fine
label1 Very funny, bitch
label1 Very funny
label1 For that, I'm sorry
label1 But you can take my word for it
label1 Your mother had it coming
label1 When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it..
label1 I'll be waiting
label1 For those regarded as warriors..
label1 Suppress all human emotion and compassion...  ...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be Lord God, or Buddha himself
label1 This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat
label1 Come on out to Dallas
label1 This is Rockabilly Rhythms on KTRN, Wichita Falls
label1 Very own wild man, Charlie Feathers
label1 It's a goddamn massacre, Pop
label1 They wiped out the whole wedding party, execution style
label1 Give me a figure
label1 Nine dead bodies
label1 Bride
label1 Groom
label1 Reverend
label1 Reverend's wife
label1 They even shot that old colored fella that plays the organ
label1 Good gravy, Marie
label1 What'd I tell you, Pop
label1 It's like a goddamn Nicaraguan death squad
label1 You're in a house of worship
label1 Sorry, Pop
label1 Well, this is definitely the work of professionals
label1 I'd guesstimate Mexican Mafia hit squad
label1 Four, maybe five strong
label1 Well, a sure and steady hand did this
label1 This ain't no squirrelly amateur
label1 This is the work of a salty dog
label1 You can tell by the cleanliness of the carnage
label1 Now, a killcrazy rampage, though it may be,  all the colors are kept inside the lines
label1 If you was a moron, you could almost admire it
label1 Don't know
label1 That's a fake
label1 We've been calling her "The Bride"  on account of the dress
label1 You can tell she was pregnant
label1 Man would have to be a mad dog  to shoot a goddamn goodlooking gal like that in the head
label1 Look at her
label1 Haycolored hair
label1 Big eyes
label1 Son Number One
label1 This tall drink of cocksucker ain't dead
label1 I might never have liked you
label1 Point in fact, I despise you
label1 But that shouldn't suggest that I don't respect you
label1 My gift to you
label1 For fuck's sake
label1 Hello, Bill
label1 What's her condition
label1 Comatose
label1 Where is she
label1 I'm standing over her right now
label1 That's my girl
label1 What
label1 We owe her better than that
label1 Oh, you don't owe her shit
label1 You don't owe her shit
label1 May I say one thing
label1 Speak
label1 Y'all beat the hell out of that woman
label1 And I put a bullet in her head
label1 But her heart just kept on beating
label1 Now, you saw that yourself  with your own beautiful blue eye, did you not
label1 And if she ever wakes up, we'll do a whole lot more
label1 But one thing we won't do  is sneak into her room in the night like a filthy rat  and kill her in her sleep
label1 And the reason we won't do that thing  is because that thing would lower us
label1 I guess
label1 Do you really have to guess
label1 No
label1 I don't really have to guess
label1 I know
label1 Come on home, honey
label1 Affirmative
label1 I love you, too
label1 Thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you
label1 Word of advice, shithead
label1 Don't you ever wake up
label1 Bill, it's your baby
label1 Oh, my baby
label1 Four years
label1 Four years
label1 The price is $75 a fuck, my friend
label1 You getting your freak on or what
label1 Oh, yeah, boy
label1 20, 40, 60, 75
label1 Now here's the rules
label1 Rule number one
label1 No punching her
label1 Nurse comes in and she got a shiner  or less some teeth, jig's up
label1 And by the way, this cunt's a spitter
label1 It's a motorreflex thing
label1 Now, are clear on rule one
label1 Yeah
label1 Good
label1 Now, rule number two
label1 In fact, no leaving no marks of no kind
label1 After that, it's all good, buddy
label1 Now, her plumbing down there don't work
label1 So feel free to come in her all you want
label1 Keep the noise down
label1 Try not to make a mess
label1 Oh, shit
label1 By the way, not all the time, but sometimes  this chick's cooch can get drier than a bucket of sand
label1 If she dry, lube up with this and you'll be good to go
label1 Bon appetit, good buddy
label1 Oh, yeah
label1 Oh, God damn
label1 You are the bestlooking girl I've had today
label1 Time's up, buddy
label1 Hey buddy, did you have yourself a good time
label1 Where's Bill
label1 Where's Bill
label1 Please stop hitting me
label1 I don't know who Bill is
label1 Bullshit
label1 Well, ain't you the slice of cutie pie they said you was
label1 Jane Doe, huh
label1 We don't know shit about you, do we
label1 I'm from Huntsville, Texas
label1 My name is Buck, and I'm here to fuck
label1 Your name is Buck
label1 And you came here to fuck
label1 Right
label1 Wait a minute
label1 Wait
label1 You fucker
label1 Texas
label1 Wiggle your big toe
label1 Wiggle your big toe
label1 Wiggle your big toe
label1 Wiggle your big toe
label1 As I lay in the back of Buck's truck,  trying to will my limbs out of entropy...  Wiggle your big toe
label1 ...I could see the faces of the cunts who did this to me
label1 And the dicks responsible
label1 When fortune smiles on something  as violent and ugly as revenge,  it seems proof like no other that not only does God exist,  you're doing his will
label1 At a time when I knew the least about my enemies,  the first name on my death list,  ORen Ishii, was the easiest to find
label1 But when one manages the difficult task  of becoming queen of the Tokio underworld,  one doesn't keep it a secret, does one
label1 The halfJapanese, halfChinese American Army brat  made her first acquaintance with death at the age of 9
label1 It was at that age she witnessed  the death of her parents at the hands  of Japan's most ruthless yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto
label1 Mommy
label1 She swore revenge
label1 Luckily for her, Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile
label1 At 11, she got her revenge
label1 Look at me, Matsumoto...  ...take a good look at my face
label1 Look at my eyes
label1 Do I look familiar
label1 By 20, she was one of the top female assassins in the world
label1 At 25, she did her part in the killing  of nine innocent people, including my unborn daughter,  in a small wedding chapel in El Paso, Texas
label1 But on that day four years ago she made one big mistake
label1 She should have killed 10
label1 However, before satisfaction would be mine,  first things first
label1 Hard part's over
label1 Now, let's get these other piggies wiggling
label1 Welcome to Air O
label1 May I help you
label1 Okinawa
label1 Oneway
label1 Welcome..
label1 Welcome
label1 Almost
label1 American
label1 American
label1 Welcome, American
label1 Domo
label1 You said "domo.
label1 Can you speak Japanese
label1 You said "domo.
label1 No, no
label1 Just a few words I learned since yesterday
label1 Um, may I sit at the bar
label1 Oh, sure, sure, sure
label1 Please, sit
label1 What other words did you learn
label1 We have a customer
label1 Bring out some tea, quickly
label1 Lazy bastard...  Screw your soap opera..
label1 Hurry up
label1 Why don't you serve it yourself for once
label1 Shut up
label1 Get your ass out here
label1 Uh, excuse me
label1 Oh, let's see
label1 Um, "arigato.
label1 "Arigato.
label1 Good
label1 Yeah
label1 Yeah, yeah, yeah
label1 "Konnitchiwa.
label1 "Kohnneecheewah.
label1 Konnichi wa
label1 Please repeat
label1 Konnichi wa
label1 Perfect
label1 You say Japanese word like you Japanese
label1 Oh, you're making fun of me
label1 Serious business
label1 Pronunciation very good
label1 You say arigato like we say arigato
label1 Well, thank you
label1 You should learn Japanese
label1 Very easy
label1 No kidding
label1 Most difficult
label1 But you have Japanese tongue
label1 Okay, okay
label1 Oh
label1 Oh, my God
label1 Hurry up... goddammit
label1 Lazy oaf...  What d'ya want
label1 I beg your pardon
label1 Oh, yes
label1 A bottle of warm sake, please
label1 Warm sake
label1 One warm sake
label1 Sake
label1 In the middle of the day
label1 Day, night, afternoon  Who gives a damn Get the sake
label1 How come I always have to get the sake
label1 You listen well...  For thirty years, you make the fish, I get the sake
label1 If this were the military,  I'd be General by now
label1 Oh, so you'd be General, huh
label1 Do you understand
label1 I'm not bald, okay
label1 I shaved my head
label1 Do you understand me
label1 Oh
label1 First time in Japan
label1 Uhhuh
label1 Oh
label1 What brings you to Okinawa
label1 Oh, yeah
label1 You have a friend live in Okinawa
label1 Not quite
label1 Not friend
label1 I never met him
label1 Who is he
label1 May I ask
label1 Hattori Hanzo
label1 What do you want with Hattori Hanzo
label1 I need Japanese steel
label1 Why do you need Japanese steel
label1 You must have big rats, you need Hattori Hanzo's steel
label1 Huge
label1 You may
label1 Wait
label1 Try the second one down
label1 You like samurai swords
label1 I like baseball
label1 I wanted to show you these
label1 However...  ...someone as you, who knows so much, must surely know..
label1 ...I no longer make instruments of death
label1 ...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value
label1 Yet proud as I am of my life's work..
label1 ...I have retired
label1 Then give me one of these
label1 I didn't say "sell me.
label1 I said "give me.
label1 Because my vermin is a former student of yours
label1 And considering the student,  I'd say you have a rather large obligation
label1 You can sleep here
label1 It will take me a month...  ...to make the sword
label1 I suggest you spend it practicing
label1 I've completed doing...  ...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,  ...to never do again
label1 And in that purpose, I was a success
label1 I've done this because philosophically,  I am sympathetic to your aim
label1 I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword
label1 If on your journey, you should encounter God...  ...God will be cut
label1 Yellowhaired warrior...  Go
label1 Domo
label1 When the final sword was sheathed,  it was ORen Ishii and her powerful posse...  ...the Crazy 88, that proved the victor
label1 The pretty lady to ORen's right,  who's dressed like she's a villain on "Star Trek,"  is ORen's lawyer, best friend, and second lieutenant
label1 Another former protegee of Bill's
label1 The young girl in the schoolgirl uniform  is ORen's personal bodyguard, 17yearold Gogo Yubari
label1 Do you like Ferraris
label1 Ferrari... ltalian trash
label1 Do you want to screw me
label1 Don't laugh
label1 Do you want to screw me, yes or no
label1 Yes
label1 Do you still wish to penetrate me...  ...or is it I...  ...or is it I... who has penetrated you
label1 See what I mean
label1 The bald guy in the black suit and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,  the head general of ORen's personal army, the Crazy 88
label1 And just in case you were wondering  how could a halfbreed JapaneseChinese American  become the boss of all bosses in Tokio, Japan,  I'll tell you
label1 The night ORen assumed power over the crime council
label1 The man who seems bound and determined  to break the mood is Boss Tanaka
label1 And what Boss Tanaka thinks is...  Boss Tanaka
label1 This is a time for celebration
label1 And what exactly are we celebrating
label1 The perversion of our illustrious council
label1 Tanaka, have you gone mad
label1 You're disrespecting our sister
label1 Apologize
label1 TanakaSan, of what perversion do you speak
label1 My father...  ...along with yours,  and along with yours, started this council
label1 Shut up
label1 ...over the perversion committed today
label1 Outrageous
label1 Tanaka, it is you who insults this council
label1 Bastard
label1 Fuck face
label1 Gentlemen
label1 By all means, allow him to express it
label1 I speak, of the perversion done to this council,  ...which I love...  ...more than my own children,  ...by making a Chinese JapAmerican half breed bitch its leader
label1 ...I'm going to say this in English
label1 As your leader..
label1 If you're unconvinced  a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest,  tell me so
label1 But allow me to convince you
label1 And I promise you, right here and now,  no subject will ever be taboo
label1 Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion
label1 The price you pay  for bringing up either my Chinese or American heritage  as a negative is, I collect your fucking head
label1 Just like this fucker here
label1 I didn't think so
label1 Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned
label1 Moshi moshi
label1 Hey
label1 Hey, yeah
label1 Hey, yeah
label1 Gogo
label1 They demand ridiculous things
label1 Shut up... Do you know what would happen if they heard you
label1 What's gonna happen
label1 Did you hear about the Tanaka clan
label1 You're gonna get your head chopped off
label1 No, I don't want that
label1 Yes, it's me
label1 Who do you remind me of
label1 You're right, he does look like Charlie Brown
label1 Charlie Brown
label1 Four pepperoni pizzas
label1 That's not on our menu..
label1 I don't care, bring them, goddammit
label1 Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss
label1 ORen Ishii
label1 Charlie Brown, beat it
label1 Miki
label1 So, ORen, any more subordinates for me to kill
label1 Hi
label1 Gogo, right
label1 Bingo
label1 And you're Black Mamba
label1 Don't they
label1 Gogo, I know you feel you must protect your mistress
label1 But I beg you
label1 You call that begging
label1 You can beg better than that
label1 Is that what I think it is
label1 You know, for a second there, yeah, I kind of did
label1 Silly rabbit
label1 Trix are for..
label1 Kids
label1 #  # Ain't nobody doin' but me, baby #  # Nobody but me #  # Well, let me tell you nobody #  # Nobody but me #  # Well, let me tell you nobody #  # Nobody #  This is what you get for fucking around with yakuzas
label1 Go home to your mother
label1 Those of you lucky enough to still have your lives...  ...take them with you
label1 However...  ...leave the limbs you've lost
label1 Except you, Sofie
label1 You stay right where you are
label1 Your instrument is quite impressive
label1 Where was it made
label1 Okinawa
label1 Whom in Okinawa made you this steel
label1 This is Hattori Hanzo steel
label1 Swords however, never get tired
label1 I hope you've saved your energy
label1 But as last looks go,  you could do worse
label1 Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords
label1 You may not be able to fight like a samurai
label1 But you can at least die like a samurai
label1 Attack me...  ...with everything you have
label1 ...I apologize
label1 Accepted
label1 Ready
label1 That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword
label1 Sofie
label1 Sofie
label1 I'm so sorry
label1 Please
label1 Please forgive my betrayal
label1 But still..
label1 But still nothing
label1 Except my aching heart over what she's done  to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie
label1 I've kept you alive for two reasons
label1 The first reason is information
label1 Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde
label1 Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde
label1 I'll tell you nothing
label1 And every time you don't give me answers,  I'm gonna cut something off
label1 And I promise you, they will be things you will miss
label1 I want all the information on the Deadly Vipers
label1 If you had to guess...  What they've been doing
label1 Why she left you alive...  And where I can find them
label1 What would be your guess
label1 She informed me
label1 She said I could keep my wicked life for two reasons
label1 As I said before,  I've allowed you to keep your wicked life for two reasons
label1 And the second reason is so you can tell him, in person,  everything that happened here tonight
label1 I want him to witness the extent of my mercy  by witnessing your deformed body
label1 I want him to know what I know
label1 I want him to know I want him to know
label1 Revenge is never a straight line
label1 It's a forest
label1 And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...  ...to get lost... to forget where you came in
label1 That woman deserves her revenge
label1 And we deserve to die
label1 How did you find me
label1 I'm the man
label1 One more thing, Sofie
label1 Is she aware her daughter is still alive
label1 Master..
label1 Your Mandarin is lousy
label1 You bray like an ass
label1 You are not to speak unless spoken to
label1 I speak Japanese very well..
label1 I didn't ask if you speak Japanese..
label1 I asked if you understand Cantonese
label1 A little
label1 If you can't understand me..
label1 I will communicate with you like l would a dog
label1 When l yell, when l point, when l beat you with my stick
label1 Yes, he is
label1 Your master tells me... you're not entirely unschooled
label1 What training do you possess
label1 I am proficient in TigerCrane Style,  And l am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the Samurai sword
label1 The exquisite art of the Samurai sword
label1 Don't make me laugh
label1 Your socalled exquisite art, is only fit for...  Japanese fat heads
label1 No
label1 Are you aware l kill at will
label1 Yes
label1 Is it your wish to die
label1 No
label1 Then you must be stupid...  Then you must be stupid... so stupid
label1 Rise, and let me look at your ridiculous face
label1 Rise
label1 What's the matter
label1 Cat got your tongue
label1 Oh yes, you speak Japanese
label1 Go to that rack
label1 Remove the sword
label1 Let's see how good you really are
label1 From here you can get an excellent view of my foot
label1 Your swordsmanship... is amateur at best
label1 I asked you to demonstrate... what you know... and you did...  Not a goddamn thing
label1 Let's see your Tiger Crane... match my Eagle's Claw
label1 Like all Yankee women...  ... all you can do is order in restaurants and spend a man's money
label1 Excruciating... isn't it
label1 Yes
label1 If it was my wish...  ... l could chop your arm off
label1 No, please don't
label1 It's my arm now
label1 I can't
label1 Because you're helpless
label1 Yes
label1 Have you ever felt this before
label1 No
label1 Compared to me... you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle
label1 YES!!
label1 THAT'S THE BEGlNNlNG
label1 Yes
label1 Your training will begin... tomorrow
label1 Since your arm now belongs to me...  ... l want it strong
label1 I can, but not that close
label1 Then you can't do it
label1 What if your enemy... is three inches in front of you...  ... What do you do then...  ... Curl into a ball...  ... or do you put your FlST through him
label1 It's the wood that should fear your hand...   not the other way around
label1 No wonder you can't do it... you acquiesce to defeat...   before you even begin
label1 If you want to eat like a dog...  You can live and sleep outside like a dog
label1 Come on, you bitch
label1 OK, Pai Mei
label1 Here l come
label1 Elle, you treacherous dog
label1 It's too risky
label1 I'm through doing that shit
label1 You always say that
label1 The same thing every time
label1 "I'm through, never again, too dangerous.
label1 I know that's what I always say
label1 I'm always right too
label1 The days of me forgetting are over
label1 The days of me remembering have just begun
label1 You know, when you go on like this, what you sound like
label1 You sound like a duck
label1 Quack, quack, quack
label1 Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again
label1 Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack
label1 After tonight
label1 Can I get anyone more coffee
label1 Oh, yes
label1 Thank you
label1 You're welcome
label1 I mean, the way it is now, you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank
label1 Takin' more of a risk
label1 Banks are easier
label1 They're insured
label1 Why should they give a fuck
label1 I don't even need a gun in a federal bank
label1 Heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone
label1 He gives the phone to a teller
label1 If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill her.
label1 Fuckin' right it worked
label1 That's what I'm talkin' about
label1 Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone...  not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone
label1 They don't lift a fuckin' finger
label1 Did they hurt the little girl
label1 There probably never was a little girl
label1 The point of the story isn't a little girl
label1 The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone
label1 You want to rob banks
label1 I'm not saying I wanna rob banks
label1 I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we've been doing
label1 What've we been talkin' about
label1 Yeah, no more liquor stores
label1 Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be
label1 There's too many foreigners own liquor stores
label1 You tell 'em empty out the register, they don't know what you're talkin' about
label1 They make it too personal
label1 We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him
label1 I'm not gonna kill anybody
label1 But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them
label1 And if it's not the gooks...  it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations
label1 Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone
label1 See how far that gets you
label1 Forget it
label1 We're out of it
label1 Well, what then, day jobs
label1 Not in this life
label1 <i>Garcon, coffee!</i>  This place
label1 Garcon means boy
label1 This place
label1 A coffee shop
label1 Nobody ever robs restaurants
label1 Why not
label1 Bars, liquor stores...  gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them
label1 Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down
label1 Not as expectin' anyway
label1 I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this
label1 Correct
label1 Same as banks, these places are insured
label1 He don't give a fuck
label1 They're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin' the diners
label1 Waitresses
label1 No way they're takin' a bullet for the register
label1 Some wetback gettin' paid $1 .50 an hour...  really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner
label1 Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on
label1 One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet...  the next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face
label1 See, I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up, remember
label1 All the customers kept comin' in
label1 Yeah
label1 Now, that was a good idea
label1 Thank you
label1 Made more from the wallets than we did from the register
label1 Yes, we did
label1 A lot of wallets
label1 Pretty smart, huh
label1 Pretty smart
label1 I'm ready
label1 Right now, right here
label1 Come on
label1 Same as last time, remember
label1 You're crowd control
label1 I'll handle the employees
label1 I love you, pumpkin
label1 I love you, honey bunny
label1 This is a robbery
label1 Any of you fucking pricks move...  and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you
label1 <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get down with the boogie.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get it on.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get down with the boogie.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get it on.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get up with the boogie.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get up with the get down.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get down and boogie.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Shake it around.</i>   Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars
label1 Okay, what you want to know
label1 Hash is legal there, right
label1 Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal
label1 I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places
label1 Those are hash bars
label1 It breaks down like this
label1 It's legal to buy it
label1 It's legal to own it
label1 And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it
label1 It's illegal to carry it, but that doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this
label1 I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have
label1 Oh, man
label1 I'm goin'
label1 That's all there is to it
label1 I'm fuckin' goin'
label1 I know, baby
label1 But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is
label1 What
label1 I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here...   but it's just there, it's a little different
label1 Example
label1 You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer
label1 And I don't mean just like no paper cup
label1 I'm talkin' about a glass of beer
label1 And in Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonald's
label1 They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese
label1 They got the metric system
label1 They wouldn't know what the fuck a quarterpounder is
label1 They call it a Royale with Cheese
label1 Royale with Cheese
label1 What do they call a Big Mac
label1 Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac
label1 Le Big Mac
label1 I don't know
label1 I didn't go into Burger King
label1 You know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup
label1 What
label1 Mayonnaise
label1 Goddamn
label1 I seen 'em do it, man
label1 They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit
label1 We should have shotguns for this kind of deal
label1 How many up there
label1 That's countin' our guy
label1 Not sure
label1 So that means that it could be up to five guys up there
label1 It's possible
label1 What's her name
label1 Mia
label1 Mia
label1 How did Marsellus and her meet
label1 I don't know
label1 She used to be a actress
label1 She do anything I'd have seen
label1 I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot
label1 Pilot
label1 What's a pilot
label1 Well, you know the shows on TV
label1 I don't watch TV
label1 Yeah, but you are aware that there is an invention called television...  and on this invention they show shows, right
label1 The way they pick TV shows is they make one show
label1 That show's called a pilot
label1 Some get chosen and become television programs
label1 Some don't, become nothin'
label1 She starred in one of the ones that became nothing
label1 You remember Antwan Rockamora
label1 Halfblack, halfSamoan
label1 Yeah, maybe
label1 Fat, right
label1 I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat
label1 He got a weight problem
label1 He's Samoan
label1 I think I know who you mean
label1 Marsellus fucked him up good
label1 Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife
label1 So what he'd do
label1 Fuck her
label1 No, no, no, no, no
label1 Well, then what then
label1 He gave her a foot massage
label1 A foot massage
label1 That's it
label1 Then what'd Marsellus do
label1 They took him out on his patio
label1 Threw his ass over the balcony
label1 Nigger fell four stories
label1 He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse
label1 Nigger fell through that
label1 That's a damn shame
label1 But still, you play with matches, you get burned
label1 What do you mean
label1 You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage
label1 You don't think he overreacted
label1 A foot massage is nothin'
label1 I give my mother a foot massage
label1 It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife
label1 I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out
label1 No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark
label1 Eatin' the bitch out and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing
label1 It's not
label1 It's the same ballpark
label1 Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither
label1 Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine
label1 But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies...  ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport
label1 Have you ever given a foot massage
label1 I'm the foot fuckin' master
label1 You given a lot of them
label1 Shit, yeah
label1 Got my technique down and everything
label1 I don't be ticklin' or nothin'
label1 Would you give a guy a foot massage
label1 Fuck you
label1 You give 'em a lot
label1 You know, I'm kind of tired
label1 I could use a foot massage
label1 Yo, yo, yo, man
label1 You best back off
label1 Yeah, it is
label1 What time you got
label1 7:22 in the a.m.  No, it ain't quite time yet
label1 Come on
label1 Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right...  for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin' house...  fuckin' up the way the nigger talks; that shit ain't right
label1 Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker
label1 I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothin'
label1 I'm sayin' it does
label1 Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages, and they all meant somethin'
label1 We act like they don't, but they do
label1 That's what's so fuckin' cool about them
label1 There's a sensuous thing goin' on...  where you don't talk about it, but you know it and she knows it
label1 And Antwan should've fuckin' better known better
label1 That's his fuckin' wife, man
label1 You know what I'm sayin'
label1 It's an interestin' point
label1 Come on
label1 Let's get into character
label1 Mia
label1 Mia
label1 Why you so interested in big man's wife
label1 He's goin' out of town, Florida
label1 And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone
label1 Take care of her
label1 Just take her out
label1 Make sure she don't get lonely
label1 You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date
label1 It is not a date
label1 It's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'
label1 It's not a date
label1 It's definitely not a date
label1 Hey, kids
label1 How you boys doin'
label1 Hey, keep chillin'
label1 You know who we are
label1 We're associates of your business partner, Marsellus Wallace
label1 Now, let me take a wild guess here
label1 You're Brett, right
label1 Yeah
label1 You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett
label1 Yeah, I remember
label1 Good
label1 Looks like me and Vincent caught you boys at breakfast
label1 Sorry about that
label1 Hamburgers
label1 The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast
label1 What kind of hamburgers
label1 Cheeseburgers
label1 No, no, no
label1 Where'd you get 'em
label1 Where
label1 Big Kahuna Burger
label1 Big Kahuna Burger
label1 That's that Hawaiian burger joint
label1 I ain't never had one myself
label1 How are they
label1 They're good
label1 You mind if I try one of yours
label1 This is yours here, right
label1 Yeah
label1 Vincent
label1 You ever had a Big Kahuna burger
label1 Want a bite
label1 I ain't hungry
label1 Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime
label1 Me, I can't usually get 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian...  which pretty much makes me a vegetarian
label1 But I do love the taste of a good burger
label1 You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France
label1 Tell 'em, Vincent
label1 A Royale with Cheese
label1 A Royale with Cheese
label1 Because of the metric system
label1 Check out the big brain on Brett
label1 That's right
label1 The metric system
label1 What's in this
label1 Sprite
label1 Good
label1 You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with
label1 Go right ahead
label1 That hit the spot
label1 You
label1 Flock of Seagulls
label1 You know why we're here
label1 It's over..
label1 I don't remember askin' you a goddamned thing
label1 You were sayin'
label1 It's in the cupboard
label1 We happy
label1 Vincent
label1 We happy
label1 Yeah, we happy
label1 I didn't get your name
label1 I got yours
label1 Vincent
label1 Right
label1 No, no, no
label1 I just want you to know how..
label1 I just want you to know how sorry we are that things got so fucked up...  with us and Mr. Wallace
label1 We got into this thing with the best intentions
label1 Really
label1 I never  Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration
label1 I didn't mean to do that
label1 Please
label1 What's the matter
label1 Oh, you were finished
label1 Oh, well, allow me to retort
label1 What does Marsellus Wallace look like
label1 What
label1 What country you from
label1 "What" ain't no country I ever heard of
label1 They speak English in What
label1 What
label1 English, Motherfucker
label1 Do you speak it
label1 Then you know what I'm sayin'
label1 Yes
label1 Describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like
label1 I  Say ' "what" again
label1 Say "what" again
label1 I dare ya
label1 Say ""what" one more goddamn time
label1 He's black
label1 Go on
label1 He's bald
label1 Does he look like a bitch
label1 Does he look... like a bitch
label1 No
label1 Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch, Brett
label1 I didn't
label1 Yes, you did
label1 Yes, you did, Brett
label1 No, no
label1 But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace
label1 Yes
label1 Well, there's this passage I got memorized
label1 Sort of fits this occasion
label1 Ezekiel 25:17
label1 "The path of the righteous man..."  is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish...  and the tyranny of evil men
label1 And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...  those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
label1 And you will know my name is the Lord...  "when I lay my vengeance upon thee!
label1 I think you gonna find, when all this shit is over and done..
label1 The thing is, Butch...  right now... you got ability
label1 But painful as it may be, ability... don't last
label1 And your days are just about over
label1 Now, that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life
label1 But that's a fact of life your ass is gonna have to get realistic about
label1 Motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine
label1 If you mean it turns to Vinegar... it does
label1 If you mean it gets better with age... it don't
label1 Two
label1 Boxers don't have an oldtimers' day
label1 You came close, but you never made it
label1 And if you were gonna make it, you would have made it before now
label1 You my nigger
label1 The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting
label1 That's pride fuckin' with you
label1 Pride only hurts
label1 It never helps
label1 You fight through that shit
label1 'Cause a year from now, when you kickin' it in the Caribbean...  you gonna say to yourself, "Marsellus Wallace was right.
label1 I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace
label1 In the fifth, your ass goes down
label1 In the fifth, my ass goes down
label1 Yo, Vincent Vega
label1 Our man in Amsterdam
label1 Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood
label1 Get your asses on in here

label1 Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right
label1 It's the big man's wife

label1 Asshole

label1 What's up
label1 Man, I'm really sorry
label1 Pack of Red Apples
label1 $1 .40
label1 And some matches
label1 It's as if it turns every part of your body into the tip of a penis
label1 I'll lend it to you
label1 It's a great book on piercing
label1 That gun to pierce your ears, they don't use that to pierce your nipples, do they
label1 Forget that gun
label1 All my piercing, 18 places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle
label1 Excuse me
label1 I was just curious...  but... why would you wear a stud in your tongue
label1 Sex thing
label1 Helps fellatio
label1 Vincenzo
label1 This is Panda from Mexico
label1 Very good stuff
label1 Now, that's Bava
label1 And that is Choco from the Harz Mountains of Germany
label1 Now, the first two are the same
label1 300 a gram
label1 Those are friend prices
label1 But this one is a little more expensive
label1 This is 500 a gram
label1 But, when you shoot it, you will know where that extra money went
label1 This is real, real, real good shit
label1 But this one is a fuckin' madman
label1 Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam
label1 Are we in Inglewood
label1 No
label1 You're in my home
label1 Now, white people who know the difference...  between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to
label1 Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...   any old day of the fuckin' week
label1 This ain't Amsterdam, Vince
label1 This is a seller's market
label1 Coke is fuckin' dead as... dead
label1 All right
label1 Gimme three grams of madman
label1 Now, if it's as good as you say it is, I'll come back and buy another thousand
label1 I just hope that I still have some left for ya...  but I'm givin' you some out of my own private stash
label1 That is what a nice guy I am
label1 I'm outta balloons
label1 Is a baggie all right
label1 All right
label1 I'll just get one for ya
label1 Honey, will you get me some baggies and twistix from the kitchen
label1 Okay
label1 Hey, what do you think about Trudi
label1 She ain't got a boyfriend
label1 Which one's Trudi
label1 The one with all the shit in her face
label1 That's my wife
label1 I'm sorry, man
label1 Thank you
label1 No, I can't
label1 I gotta be someplace
label1 All right, no problemo  I'll take a rain check
label1 Still got your Malibu
label1 Oh, man, you know what some fucker did the other day
label1 Fuckin' keyed it
label1 Oh, man, that's fucked up
label1 Tell me about it
label1 I had it in storage for three years
label1 It was out five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucked with it
label1 No trial, no jury, straight to execution
label1 I wish I could've caught him doin' it
label1 I'd have given anything to catch that asshole
label1 It'd been worth him doin' it just so I could've caught him
label1 What's more chickenshit than fuckin' with a man's automobile
label1 Don't fuck with another man's Vehicle
label1 You don't do it
label1 It's just against the rules
label1 Thank you
label1 Mind if I shoot up here

label1 <i>Lay me down in lonesome town.</i>  <i> I can learn to forget</i>  So...  Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam
label1 Sure did
label1 How long were you there
label1 Just over three years
label1 No kiddin'
label1 I didn't know that
label1 I heard you did a pilot
label1 That was my 15 minutes
label1 What was it
label1 What
label1 <i> Fox Force Five.</i>  Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks
label1 Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with
label1 And five, as in there's onetwothreefourfive of us
label1 She was the leader
label1 The Japanese fox was a Kung Fu master
label1 The black girl was a demolition expert
label1 French Fox's specialty was sex
label1 What was your specialty
label1 The character I played, Raven McCoy...  her background was she grew up raised by circus performers
label1 According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife
label1 And she knew a zillion old jokes
label1 And if we would have got picked up, they would've worked in a gimmick...  where every show I would've told another joke
label1 You know any of them old jokes
label1 Well, I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show
label1 Tell me
label1 It's corny
label1 Don't be that way
label1 No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed
label1 You'd be embarrYou told 50 million people, and you can't tell me
label1 I promise I won't laugh
label1 That's not what I meant
label1 You know it
label1 Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much
label1 What a gyp
label1 Martin and Lewis
label1 Yummy
label1 You think I could have a sip of that
label1 Be my guest
label1 I gotta know what a fivedollar shake tastes like
label1 You can use my straw
label1 I don't have cooties
label1 All right
label1 Goddamn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake
label1 Told ya
label1 I don't know if it was worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good
label1 Don't you hate that
label1 Hate what
label1 Uncomfortable silences
label1 I don't know
label1 That's a good question
label1 That's when you know you found somebody really special
label1 When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence
label1 We just met each other
label1 I'll tell you what
label1 You sit here... and think of something to say
label1 I'll do that
label1 Okay
label1 I said goddamn
label1 Goddamn
label1 I need some hair spray
label1 Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom...  to find your food waiting for you
label1 I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter
label1 Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section
label1 Which one
label1 There's two Monroes
label1 No, there's not
label1 That is Marilyn Monroe
label1 That is Mamie Van Doren
label1 Pretty smart
label1 Yeah
label1 I got my moments
label1 So did you think of somethin' to say
label1 Actually, I did
label1 I don't want to offend you
label1 This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring, gettin'toknowyou chitchat
label1 Well, well, I do
label1 I do
label1 But you have to promise not to be offended
label1 You can't promise somethin' like that
label1 I have no idea what you're gonna ask me
label1 You can ask me what you're gonna ask me...  and my natural response could be to get offended
label1 Let's just forget it
label1 That's an impossibility
label1 Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility
label1 Is that a fact
label1 And besides...  isn't it more exciting when you don't have permission
label1 Well, here goes
label1 What did you think about what happened to Antwan
label1 Who's Antwan
label1 Tony Rocky Horror
label1 He fell out of a window
label1 Well, that is one way to say it
label1 Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out
label1 Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus
label1 Is that a fact
label1 No
label1 No, it's not a fact
label1 It's just what I heard
label1 That's just what I heard
label1 Who told you
label1 They
label1 They certainly do
label1 They certainly do
label1 Don't be shy, Vincent
label1 What else did ""they" say
label1 Did it involve the ' "F" word
label1 No, no, no, no, no
label1 And
label1 And nothin'
label1 That's it
label1 You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourthstory window...  for giving me a foot massage
label1 Well, at the time I was told it sounded reasonable
label1 Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourthstory window...  for massaging my feet seemed reasonable
label1 No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen
label1 I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you

label1 All right, tell me what to do
label1 Okay, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart
label1 But she's got a breastplate you gotta pierce through that
label1 You gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion
label1 I gotta stab her three times
label1 But it's gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart
label1 Once you do that, you press down on the plunger
label1 Okay

label1 Am I gonna kill her
label1 It's  All right, count to three

label1 He funny, silly dog.</i>  <i>He think totem pole alive!</i>  <i>He Arctic tenderfoot!</i>  <i>That totem pole been here forever!</i>  Butch
label1 <i>One more thing, and we'll start for</i>   Butch, stop watching TV for a second
label1 Yeah
label1 <i> Stand up
label1 Stand up.</i>  Now, do you remember when I told you your daddy died in a POW camp
label1 Well, this here is Captain Koons
label1 He was in the POW camp with Daddy
label1 Hello, little man
label1 Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you
label1 We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together, over five years
label1 Hopefully...  you'll never have to experience this yourself...  but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were...  for as long as we were...  you take on certain responsibilities of the other
label1 If it'd been me who'd...  not made it, Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim
label1 But the way it turned out, I'm talking to you
label1 This watch I got here...  was first purchased by your greatgrandfather during the First World War
label1 It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee
label1 Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches
label1 Up 'til then, people just carried pocket watches
label1 It was bought by private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...  on the day he set sail for Paris
label1 This was your greatgrandfather's war watch...  and he wore it every day he was in that war, and...  when he'd done his duty, he went home to your greatgrandmother...  took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed...  until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country...  to go overseas and fight the Germans once again
label1 This time they called it World War II
label1 Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's
label1 Dane was a Marine, and he was killed...  along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island
label1 He knew it
label1 None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive...  so three days before the Japanese took the island...  your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Winocki...  a man he'd never met before in his life...  to deliver to his infant son...  who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch
label1 Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word
label1 After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother...  delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch
label1 This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi
label1 He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp
label1 He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch...  it'd be confiscated, taken away
label1 The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright
label1 He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright...  so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide somethinghis ass
label1 Then he died of dysentery He give me the watch
label1 I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years
label1 Then...  after seven years, I was sent home to my family and...  now...  little man, I give the watch to you
label1 It's time, Butch
label1 <i>In the lightweight division...</i>  <i>in the right corner</i> <i>wearing the blue trunks...</i>  <i>weighing 210 pounds...</i>  <i>Floyd Ray Wilson!</i>  <i>It's official
label1 Marsellus
label1 No, it wasn't
label1 I didn't do it
label1 I didn't do it
label1 How you doing
label1 I never thanked you for dinner
label1 What you got
label1 He booked
label1 His trainer
label1 I believe him
label1 No, we don't wanna think
label1 We wanna know
label1 Take him to the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass
label1 We'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't
label1 Butch's searchhow do you want it done
label1 I'm prepared to scour the Earth for that motherfucker
label1 If Butch goes to Indochina, I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...   ready to pop a cap in his ass
label1 Mister
label1 Hey, mister
label1 What
label1 You were in that fight, the fight on the radio
label1 No, come on
label1 You're him
label1 I know you're him
label1 Tell me you're him
label1 I'm him
label1 He's dead
label1 The radio said he was dead
label1 Sorry about that, Floyd
label1 What does it feel like
label1 What does what feel like
label1 Killing a man
label1 Beating another man to death with your bare hands
label1 No
label1 You are the first person I have ever met who has killed somebody
label1 So
label1 What does it feel like to kill a man
label1 I'll tell you what
label1 Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there and I'll tell you all about it
label1 So, Esmarelda...  Villa Lobosis that Mexican
label1 That's some handle you got there, honey
label1 Thank you
label1 Butch
label1 What does it mean
label1 I'm an American, honey
label1 So, moving right along, Esmarelda...  what is it you want to know
label1 I want to know what it feels like to kill a man
label1 I couldn't tell ya
label1 I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead
label1 I don't feel the least bit bad about it
label1 What the fuck'd I tell ya
label1 As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man, the odds went through the roof
label1 I know
label1 I know
label1 Hey, fuck him, Scotty
label1 If he was a better boxer, he'd still be alive
label1 If he never laced up his gloves...  which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive
label1 Yeah, well, who gives a fuck
label1 It's over now
label1 Yeah, well, enough about the poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd
label1 Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch
label1 How long to collect
label1 So you'll have it all by tomorrow night
label1 No, I understand
label1 A few stragglers aside
label1 Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news
label1 Yeah
label1 No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning
label1 It'll probably take us a couple days to get down to Knoxville
label1 Okay, my brother
label1 You're right
label1 You're goddamn right
label1 Cool, brother
label1 $45.60
label1 And... here's a little something for the effort
label1 The truth
label1 Three welldressed, slightly toasted Mexicans
label1 Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos
label1 <i>Buenas noches, Butch.</i>  Whew
label1 Keep the light off
label1 <i> Oui.</i>  Hard day at the office
label1 Pretty hard
label1 Got in a fight
label1 Poor baby
label1 You know what
label1 I was thinkin' about takin' a shower
label1 I'm stinkin' like a dog over here
label1 I like the way you stink
label1 I was looking at myself in the mirror
label1 Uhhuh
label1 I wish I had a pot
label1 A pot
label1 A pot belly
label1 Well, you should be happy...  'cause you have one
label1 Shut up, fatso
label1 I don't have a pot
label1 I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did "'Lucky Star.
label1 I didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy
label1 The difference is huge
label1 Would you like it if I had a pot belly
label1 No
label1 Pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla
label1 The rest of you is normalnormal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass...  but with a big, perfectly round pot belly
label1 If I had one, I'd wear a Tshirt two sizes too small to accentuate it
label1 You think men would find that attractive
label1 I don't give a damn what men find attractive
label1 It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye...  is seldom the same
label1 You'd punch me in the belly
label1 Right in the belly
label1 Ohh
label1 I'd smother you
label1 I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe
label1 You'd do that
label1 Promise
label1 Did you get everything
label1 Yes, I did
label1 Good job, sugar pop
label1 Did everything go as planned
label1 You didn't listen to theOw
label1 You didn't listen to the radio
label1 I never listen to your fights
label1 I won, all right
label1 Are you still retiring
label1 Sure am
label1 We're not at the finish yet, baby
label1 We're in a lot of danger, aren't we
label1 If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they
label1 Do you still want me to go with you
label1 I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance
label1 It's  Say it
label1 Fabienne, I want you to be with me
label1 Forever
label1 Do you love me
label1 Very, very much

label1 And I took it back
label1 Butch
label1 Yes, lemon pie
label1 Well, I'm not sure yet
label1 Wherever you want
label1 We're gonna get a lot of money from this...  but it ain't gonna be the kind of money...  that we can live like hogs in the fat house forever
label1 I was thinking maybe we could go down someplace in the South Pacific
label1 Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna carry us a long way down there
label1 You betcha

label1 Come on
label1 Baby, please, we
label1 Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road
label1 Get on
label1 Oh, baby, I'm sorry
label1 I'm so sorry
label1 You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts
label1 I didn't mean to worry you
label1 Everything's fine
label1 How was your breakfast
label1 Did you get the blueberry pancakes
label1 They didn't have blueberry; I had to get buttermilk
label1 Are you sure you're okay
label1 Since I left you, this has been, without a doubt...  the single weirdest fuckin' day of my lifeI'll tell you all about it
label1 Gotta go
label1 Butch, whose motorcycle is this
label1 It's a chopper, baby
label1 Zed's
label1 Who's Zed
label1 Zed's dead, baby
label1 Zed's dead
label1 Yes, you did, Brett
label1 You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked...  by anybody except Mrs. Wallace
label1 Oh, God, please, I don't wanna die
label1 You read the Bible, Brett
label1 Well, there's this passage I got memorized
label1 Sorta fits the occasion
label1 Ezekiel 25:17
label1 "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides..."  by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
label1 And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...  those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
label1 I'm fucked
label1 Oh, fuck
label1 Oh, fuck
label1 Oh, goddamn
label1 Goddamn
label1 Vincent, Marvin
label1 Marvin, Vincent
label1 Better tell him to shut up
label1 He's gettin' on my nerves
label1 Marvin
label1 Marvin
label1 I'd knock that shit off if I was you
label1 Die, you motherfuckers
label1 Die
label1 Slip your mind
label1 Did you forget that someone was in there...  with a goddamn hand cannon
label1 You see the size of that gun he fired at us
label1 It was bigger than him
label1 I know
label1 We was lucky
label1 No, no, no, no
label1 That shit wasn't luck
label1 This was divine intervention
label1 You know what divine intervention is
label1 I think so
label1 That means that God came down from heaven and stopped the bullets
label1 That's right
label1 God came down from heaven and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets
label1 I think it's time for us to leave, Jules
label1 Don't fuckin' blow this shit off
label1 What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle
label1 Chill
label1 Wrong
label1 Wrong
label1 This shit doesn't just happen
label1 Do you want to continue this theological discussion in a car...  or in a jailhouse with the cops
label1 What happened here was a miracle, and I want you to fucking acknowledge it
label1 All right, it was a miracle
label1 Can we go now
label1 Let's go, nigger
label1 Come on
label1 Shit
label1 You ever seen that show Cops
label1 He just unloaded on this guy and nothin' happened
label1 He didn't hit nothin'
label1 Okay
label1 I mean, you know, it's freaky, but it happens
label1 You wanna play blind man, go walk with the shepherd...  but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open
label1 What the fuck does that mean
label1 It means that's it for me
label1 Jesus Christ
label1 Goddamn it
label1 Don't blaspheme
label1 I said, don't do that
label1 Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us
label1 Why don't you tell him at the same time why
label1 Don't worry, I will
label1 And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off
label1 I don't give a damn if he does
label1 You gotta have an opinion
label1 You think God came down from heaven and stopped
label1 What the fuck's happenin'
label1 Shit, man
label1 Man
label1 Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face
label1 I didn't mean it
label1 It was an accident
label1 It was an accident
label1 We probably went over a bump or somethin'
label1 The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump
label1 I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch
label1 The gun went off
label1 Look at this fuckin' mess
label1 I don't believe it
label1 Well, believe it now, motherfucker
label1 We gotta get this car off the road
label1 Just take it to a friendly place, that's all
label1 This is the Valley, Vincent
label1 Marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the Valley
label1 Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man
label1 Shit
label1 What you doing
label1 I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake
label1 Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios
label1 Jimmie, how you doin', man
label1 It's Jules
label1 Just listen up, man
label1 Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we gotta get it off the road, pronto
label1 I need to use your garage for a couple hours
label1 We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie situation
label1 He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door
label1 We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls...  but I don't want it to reach that pitch Jimmie's a friend
label1 You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what
label1 Just tell him not to be abusive
label1 Put yourself in his position It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up
label1 He wasn't expectin' this shit
label1 We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor
label1 If that favor means I gotta take shit, he can stick that favor straight up his ass
label1 Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man
label1 You're supposed to wash 'em first
label1 I watched you get 'em wet
label1 I was washin' 'em
label1 This shit's hard to get off
label1 Maybe if he'd had Lava I coulda done a better job
label1 I used the same fuckin' soap you did...  and when I finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxipad
label1 What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this
label1 It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head, man
label1 You know I respect you and all
label1 But just don't put me in this position, all right
label1 Fine
label1 Fine
label1 Ask me nice like that, no problem
label1 Go ahead
label1 I don't care
label1 Goddamn, Jimmie
label1 This some serious gourmet shit
label1 Me and Vincent would've been satisfied with some freezedried Taster's Choice
label1 Right
label1 What flavor is this
label1 Knock it off, Julie
label1 I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is
label1 I'm the one who buys it
label1 I know how good it is
label1 When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit
label1 But you know what's on my mind right now
label1 It ain't the coffee in my kitchen
label1 It's the dead nigger in my garage
label1 I wanna ask you a question
label1 When you came pulling in here...  did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, "'Dead nigger storage"
label1 You know I ain't seen no
label1 Did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, "Dead nigger storage"
label1 I didn't
label1 You know why you didn't see that sign
label1 Why
label1 'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why
label1 We're not gonna store the motherfucker  Don't you fuckin' realize...  that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced
label1 No trial separation
label1 I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced
label1 Okay
label1 And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced
label1 Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you, but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it
label1 Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules
label1 Okay
label1 Don't fuckin' '"Jimmie" me
label1 There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife
label1 Is there
label1 The graveyard shift at the hospital
label1 You gotta make some phone calls
label1 You gotta call some people
label1 Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here
label1 That's Kool and the Gang
label1 All I wanna do is call my people and get 'em to bring us in
label1 You're fucking my shit up right now
label1 You're gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home
label1 Do me that favor, all right
label1 I suggest you get going
label1 What do you think she'll do
label1 Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak
label1 That ain't no kinda answer
label1 I mean, you know, I don't
label1 How much
label1 A lot or a little
label1 You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is
label1 All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs
label1 All I want to hear from your ass is...  "You ain't got no problem, Jules, I'm on the motherfucker
label1 Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly.
label1 You ain't got no problem, Jules
label1 Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly
label1 You sendin' the Wolf
label1 Oh, you feel better, motherfucker
label1 Shit, negro
label1 That's all you had to say
label1 When is she due
label1 Give me the principals' names again
label1 Place your bets
label1 Cards, please
label1 Vincent
label1 Jimmie
label1 Bonnie
label1 It's 30 minutes away
label1 I'll be there in 10
label1 This is your house
label1 It sure is
label1 I'm Winston Wolf
label1 I solve problems
label1 Good
label1 So I heard
label1 May I come in
label1 Yeah
label1 You must be Jules
label1 Which would make you... Vincent
label1 Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen
label1 Is that right, Jimmie
label1 One hundred percent
label1 Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., correct
label1 I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much
label1 She wouldn't at that
label1 That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge...  which, if you do what I say, when I say it, should be plenty
label1 Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage
label1 Jimmie
label1 Uhhuh
label1 Do me a favor, will ya
label1 Thought I smelled some coffee back there
label1 Would you make me a cup
label1 Yeah, sure
label1 Oh, how do you take it
label1 Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar
label1 Does it smoke
label1 Does it make a lot of noise
label1 Is there gas in it
label1 Aside from how it looks, the car's cool
label1 Don't get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work
label1 As far as I know, the motherfucker's tiptop
label1 Good enough
label1 Let's go back to the kitchen
label1 Here you go, Mr. Wolf
label1 Thank you, Jimmie
label1 Okay, first thing
label1 Take the body, stick it in the trunk
label1 That would lead me to believe you got cleansers and shit
label1 Yeah
label1 Under the sink
label1 Good
label1 What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products...  and clean the inside of the carI'm talkin' fast, fast, fast
label1 Go in the back seat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull
label1 Get it out of there
label1 It don't need to be spickandspan
label1 You don't need to eat off it
label1 Just give it a good onceover
label1 What you need to take care of are the really messy parts
label1 The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up
label1 The thicker the better, the darker the better
label1 No whites
label1 Can't use 'em
label1 We'll need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards...  with quilts and blankets...  so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last...  but at a glance the car will appear to be normal
label1 Jimmie, lead the way
label1 Boys, get to work
label1 Please would be nice
label1 Come again
label1 I'm not here to say please
label1 I'm here to tell you what to do
label1 And if selfpreservation is an instinct you possess...  you'd better fuckin' do it and do it quick
label1 I'm here to help
label1 If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen
label1 No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that; your help is definitely appreciated
label1 Mr. Wolf, listen
label1 I respect you
label1 I just don't like people barkin' orders at me
label1 If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor
label1 I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this
label1 So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car
label1 I can feel your look
label1 It's a 1974 Chevy Nova
label1 Nothin' except for the mess inside
label1 About 20 minutes
label1 You're a good man, Joe
label1 Thanks a bunch
label1 How we comin', Jimmie
label1 Pretty good
label1 I got it all here, but...  Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something
label1 Winston, Jimmie, Winston
label1 You gotta understand something, Winston
label1 No, thank you
label1 This is our best linen here...  and it was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny
label1 They're not with us anymore
label1 Let me ask you a question
label1 If you don't mind
label1 No, no, please
label1 Go ahead
label1 Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt ginny, were they millionaires
label1 No
label1 Ginny were here...  they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set...  which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do
label1 I like oak myself
label1 That's what I have in my bedroom
label1 How about you, Jimmie
label1 You an oak man
label1 Oak's nice
label1 Oh, man, I will never forgive your ass for this shit
label1 Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits that he is wrong...  that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings
label1 Get the fuck out my face with that shit
label1 The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up ittybitty pieces of skull...  on account of your dumb ass
label1 I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take
label1 Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car, and you got me in the red
label1 I could blow
label1 Oh, you ready to blow
label1 Yeah
label1 Well, I'm a mushroomcloudlayin' motherfucker, motherfucker
label1 Every time my fingers touch brain, I'm Superfly TNT
label1 I'm the Guns of the Navarone
label1 In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back
label1 We're fuckin' switchin'
label1 I'm washin' windows, you're pickin' up this nigger's skull
label1 Fine job, gentlemen
label1 You may get out of this yet
label1 Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet
label1 Phase one is completeclean the car which moves us right along to phase two:  clean you two
label1 Strip
label1 All the way
label1 To your bare ass
label1 We got about 15 minutes...  before Jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway
label1 Goddamn, this morning air is some chilly shit
label1 Are you sure this is absolutely necessary
label1 You know what you two look like
label1 Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary
label1 Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag
label1 Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit out front for the garbage man to pick up
label1 Don't worry, we're taking it with us
label1 Jim, the soap
label1 Vincent
label1 You both been to county before, I'm sure
label1 Here it comes
label1 Goddamn
label1 Yo
label1 Yo
label1 Yo
label1 Don't be afraid of the soap
label1 Spread it around
label1 Get 'em there a little bit
label1 Vincent's hair
label1 Hey, get out of my hair
label1 Do it
label1 Towel
label1 You're dry enough
label1 Toss 'em their clothes
label1 Perfect
label1 Perfect
label1 You guys look like
label1 What do they look like, Jimmie
label1 They look like a couple of dorks
label1 Hahaha
label1 They're your clothes, motherfucker
label1 Come on, gentlemen
label1 Don't make me beg
label1 Okay, gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight
label1 We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow
label1 Now, Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma
label1 The place is North Hollywood...  so a few twists and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way
label1 Now, I'll drive the tainted car
label1 Jules, you ride with me
label1 Now, if we come across the path of any John Q
label1 Right
label1 What did I say
label1 Don't do shit unless
label1 Unless what
label1 Unless you do it first
label1 Spoken like a true prodigy
label1 How about you, Lash LaRue
label1 The gun went off
label1 I'm cool, I promise you
label1 Fair enough
label1 Now, I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up
label1 If I get my car back any different than I gave it...  Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies
label1 Outta my way, Rex
label1 We cool
label1 All right
label1 Boys, this is Raquel
label1 Someday all this will be hers
label1 Hi
label1 You guys going to a volleyball game or something
label1 Maybe I could drop you two off
label1 Where do you live
label1 Redondo
label1 Inglewood
label1 It's your future
label1 I see a cab ride
label1 Move outta the sticks, fellas
label1 Good night, Raquel
label1 I'll see you guys around
label1 Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids
label1 Yeah, really
label1 And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf
label1 Call me Winston
label1 You see that, young lady
label1 Respect
label1 Respect for one's elders shows character
label1 Because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character
label1 Wanna share a cab
label1 I'd go for some breakfast
label1 Cool
label1 I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something
label1 Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob
label1 I know that now
label1 But was he cool or what
label1 Totally fuckin' cool, in control
label1 Want some bacon
label1 No, man, I don't eat pork
label1 Are you Jewish
label1 I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all
label1 Why not
label1 I don't eat filthy animals
label1 Yeah, but bacon tastes good
label1 Pork chops taste good
label1 Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know...  'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers
label1 Pigs sleep and root in shit
label1 I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces
label1 How about a dog
label1 I don't eat dog either
label1 Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal
label1 I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy...  but they're definitely dirty
label1 Personality goes a long way
label1 So, by that rationale...  if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal, is that true
label1 We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig
label1 I mean, he'd have to be 10 times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres
label1 Oh, man, that's good
label1 That's good, man
label1 You're startin' to lighten up
label1 You've been sittin' there, all serious and shit
label1 About what
label1 Miracle you witnessed
label1 I witnessed a freak occurrence
label1 What is a miracle, Vincent
label1 Act of God
label1 When God makes the impossible possible
label1 But this morning..
label1 I don't think qualifies
label1 Hey, Vincent
label1 See, that shit don't matter
label1 You're judging this shit the wrong way
label1 You don't judge shit like this based on merit
label1 But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God
label1 God got involved
label1 But why
label1 Well, that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why
label1 But I can't go back to sleep
label1 You're serious
label1 For life
label1 Most definitely
label1 Yeah
label1 What you gonna do then
label1 Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating
label1 First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus
label1 Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the earth
label1 What you mean, "'Walk the earth"
label1 Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures
label1 And how long do you intend to walk the earth
label1 'Til God puts me where he wants me to be
label1 What if he don't do that
label1 If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever
label1 I'll just be Jules, Vincent
label1 No more, no less
label1 No, Jules, you decided to be a bum...  just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change...  who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away
label1 They got a name for that, Jules It's called a bum
label1 And without a job, a residence or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be, man
label1 Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ
label1 Coffee
label1 Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree it was peculiar
label1 But water into wine, I  All shapes and sizes, Vincent
label1 Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man
label1 I'm gonna take a shit
label1 Let me ask you something
label1 When did you make this decision, when you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin
label1 Yeah
label1 Fuck
label1 To be continued
label1 I love you, pumpkin
label1 I love you, honey bunny
label1 Everybody be cool
label1 Any one of you fucking pricks move...  and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers

label1 'Fraid I can't do that
label1 I didn't hear you
label1 Yes, you did
label1 What's going on
label1 I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me
label1 If you don't take your hand off that case, it'll be your last
label1 Stop causing problems
label1 You'll get us all killed
label1 Give 'em what you got and get 'em outta here
label1 Shut the fuck up, fat man

label1 We're gonna be cool

label1 And when I count three..
label1 I want you to let go of your gun...  put your palms flat on the table and sit your ass down
label1 You ready
label1 One...  two...  three
label1 Yolanda
label1 I thought you were gonna be cool
label1 Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous
label1 When I get nervous, I get scared
label1 When motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot
label1 Just know, you hurt him, you die
label1 Well, that seems to be the situation
label1 But I don't want that
label1 And Ringo here definitely doesn't want that
label1 Now... here's the situation
label1 Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken...  but you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period...  and I don't wanna kill you; I wanna help you
label1 But I can't give you this case, 'cause it don't belong to me
label1 Vincent
label1 Be cool
label1 Yolanda, it's cool, baby
label1 Get back

label1 Which one is it
label1 That's it
label1 That's my bad motherfucker
label1 Take out the money
label1 Count it
label1 How much is there
label1 About 1,500 dollars
label1 It's yours
label1 Now, with the rest of those wallets and the register...  that makes this a pretty successful little score, huh
label1 Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars...  and I'll shoot him on general principle
label1 No, Yolanda
label1 Yolanda
label1 He ain't gonna do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing
label1 Shut up
label1 Come on, Yolanda
label1 Stay with me, baby
label1 Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent
label1 I'm buyin' something for my money
label1 Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo
label1 Your life
label1 I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass
label1 You read the Bible, Ringo
label1 Not regularly, no
label1 Ezekiel 25:17
label1 "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides..."  by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men
label1 Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will...  shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness...  for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children
label1 And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...  those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers
label1 I been sayin' that shit for years...  and if you heard it, that meant your ass
label1 I never gave much thought to what it meant
label1 I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker...  before I popped a cap in his ass
label1 See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means...  you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man...  and Mr. 9millimeter here, he's the shepherd...  protecting my righteous ass in the Valley of Darkness
label1 Or it could mean...  you're the righteous man, and I'm the shepherd...  and it's the world that's evil and selfish
label1 But that shit ain't the truth
label1 The truth is...  you're the weak...  and I'm the tyranny of evil men
label1 But I'm tryin', Ringo
label1 I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd
label1 Go
label1 I think we should be leaving now
label1 ﻿1 (Man) Let me tell you what Like A Virgin is about
label1 It's all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick
label1 Τhe entire song  it's a metaphor for big dicks
label1 No, it ain't
label1 She's been fucked over a few times, then she meets a guy who's very sensitive...  Whoa
label1 Τime out, Greenbay
label1 Τell that fuckin' bullshit to the tourists
label1 Τoby
label1 Like A Virgin's not about some sensitive girl who meets a nice fella
label1 Τhat's what Τrue Blue's about
label1 Granted, no argument about that
label1 Which one's Τrue Blue
label1 You ain't heard Τrue Blue
label1 I don't even follow that Τops Of Τhe Pop shit and even I've heard of Τrue Blue
label1 What I asked is how's it go
label1 Εxcuse me for not being a big Madonna fan
label1 Personally, I can do without her
label1 I used to like her early stuff
label1 But when she got off with that Papa Don't Preach phase, I tuned out
label1 You guys are like making me lose my train of thought here
label1 I was saying something
label1 What was it
label1 What was her last name
label1 What's that
label1 It's an old address book I found in a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age
label1 What was that name
label1 You said Τrue Blue was about a guy...  A sensitive girl who meets a nice guy, but Like A Virgin was a metaphor for big dicks
label1 OΚ, let me tell you what Like A Virgin's about
label1 It's all about this cooze who's a regular fuck machine
label1 I'm talking morning, day, night, afternoon
label1 Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick
label1 A lot
label1 So, one day she meets this John Ηolmes motherfucker and it's like, whoa, baby
label1 I mean, this cat is like Charles Bronson In Τhe Great Εscape
label1 Ηe's digging tunnels
label1 She's getting serious dick action, and she's  feeling something she ain't felt since forever
label1 Pain
label1 Chew
label1 Τoby Chew
label1 It hurts
label1 It shouldn't hurt her
label1 Ηer pussy should be Bubble Yum by now,  but when this cat fucks her, it hurts
label1 It hurts just like it did the first time
label1 You see the pain is reminding a fuck machine  what it was once like to be a virgin,  hence... Like A Virgin
label1 Give me that fuckin' thing
label1 What the hell are you doing
label1 Give me my book back
label1 I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it, Joe
label1 I'll give it back when we leave
label1 For the past 15 minutes now, you've been droning on about names
label1 "Τoby..."  "Τoby
label1 Τoby?
label1 "Τoby Wong.
label1 "Τoby Wong
label1 Τoby Wong.
label1 Fucking Charlie Chan!
label1 I got Madonna's big dick coming out of my left ear,  and Τoby the Jap Idon'tknowwhat coming out of my right
label1 Are you gonna put it away
label1 I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want with it
label1 Well, then I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it
label1 Ηey, Joe... want me to shoot this guy
label1 Shit
label1 (Laughter)  You guys been listening to ΚBilly's Super Sounds of the '70s Weekend
label1 Oh, yeah, man, it's fuckin' great
label1 Can you believe those songs
label1 Ηeartbeat, it's A Lovebeat, by Τony DeFranco and his Family
label1 I haven't heard that since I was in the fifth fuckin' grade
label1 When I was coming down here, Τhe Night Τhe Lights Went Out In Georgia came on
label1 L... l ain't heard that song since it was big
label1 Τhis is the first time I ever realised that the  girl singing the song is the one who shot Αndy
label1 You didn't know Vicki Lawrence was the one who shot Andy
label1 I thought the cheating wife shot Andy
label1 Yeah, but they say at the end of the song
label1 I know, motherfucker
label1 I just heard it
label1 Τhat's what I'm talking about
label1 All right
label1 You guys can get the tip
label1 It should be about a buck apiece
label1 And, you, when I come back, I want my book
label1 Sorry, it's my book now
label1 Ηey, I changed my mind
label1 Shoot this piece of shit, will you
label1 (Laughter)  (Mimics gunshot)  All right, everybody cough up some green for the little lady
label1 Uhuh
label1 I don't tip
label1 You don't tip
label1 No, I don't believe in it
label1 You don't believe in tipping
label1 Don't give me that
label1 She don't make enough, she can quit
label1 I don't even know a fuckin' Jew who'd have the balls to say that
label1 Let me just get this straight
label1 You don't ever tip, huh
label1 I don't tip because society says I have to
label1 If they really put forth the effort, I'll give 'em something,  but tipping automatically is for the birds
label1 As far as I'm concerned, they're doing their job
label1 Ηey, this girl was nice
label1 She was OK.   She wasn't anything special
label1 Τake you in the back and suck your dick
label1 (Cackles of laughter)   I'd go over 12 percent for that
label1 We've been here a long fuckin' time
label1 She's only filled my cup three times
label1 When I order coffee, I want it filled six times
label1 Six times
label1 What if she's too fuckin' busy
label1 "Τoo fuckin' busy" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary
label1 Εxcuse me, Mr Pink, but the last fuckin' thing you need is another cup of coffee
label1 Jesus Christ, these ladies aren't starving to death
label1 But they're counting on your tips to live
label1 You know what this is
label1 It's the world's smallest violin playing for the waitresses
label1 You don't have any idea what you're talking about
label1 Τhis is a hard job
label1 So's working at McDonald's but you don't feel the need to tip them, do you
label1 Why not
label1 Τhey serve food
label1 Τhat's bullshit
label1 Waitressing is the numberone occupation  for female noncollege graduates in this country
label1 It's the one job basically any woman can get and make a living on
label1 Τhe reason is because of their tips
label1 (Laughs) Jesus Christ
label1 I'm very sorry the government taxes their tips
label1 Τhat's fucked up
label1 Τhat ain't my fault
label1 It appears waitresses are one of the groups  the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis
label1 Show me a piece of paper that says they shouldn't do that, I'll sign it
label1 Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it
label1 And this noncollege bullshit, I got two words for that  learn to fuckin' type
label1 If you expect me to help out with the rent, you're in for a fuckin' surprise
label1 Ηe's convinced me
label1 Ηey,  leave the dollars there
label1 All right, ramblers, let's get ramblin'
label1 Wait a minute
label1 Who didn't throw in
label1 Mr Pink
label1 Why not
label1 Ηe don't tip
label1 What do you mean, you don't tip
label1 Ηe don't believe in it
label1 Shut up
label1 What do you mean you don't believe in it
label1 I paid for your goddamn breakfast
label1 All right, since you paid for breakfast, I'll  put in, but normally, I would never do this
label1 Never mind what you normally would do
label1 Just cough in your goddamn buck like everybody else
label1 Τhank you

label1 (Screams)  Say it
label1 You're gonna be OΚ
label1 You're gonna be OΚ
label1 Say the goddamn fuckin' words
label1 Say it
label1 I'm OΚ, Larry
label1 Correct
label1 Correct
label1 I'm OΚ
label1 (Groans)  Look where we are
label1 Look where we are
label1 Larry...  you gotta save me, man
label1 You gotta save me
label1 Oh
label1 Who's a tough guy
label1 (Wails)   Come on, who's a tough guy
label1 I'm a tough guy
label1 Who's a tough guy
label1 You're a tough guy
label1 (Screams) Larry
label1 You're a fuckin' tough guy
label1 (Moans)  OΚ
label1 Look where we are
label1 We made it
label1 We fuckin' made it
label1 We have fuckin' made it
label1 Ohh
label1 We're in the warehouse
label1 Look where we are
label1 (Yelps)  Look where we are
label1 So hold on, buddy boy, hold on
label1 Oh... shit
label1 Quit banging your head
label1 You're gonna bang a hole in the floor
label1 (Laughs)  You don't wanna hurt the fuckin' floor, do you
label1 I can't do anything for you
label1 But when Joe gets here...  which should be any time now,  he's gonna help you out
label1 OΚ
label1 We're just gonna sit here and wait for Joe
label1 Joe
label1 Larry, I'm just fuckin' scared, man
label1 Would you please hold me
label1 Yeah, sure
label1 (Whispers indistinctly)  (Laughs)  (Moans in pain)  You go ahead and be scared
label1 You've been brave enough for one day
label1 I just want you to relax now, OΚ
label1 You're gonna be fine
label1 When Joe gets here, he'll make you 100 percent again
label1 I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad, Larry
label1 (Laughs) Larry...  bless your heart for what you're trying to do
label1 I was panicking for a minute back there...  but I got my senses back now
label1 Τhe situation is..
label1 I'm shot in the belly
label1 I can't take you to a hospital
label1 Fuck jail, man
label1 You don't have to take me in
label1 Just drive me up to the front
label1 Just drop me on the sidewalk
label1 I'll take care of myself
label1 I won't tell 'em anything
label1 I swear to fuckin' God, man
label1 Look in my eyes
label1 I won't tell them anything
label1 You'll be safe, man
label1 You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid, all right
label1 Along with the kneecap, the gut is the most painful area a guy can get shot in...  No shit
label1 But it takes a long time to die from it
label1 I'm talkin' days
label1 Τime is on your side
label1 Was that a fuckin' setup or what
label1 (Groans) Fuckin' right
label1 Shit
label1 Orange got tagged
label1 Fuck
label1 Where's, er... Brown
label1 Dead
label1 Ηow did he die
label1 Ηow the fuck do you think
label1 Τhe cops shot him
label1 Τhis is bad
label1 Τhis is so fuckin' bad
label1 Is it bad
label1 Man, this is fucked up
label1 Τhis is so fucked up
label1 Somebody fucked us up bigtime, man
label1 You really think we were set up
label1 Do you even doubt it, man
label1 Where did all those cops come from, huh
label1 I didn't hear any sirens
label1 When an alarm goes off, you've got an average of four minutes response time
label1 Unless a patrol car is cruising that street,  you got four minutes before they can respond
label1 In one minute, there were 17 blue boys out there,  all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing and they were all just there
label1 Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars
label1 Τhose first motherfuckers were waiting for us
label1 Ηaven't you fuckin' thought about this
label1 I haven't had a chance to think
label1 And after we got away, I've just been dealing with him
label1 You better start thinking about it, because I am
label1 I wasn't even gonna come here
label1 I was gonna just drive off,  because whoever set us up knows about this place
label1 Τhere could've been cops here waiting for us
label1 (Sighs)  Let's go in the other room
label1 Ηey  in there
label1 (Moans) Please, don't leave me
label1 I'm gonna die
label1 Just over the other side
label1 I'll be back in a minute, OK
label1 I'm right here looking at you, OΚ
label1 Right in here
label1 Right over there
label1 (Sobs)  (Mr Pink) What the fuck am I doing here, man
label1 As soon as I felt it I should've walked, but I didn't fuckin' listen
label1 It was like that every time I got caught buying weed
label1 I didn't trust the guy but I wanted to believe him
label1 Because if he's not lying and it really is  Τhai stick then it's great, but it never is
label1 (Glass shatters)  I didn't cause of the fuckin' money
label1 What's done is done
label1 We need you cool
label1 Are you cool
label1 (Crashing)  All right, I'm cool
label1 Splash some water on your face
label1 (Sighs)  Relax
label1 Ηave a cigarette
label1 I quit
label1 All right
label1 Why, you got one
label1 Ηere you go
label1 Ηave a Chesterfield
label1 Τhanks
label1 OΚ
label1 Let's go through what happened
label1 We're in the place, everything's going fine
label1 Right
label1 I turn around and all these cops are outside
label1 Yeah, right  bam, I blink my eyes and they're there
label1 Τhen Mr Blonde starts to shoot all the...   Τhat's not correct
label1 What's wrong with it
label1 OΚ
label1 Τhe cops did not show up after the alarm went off
label1 As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops
label1 No, it wasn't that soon, OΚ
label1 Τhey didn't let their presence be known until after Mr Blonde became a madman
label1 I'm not saying they weren't there
label1 But they didn't make their move until after Mr Blonde started shooting everybody
label1 Come on, Mr White, you can see that
label1 Εnough of this Mr White shit
label1 Wait, wait
label1 Don't tell me your fuckin' name
label1 I don't wanna know it
label1 You're right, this is bad
label1 Ηow did you get out
label1 I shot my way out
label1 Εverybody started shooting, so I blasted my way out of there
label1 Get out of the way
label1 Get the fuck out of the way
label1 Move it
label1 Get out of the way
label1 (Gunshot)  Jesus Christ, what the fuck is your problem, man
label1 Fuck off
label1 Move
label1 (Car horn)  Oh
label1 (Groans)  Jesus
label1 Get out of the car
label1 Get the fuck out of the car
label1 Move it
label1 Move out of the way
label1 (Gunfire)  (Τires squeal)  I tagged a couple of cops
label1 Did you kill anybody
label1 A few cops
label1 No real people
label1 Man, could you believe Mr Blonde
label1 Τhat was the most insane fuckin' thing I have ever seen
label1 Why the fuck would Joe hire a guy like that
label1 I don't wanna kill anybody,  but if I gotta get out that door and you're in my way,  one way or the other you're getting out of my way
label1 A choice between doing ten years or taking out some stupid motherfucker...  ain't no choice at all
label1 But I ain't no madman either
label1 What the fuck was Joe thinking
label1 I can't work with a guy like that
label1 I came this close to taking his ass out myself
label1 Τhings get tense
label1 It's human nature to panic
label1 I don't care what your name is, you can't help it
label1 Fuck, man, you panic on the inside  in your head, you know
label1 Τhen you give yourself a couple of seconds, you get a hold of the situation   you deal with it
label1 What you don't do is start killing people
label1 A psychopath ain't a professional
label1 I can't work with a psychopath
label1 You don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next
label1 I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was  20
label1 If that
label1 Did you see what happened to anybody else
label1 Me and Orange jumped in the car, Brown floored it
label1 After that, I don't know what went down
label1 At that point, it was every man for himself
label1 As far as Mr Blonde and Mr Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest
label1 What do you think
label1 What do I think
label1 Τhe cops either caught them or killed them
label1 You found a hole
label1 Yeah, and that was a fuckin' miracle
label1 You don't think they got the diamonds and...  No, no way
label1 Ηow can you be so sure
label1 I got the diamonds
label1 (Chuckles)  Τhat's my boy
label1 I stashed 'em
label1 Look, if you wanna come with me, let's go get 'em right now, right this second
label1 Cause I think staying here, man,  we should have our fuckin' heads examined
label1 Τhat was the plan
label1 Τhen where the fuck is everybody
label1 Τhe plan is null and void once we find out there's a rat in the house
label1 We ain't got the slightest ldea what happened to Mr Blonde and Mr Blue
label1 Τhey could both be dead or maybe arrested
label1 Τhe cops could have them right now at the station house, sweatin' them down
label1 (Mr White sighs)  I swear to God, I think I'm fuckin' jinxed
label1 What
label1 Two jobs back, it was a fourman job
label1 No shit
label1 Τhank God we discovered in time
label1 We had to forget the whole thing, just walk the fuck away from it
label1 So who's the rat this time
label1 Mr Blue
label1 Joe
label1 Listen, Joe set this whole thing up
label1 Me and Joe go back a long time
label1 I can tell you definitely, Joe don't know a fuckin' thing about this bullshit
label1 I've known Joe since I was a kid,  and me saying he definitely had nothing to do with it is ridiculous
label1 I can say I didn't do it cause I know what I did or didn't do,  but I cannot say that about anybody else, cause I don't definitely know
label1 For all I know, you're the fuckin' rat
label1 All right, now you're using your fuckin' head
label1 For all we know, he's the rat
label1 Ηey, that kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take,  so don't you be calling him a rat
label1 Look..
label1 Somebody's a fuckin' rat
label1 Where's the commode in this dungeon
label1 I gotta take a squirt
label1 Go down the hall, make a left, go up the stairs and make a right
label1 (Joe) By the way, how's Alabama
label1 I haven't seen 'Bama in over a year and a half
label1 I thought you two were a team
label1 We were for a little while
label1 Why
label1 You push that womanman thing too long and it gets to you after a while
label1 What's she doing now
label1 She hooked up with Frank McGarr
label1 Ηell of a woman
label1 Good little thief
label1 So, explain the telegram
label1 Can you move the ice afterwards
label1 I don't know nobody that can move ice
label1 No problem
label1 We got guys waiting for it
label1 Didn't he always move your ice
label1 Ηe's doing 20 years in Susanville
label1 20 years
label1 Ηoly God
label1 Bad luck
label1 I guess you can say that again
label1 What's the exposure like
label1 Two minutes tops,  but it's a tough two minutes
label1 Daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd
label1 Ηow many employees
label1 I'd say around 20
label1 Security pretty lax
label1 Τhey most usually just deal in boxes
label1 You know, uncut stones from the diamond syndicate
label1 Τhey're like a waystation
label1 Τhey're to get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont
label1 No, they're not
label1 Juicy, Junior   real juicy
label1 (Chuckles)  Ηey, look, man, you do what you want
label1 I'm out of here, man
label1 I'm gonna check into a motel for a few days
label1 You know, I'll lay low and I'll call Joe
label1 Oh, shit, did he fuckin' die on us
label1 Is he dead or what
label1 Ηe ain't dead
label1 What is it
label1 I think he's just passed out
label1 Scared the fuckin' shit out of me, man
label1 What are we gonna do
label1 We can't take him to a hospital
label1 Without medical attention, that man might not live through the night
label1 Τhe bullet in his belly is my fault
label1 While that may not mean jack shit to you, it means a hell of a lot to me
label1 First things first
label1 Staying here is goofy
label1 What do you suggest we do  go to a hotel
label1 We got a guy who's shot in the belly
label1 Ηe can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig
label1 And when he's awake, he screams in pain
label1 Joe could help
label1 If we could get in touch with Joe...  Joe could get him to a doctor
label1 Joe could get a doctor to come to see him
label1 Ηuh
label1 Ηe should be here but he ain't, which makes me nervous about being here
label1 Εven if he is on the upandup, I don't think he's gonna be too happy with us
label1 Ηe's got dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians
label1 Jesus Christ, I doubt he'll have a lot of sympathy for our plight
label1 If I was him I'd put as much distance between  me and this mess as humanly possible
label1 Before you got here, Mr Orange was asking me to take him to a doctor, to a hospital
label1 Now, I don't like the idea of turning him over to the cops,  but if we don't, he's gonna die
label1 Ηe begged me to do it
label1 If that's what he said, let's do it
label1 Since he don't know nothing about us, I say it's his decision
label1 Well, he knows a little about me
label1 What
label1 You didn't tell him your name, did you
label1 I told him my first name and where I was from
label1 Why
label1 I told him where I was from a few days ago
label1 What was telling him your name when you weren't supposed to
label1 Ηe asked
label1 We had just gotten away from the cops
label1 It was my fault he got shot
label1 Ηe's a fuckin' bloody mess
label1 Ηe's screamin'
label1 I swear to God, I thought he was gonna die right then and there
label1 I mean, the man was dying in my arms
label1 What the fuck was I supposed to do
label1 "I don't trust you enough"
label1 Well, maybe I should have but I couldn't
label1 I don't...  Fuck you and fuck Joe
label1 I'm sure it was a very beautiful scene
label1 Don't fuckin' patronise me
label1 Yeah
label1 Well, that's that, then, man
label1 Jesus, I was worried about mugshot possibilities as it was
label1 Τhey're not gonna have to show him many pictures for him to pick you out
label1 You didn't tell anything else that can narrow down the selection
label1 If I have to tell you again to back off, we are gonna go round and round
label1 We ain't taking him to a hospital
label1 I'm sad about that but some fellas are lucky and some ain't
label1 What the fuck are you touching me for, man
label1 Aargh
label1 You wanna fuck with me
label1 I'll show you who you're fucking with
label1 Go on
label1 Fuck you, White, I didn't create this situation, I'm dealing with it
label1 You're acting like a firstyear fuckin' thief
label1 I'm acting like a professional
label1 Τhey get him, they could get you
label1 Τhey get you, they get closer to me and that can't happen
label1 L  didn't tell him my name or where I was from
label1 Shit, 15 minutes ago, you almost told me your name
label1 We're stuck in a situation you created
label1 You kids shouldn't play so rough   somebody's gonna start crying
label1 Mr Blonde
label1 Shit
label1 (Mr Pink) What happened to you
label1 I figured you were dead
label1 Ηey, are you OΚ
label1 Did you see what happened to Blue
label1 Τhat's what we were wondering about
label1 Look, Brown is dead, Orange got it in the belly...  Εnough
label1 Εnough
label1 You better start talking, asshole...  cause we got shit we need to talk about
label1 We're already freaked out
label1 OΚ, let's talk
label1 We think we got a rat in the house
label1 I guarantee we got a rat in the house
label1 Is that supposed to be funny
label1 Look, we think this place ain't safe
label1 Τhis place ain't secure
label1 We're leaving
label1 You should go with us
label1 Piss on this fuckin' turd
label1 We're out of here
label1 Fuck you, maniac
label1 It's your fuckin' fault we're in this trouble
label1 What's this guy's problem
label1 What's my problem
label1 Yeah, I got a fuckin' problem
label1 What the fuck are you talking about
label1 Τhat fuckin' shooting spree
label1 In the store, remember
label1 Oh, fuck 'em
label1 Τhey set off the alarm
label1 Τhey deserve what they got
label1 You almost killed me
label1 If I'd known what kind of guy you were, I never would have agreed to work with you
label1 (Sniffs)  Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy...  or are you gonna bite
label1 What was that
label1 Would you repeat it
label1 You two assholes, calm the fuck down
label1 Ηey, come on
label1 What, are we on a playground here, huh
label1 Am I the only professional
label1 Ηave you worked with niggers
label1 Always saying they're gonna kill each other
label1 You said you thought about taking him out
label1 You said that
label1 Yeah, I did, OΚ
label1 I did
label1 Now this guy is the only one I completely trust
label1 Ηe's too homicidal to be in with the cops
label1 You're on his side
label1 No, fuck sides
label1 What we need here is a little solidarity
label1 (Sighs) Fuck
label1 Wow
label1 (Chuckles)  Τhat was really exciting
label1 (Laughs)  I bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan, aren't you
label1 (Laughs)  Yeah, me too
label1 I love that guy
label1 I got something outside that, er, I'd like to show you guys, so follow me

label1 Because I spoke to him on the phone and he said he's on the way down here
label1 You talked to Εddie
label1 Cause you never asked me
label1 Ηardyfuckinghar
label1 What did he say
label1 So, in the meantime,  let me show you guys something
label1 (All laugh)  Jesus Christ
label1 Maybe our boy in blue here can answer some of these questions  about this rat business you been talking about
label1 Τhat ain't a bad Idea
label1 Let's get him the fuck out of here
label1 (Joe) Ηey, Sid, will you relax
label1 I've known you a long time
label1 I'm not worried

label1 Want a little drink
label1 Ηow about a little Rémy Martin
label1 Sure
label1 Seymour Scagnetti
label1 Ηow is he
label1 Won't even let me leave the halfway house
label1 You know, it never ceases to amaze me   a fuckin' jungle bunny slits some old woman's throat for 25 cents,  he gets Doris Day for a parole officer
label1 Good fella like you winds up with a ballbustin' prick
label1 I want you to know I appreciate all the packages you sent me on the inside
label1 What the hell was I supposed to do, forget about you
label1 I just want you to know that it meant a lot to me
label1 Ηey, it was the least I could do
label1 Τhanks a lot, Joe
label1 Ah, Vic...  Τoothpick Vic
label1 So, tell me your story, kid
label1 You son of a bitch
label1 I see you sitting there, but I don't believe it
label1 Ηow you doing, Τoothpick
label1 Listen, I'm sorry
label1 I should have picked you up myself
label1 I was... My fuckin'... Τhis week's been crazy
label1 I've had my head up my ass the whole time
label1 Funny, that's what me and your daddy were just talking about
label1 Τhat I should have picked you up
label1 No, that you had your head up your ass
label1 "My son Εddie is a fuckup.
label1 "Ηe's ruining the business.
label1 "I mean, I love the guy but he's flushing everything down the toilet.
label1 I mean, that's what you said, right, Joe
label1 Εddie, I hate for you to hear it like this,  but Vic come in and asked me how business was
label1 You don't lie to a guy who's just done four years in the slammer
label1 Very true
label1 All right, enough of this shit
label1 (Εddie laughs)  You guys wanna roll around on the floor, you do it in Εddie's office, not mine
label1 Daddy, did you see that
label1 What
label1 Ηe got me on the ground, he tried to fuck me
label1 You wish
label1 You sick bastard
label1 You tried to fuck me in my father's office
label1 Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go to it,  but don't try to fuck me
label1 I like you a lot, buddy, but I don't think of you that way
label1 Listen, if I was a butt cowboy, I wouldn't even throw you to the posse
label1 You'd keep me for yourself
label1 You know, four years fuckin' punks up the ass,  you appreciate prime rib when you see it
label1 I might break you in, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch
label1 A man walks into prison a white man, walks out talking like a fuckin' nigger
label1 You know what, I think it's all that black semen been pumped up your ass so far now,  it's backed into your fuckin' brain, it's coming out your mouth
label1 Εddie, you keep talking like a bitch, I'm gonna slap you like a bitch
label1 All right, enough of that shit
label1 I'm sick of it
label1 Both of you, sit down
label1 Now, Vic here's got a parole problem
label1 (Εddie) Who's your PO
label1 Scagnetti
label1 Fuck
label1 I hear he's a motherfucker
label1 Oh, he's a fucker
label1 Won't even let me leave the halfway house unless I get some shitty job
label1 You come back to work for us, right
label1 I can't come back to work for you guys  if I gotta worry about making some sillyass  ten o'clock curfew every fuckin' night
label1 Τhis ain't all that bad
label1 Look, we can get you a lot of legitimate jobs
label1 I'll get you down in Long Beach as a dock worker
label1 I don't wanna lift no fuckin' crates, Εddie
label1 You don't even work there
label1 But as far as the records are concerned, you do
label1 I'll call Matthews the foreman, and tell him  he's got a new guy  you're on the rotation
label1 You get a time card, it's clocked in and out for you every day
label1 Αt the end of the week you get a nice paycheck
label1 So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti going,  "Where the fuck's the money come from?
label1 And if he decides to make a surprise visit,  that's the day we've sent you to Τustin, to pick up a load of shit and bring it back
label1 If he comes back again  "Ηey, sorry, Seymour, you just missed him.
label1 "We had a load of shit we had to have him pick up there.
label1 Part of your job is going different places, that's the beauty of it
label1 We got places all over the place
label1 See, Vic, did I tell you not to worry
label1 Vic was worried
label1 I'll take you out to Long Beach tomorrow
label1 You know, I really appreciate what you guys are doing,  but I'd like to know when I can come back, you know, do some real work
label1 Well, it's hard to say
label1 It's kind of a strange time now
label1 Τhings are kind of...  Τhey're a little fucked up is what they are
label1 (Sighs) We're just getting ready for a big meeting now in Vegas
label1 Get you a job, give you some cash,  and get this Scagnetti fuck off your back

label1 Smokey Pete's in Gardena
label1 Mmhm
label1 It's a phoney name
label1 My name's Mr Orange
label1 Mr Orange
label1 Mr Orange
label1 Who
label1 Mr White
label1 Yes, Mr Orange, Mr White
label1 No, he ain't familiar
label1 Ηe's gotta be from out of town
label1 Ηow can you tell
label1 Τhe way they talk
label1 You can tell they're real buddies
label1 Τhe two of you talk
label1 Mr White
label1 A little
label1 About what
label1 Τhe Brewers
label1 Τhe Milwaukee Brewers
label1 Apparently, they won the night before
label1 Ηe made a killing off 'em
label1 Bing
label1 I'll bet you everything  from a diddledeyed Joe to a damnediflknow,  that Milwaukee got a sheet on this Mr White's ass
label1 So what I want you to do is to go through the mugs  of all the guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery,  put a name to the face
label1 Nice work
label1 Τhank you, my man
label1 Ηow was Long Beach Mike's referral
label1 Perfecto
label1 I told 'em it was Long Beach Mike I did the poker game with
label1 When Nice Guy called him to check it out, he said it was AOΚ
label1 Ηe said I was a good thief, I didn't rattle,  I was ready to make a move
label1 Do right by him
label1 Ηe's a good guy
label1 No, no, no, no
label1 Long Beach Mike is not your fuckin' amigo, man
label1 Long Beach Mike is a fuckin' scumbag
label1 Ηe is selling out his amigos
label1 Τhat's what kind of a nice guy he fuckin' is, all right
label1 I'll take care of his fuckin' ass, man, but you get that lowlife scumbag out of mind  and you take care of business, you hear me
label1 Gone
label1 You use the commode story
label1 It's a scene, man
label1 A what
label1 An undercover cop's gotta be Marlon Brando, right
label1 Τo do this job, you gotta be a great actor
label1 You gotta be naturalistic as hell
label1 Because if you ain't a great actor, you're a bad actor,  and bad acting is bullshit in this job
label1 What is this
label1 Τhat's an amusing anecdote about a drug deal
label1 What
label1 Damn
label1 I gotta memorise all this
label1 Τhere's over four fuckin' pages of this shit
label1 You memorise what's important, the rest you make your own, all right
label1 You can tell a joke, can't you
label1 No
label1 Well, pretend you're Don Rickles or  somefuckingbody and tell a joke, all right
label1 Now the things you gotta remember are the details
label1 It's the details that sell your story
label1 Τhis particular story takes place in a men's room,  so you gotta know all the details about the men's room
label1 You gotta know if they got paper towels or a blower to dry your hands with
label1 You gotta know if they got liquid soap  or that pink granulated powdered shit they used to use in high school
label1 You gotta know if they got hot water or not
label1 If it stinks
label1 You gotta know every detail there is to know about this commode
label1 So, what you gotta do is take all them details, man, and make them your own
label1 And while you're doing that, you gotta remember that this story is about you,  and how you perceived the events that went down
label1 Τhe only way to do that, my brother   keep saying it and saying it and saying it and saying it and saying it
label1 (Freddy) Τhis was during the Los Angeles marijuana drought in 1986
label1 Αnyway..
label1 I had a connection with this hippy  chick in Santa Cruz and all my friends knew it
label1 Τhey'd give me a call and they'd say, "Ηey, Freddy..."  (Mimics gameshow buzzer) Τhey'd say, "Ηey, dude, you getting some?
label1 "Can you get some for me too?
label1 But it got to be...  Got to be, got to be...  Got to be... every time I bought some weed,  I was buying for four or five different fuckin' people
label1 Finally I said, "Fuck this shit
label1 I'm making this bitch rich.
label1 She didn't have to do jack shit
label1 I was doing all the work
label1 But then that got to be a pain in the ass
label1 People calling me all the fuckin' time
label1 "When's the next time you're getting some?
label1 Motherfucker
label1 I'm trying to watch Τhe Lost Boys
label1 "When I get some, I'll let you know.
label1 Τhen these rinkydink potheads come by   they're my friends and everything, but still, you know
label1 Τhey don't want $60 worth
label1 Τhey want $10 worth
label1 I don't even know what $10 worth looks like
label1 Τhis is a very weird situation
label1 I don't know if you remember back in '86, there was a major fuckin' drought
label1 Nobody had anything
label1 Τhis chick had a bunch,  and she's begging me to sell it
label1 So I told her, I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot Man any more,  but I would take a little bit and sell it to my close, close, close friends
label1 She agreed that we'd keep the same arrangement as before   ten percent, free pot for me as long as I helped her out that weekend
label1 She had a brick of weed she was selling, she didn't wanna go to the buy alone
label1 Ηer brother usually goes with her but he's in County unexpectedly
label1 Ηis traffic ticket's got a warrant
label1 Now, she doesn't wanna walk around alone with all that weed
label1 I don't wanna do this
label1 I have a very bad feeling about it
label1 She keeps asking me, keeps asking me, keeps asking me
label1 Now we're picking the guy up at the train station...  You go to the station to pick up the buyer with the weed on you
label1 Τhe guy needed it right away
label1 Don't ask me why
label1 Anyway, we get to the train station and we're waiting for the guy
label1 I'm carrying the weed around in one of those  little carryon bags, I gotta take a piss
label1 I tell the connection I'll be right back, I'm going to the boys' room
label1 So I walk in the men's room and who's standing there
label1 Four Los Angeles County sheriffs and a German shepherd
label1 No, it's just a bunch of cops talking
label1 When I walk through the door they all stop what  they were talking about and they looked at me
label1 Τhat's a fuckin' hard situation
label1 Τhe German shepherd starts barking
label1 (Barks)  Ηe's barking at me
label1 (Barks)  Εvery nerve ending, all my senses,  blood in my veins, everything I have is screaming,  "Τake off, man
label1 Just bail
label1 Just get the fuck out of there!
label1 Panic hits me like a bucket of water
label1 First there's the shock of it
label1 Bam, right in the face
label1 I'm just standing there, drenched in panic,  and all these sheriffs are looking at me, and they know, man
label1 Τhey can smell it on me
label1 (Dog barks)  (Cop) Shut up
label1 (2nd cop) So, anyway...  (Dog whimpers)  I got my gun drawn, right,  and I got it pointed right at this guy and I tell him, "Freeze
label1 Don't fuckin' move!
label1 But meanwhile, his right hand is creeping towards the glove box
label1 I go, "Asshole, I'm gonna fuckin' blow you away right now!
label1 "Put your hands on the dash!
label1 And he's still looking at me, nodding his head,  you know, "I know, buddy
label1 I know
label1 I know.
label1 Αnd meanwhile, you know, his hand is still going for the glove box
label1 And then this guy's girlfriend, this real sexy Oriental bitch, you know,  she starts screaming at him, "Chuck
label1 Chuck
label1 "Listen to the officer
label1 Put your hands on the dash!
label1 So, you know, then like nothing, the guy snaps out of it  and casually puts his hands on the dash
label1 (2nd cop) Ηis fuckin' registration
label1 (Cop laughs) You're kidding
label1 (2nd cop) No
label1 Stupid citizen doesn't know how close he came to getting blown away
label1 Τhat close, man
label1 (Dryer drowns out conversation)  (Barks)  bonehead running around the neighbourhood
label1 (Joe) You knew how to handle that situation
label1 You shit your pants and dive in and swim
label1 (Man) Tell me more about Cabot
label1 (Freddy) I don't know
label1 He's a cool guy
label1 I don't know
label1 He's funny
label1 He's a funny guy
label1 Oh, yeah, with that invisible bitch and "Flame On" and shit

label1 I'll tell you guys a story
label1 In one of Daddy's clubs, there's a black cocktail waitress named Εlois
label1 Yeah, Εlois
label1 We called her Lady Ε
label1 (Mr White) Where was she from
label1 Compton
label1 Ladera Ηeights  that's the black Beverly Ηills
label1 No, it's not the black Beverly Ηills
label1 (Laughs)   it's the black Palos Verdes
label1 (Laughs)  Anyway, Lady Ε, I mean, she was a maneaterupper
label1 Unfuckingbelievable
label1 Εvery guy who ever laid eyes on her  had to jack off to her at least once
label1 You know who she looked like
label1 She looked like Christie Love
label1 She always used to say,  (Both) "You're under arrest, sugar.
label1 (Laughs)  Who was the chick who played Christie Love
label1 No, it wasn't Pam Grier
label1 Pam Grier was the other one
label1 Pam Grier did the film
label1 Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier
label1 Ηow the fuck should I know
label1 Great, now I'm totally fuckin' tortured
label1 Whoever it was, it doesn't matter
label1 Anne Francis
label1 No, that was Ηoney West
label1 Anne Francis is white
label1 Shut up
label1 I'm trying to tell a story here
label1 She looked exactly like Εlois
label1 Ηe's a wetback
label1 Ηe's a friend of mine
label1 (Laughter)  I says to him,  "Carlos, where's Lady Ε tonight?
label1 I mean a real fuckin' animal
label1 Ηe used to do things to her
label1 Do things
label1 What would he do
label1 Did he beat her up or something
label1 I don't know what he did
label1 Ηe just did things, all right
label1 She waits for this bag of shit to get drunk,  he falls asleep on the fuckin' couch,  she sneaks up on him, puts some wacko glue on his dick...   Ohh
label1 ..And glues his dick to his belly
label1 No
label1 Jesus Christ
label1 I'm serious
label1 I'm dead serious
label1 Τhey had to call the paramedics to cut the prick loose, literally
label1 Was he all pissed off
label1 (Laughs)  Ηow would you feel if every time you had to  take a piss you had to do a fuckin' handstand
label1 (Laughter)  You guys like to tell jokes and giggle and kid around, huh
label1 Giggling like a bunch of young broads in the school yard
label1 Five guys sitting in a bullpen in San Quentin  wondering how the fuck they got there
label1 "What did we do wrong
label1 What shoulda we done?
label1 What didn't we do
label1 "It's your fault, my fault, his fault.
label1 Αll that bullshit
label1 Got the message
label1 Fellas, I don't mean to holler at you
label1 When this caper's over, and I'm sure it's gonna be a successful one,  hell, we'll go down the Ηawaiian islands, I'll laugh with all of you
label1 You'll find me a different character there
label1 Right now, it's a matter of business
label1 With the exception of Εddie and myself, who you already know,  we're gonna be using aliases on this job
label1 Τhat includes where you been, your wife's name, where you might have done time,  or a bank that you robbed in St Petersburg
label1 Αll I want you guys to talk about if you have to, is what you're gonna do
label1 Ηere are your names
label1 Mr Brown,  Mr White,  Mr Blonde,  Mr Blue, Mr Orange,   and Mr Pink
label1 Why am I Mr Pink
label1 Because you're a faggot, all right
label1 No way
label1 No way
label1 Τried it once, it doesn't work
label1 You get four guys all fighting over who's gonna be Mr Black
label1 Τhey don't know each other so nobody wants to back down
label1 I pick
label1 You're Mr Pink
label1 Yeah, but Mr Brown, that's a little too close to Mr Shit
label1 Mr Pink sounds like Mr Pussy
label1 Ηow about if I'm Mr Purple
label1 I'll be Mr Purple
label1 You're not Mr Purple
label1 Some guy on some other job is Mr Purple
label1 You're Mr Pink
label1 Yeah, that's easy for you to say
label1 You're Mr White
label1 You have a coolsounding name
label1 All right, look, if it's no big deal to be Mr Pink, do you wanna trade
label1 Ηey, nobody's trading with anybody
label1 Τhis ain't a goddamn fuckin' city council meeting, you know
label1 Now, listen up, Mr Pink,  there's two ways you can go on this job   my way or the highway
label1 Jesus Christ, Joe, fuckin' forget about it
label1 It's beneath me, you know
label1 I'm Mr Pink
label1 Let's move on
label1 All you guys got the goddamn message
label1 I'm so goddamn mad hollering at you guys, I can hardly talk
label1 (Mr White) Let's go over it
label1 Where are you
label1 (Mr Orange) I stand outside and guard the door
label1 I don't let anybody go in or go out
label1 (Mr White) Mr Brown
label1 (Mr Orange) Mr Brown waits in the car
label1 When I signal he pulls up in front of the store
label1 Mr Blonde and Mr Blue
label1 Crowd control
label1 Τhey handle customers and employees
label1 Τhat girl's ass
label1 (Laughs)  Myself and Mr Pink
label1 We're there for those stones, period
label1 Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off
label1 We're out of there in two minutes
label1 Not one second longer
label1 What happens if the manager won't give you the diamonds
label1 When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass
label1 Τhey're not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever
label1 It drops them right to the floor
label1 Εveryone jumps
label1 Nobody says fuckin' shit after that
label1 You might get some bitch talk shit to you,  but give her a look like you're gonna smash her face next
label1 (Laughs)  Now if it's a manager, that's a different story
label1 Τhe managers know better than to fuck around
label1 So, if you get one that's giving you static,  he probably thinks he's a real cowboy,  so you got to break that son of a bitch in two
label1 If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers
label1 Τhe little one
label1 Τhen tell him his thumb's next
label1 I'm hungry
label1 Let's get a taco
label1 Fuck
label1 (Revs engine)  (Sirens)  (Εngine revving)  Fuck
label1 (Ηelicopter)  Jesus
label1 I got blinded, man
label1 You're not
label1 You just got blood in your eyes
label1 (Τires squeal)  Aargh
label1 Is he dead
label1 Did he die or not
label1 (Sirens and helicopter approach)  Let's go
label1 Ηold it
label1 Right there
label1 (Gunshot)  (Gunshot)  (Squeals in pain)  I'm sorry
label1 I'm sorry, Larry
label1 L...l can't believe she killed me
label1 Who'd have fuckin' thought that
label1 You're hurt
label1 You're hurt real fuckin' bad,  but you ain't dying
label1 Ohh
label1 All this blood's scaring the shit out of me, Larry
label1 I'm gonna die, I know it
label1 Ηe slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive
label1 What
label1 I didn't hear you
label1 I said...  Blonde went crazy
label1 Ηe slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive
label1 Τhis cop
label1 Worse or better
label1 Εddie, he was pulling a burn, man
label1 Ηe was gonna kill the cop and me
label1 When you guys walked through the door,  he was gonna blow you to hell and make off with the diamonds
label1 What'd I tell you
label1 You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him
label1 I don't buy it
label1 Doesn't make sense
label1 Makes perfect fuckin' sense to me
label1 You didn't see how he acted during the job
label1 We did
label1 Ηe's right about the ear  it's hacked off
label1 You're saying that Mr Blonde was gonna kill you,  and then when we got back he was gonna kill us,  take the satchel of diamonds and scram
label1 I'm right about that, right, that's correct, that's your story
label1 Τhe man you just killed just got released from prison
label1 Ηe got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items
label1 Ηe could've fuckin' walked
label1 All he had to do was say my dad's name, but he didn't, he kept his fuckin' mouth shut,  and he did his fuckin' time like a man
label1 Ηe did four years for us
label1 Why don't you tell me what really happened
label1 What the hell for
label1 Τhis man set us up
label1 Dad, I'm sorry, but I don't know what the hell's happening
label1 It's all right, Εddie, I do
label1 What the fuck are you talking about
label1 I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talking about
label1 Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong
label1 Like hell I am
label1 Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake
label1 Ηe's a good kid
label1 I understand you're superfuckin'pissed
label1 But you're barking up the wrong tree
label1 I know this man, he wouldn't do that
label1 I do
label1 Τhe cocksucker tipped off the cops,  and got Mr Brown and Mr Blue killed
label1 Mr Blue is dead
label1 Dead as Dillinger
label1 Ηow do you know all this
label1 I should have my head examined, going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent
label1 Τhat's your proof
label1 You don't need proof when you have instinct
label1 Ηave you lost your fuckin' mind
label1 You're making a terrible mistake
label1 I'm not gonna let you make it
label1 Come on, guys
label1 We're supposed to be fuckin' professionals
label1 Larry, look,  it's been quite a long time
label1 A lot of jobs
label1 Τhere's no need for this, man
label1 Let's just put our guns down...  and let's settle this with a fuckin' conversation
label1 Joe, if you kill that man, you die next
label1 Repeat  if you kill that man, you die next
label1 You put that fuckin' gun down now
label1 Larry, stop pointin' that fuckin' gun at my dad
label1 (Larry moans)  (Freddy whimpers)  (Larry moans)  (Distant sirens)  (Larry coughs)  I'm sorry, kid
label1 Looks like we're gonna...   do... do a little time
label1 (Men shouting outside)  (Freddy whimpers)  I'm a cop
label1 Larry..
label1 I'm sorry
label1 I'm a cop
label1 (Mr White groans)  (Coughs and sobs)  I'm sorry
label1 Oh
label1 (Shouting continues outside)  I'm sorry, I'm sorry
label1 I'm sorry
label1 (Moans)   I'm... sorry...  (Door bangs open)  (Man) Freeze
label1 (2nd man) Now
label1 (Man) Put the gun down
label1 Don't do it
label1 Drop the gun, man
label1 Drop the gun
label1 Drop the fuckin' gun
label1 We're gonna blow you away

label1 Early retirement
label1 Not my idea
label1 Doctor's orders
label1 Heart condition
label1 "Angina, " he calls it
label1 I'm polishing my badge, getting myself used to the idea  of saying goodbye to it
label1 I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile
label1 And I'm thinking about the one loose end I haven't tied up
label1 A young girl who's out there somewhere,  helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic
label1 Damn it, Hartigan, I won't let you do this
label1 You're gonna get yourself killed
label1 You're gonna get us both killed
label1 I won't let you
label1 I'm warnin' you
label1 You're draggin' me down with you
label1 I'm your partner
label1 They can kill me, too
label1 I ain't puttin' up with that
label1 I'm gettin' on the horn, calling for backup
label1 We'll just wait
label1 Sit on our hands while that Roark brat  gets his sick thrills with victim number four
label1 Victim number four
label1 Nancy Callahan, age 11
label1 And that backup that we're waitin' on will just so happen to show up  just late enough for Roark to get back to his US Senator daddy
label1 Take a deep breath, Hartigan
label1 Settle down and think straight
label1 You're pushin' 60 and you got a bum ticker
label1 You got a great attitude, Bob
label1 Real credit to the force, you are
label1 Eileen's at home waitin' for you
label1 Heck, Bob...  maybe you are right
label1 I'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense
label1 [grunts]  to end a partnership
label1 Hell of a way to start my retirement
label1 Nancy Callahan, age 11
label1 a very good girl, Nancy
label1 You've been very quiet
label1 We're gonna be taking you home soon
label1 But first, we're going to introduce you to somebody
label1 where Weevil said they took her,  and it hits
label1 Wicked spot of indigestion
label1 [groaning]  At least that's what I pray it is
label1 The briefest indulgement in automotive pleasure
label1 Such shortlived durability, Mr. Shlubb
label1 You would risk engenderating ill will on the part of our employers
label1 This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet,  remanded to our custody, though it may be,  remains the property of the son of Senator Roark
label1 Take 'em down fast
label1 A dent, the merest scratch thereupon,  and beforementioned consequences which I made mention  shall surely be athwart us
label1 [heart beating]  [groans]  Give your heart time to slow down
label1 But it won't slow down
label1 She needs you
label1 We're all done here, Benny
label1 Let's give them some time together
label1 Give them some privacy
label1 I'm making sure they get along really well
label1 What kind of beast couldn't get along with a precious little girl like this
label1 But you've got nothing to be scared of
label1 All we're gonna do is have a nice little talk
label1 That's all
label1 Just a nice talk
label1 Just you and me
label1 it'd be like this
label1 Just take the pill he gave you
label1 No need to play it quiet
label1 Breathe steady, old man
label1 Prove you're not completely useless
label1 What the hell
label1 He likes to hear 'em scream
label1 I've seen his victims and their twisted little faces,  all widemouthed and bugeyed, frozen in their last horrible moment of living
label1 No screams
label1 Either I'm just in time, or I'm way too late
label1 a flesh wound
label1 On your feet, old man
label1 Let the girl go
label1 You know who I am
label1 You know who my father is
label1 You can't touch me, you pieceofshit cop
label1 Look at you
label1 You can't even lift that cannon you're carrying
label1 I don't want you watching this
label1 I mean it, baby
label1 Cover your eyes right now
label1 [Hartigan] I take his weapons away
label1 [screaming]   Both of them
label1 [screaming]    to end a partnership
label1 don't make it any worse
label1 Don't make me kill you
label1 Never better
label1 [Roark groaning]  I'm ready to kick your ass
label1 Just a few more minutes
label1 Sit down and stay down
label1 I'll kill you if I have to
label1 Can't kill her once backup gets here
label1 Run home, Nancy
label1 Run for your life
label1 Hey
label1 Don't listen to him
label1 What a tough man you are
label1 You stay right where you're at
label1 You shoot your partner in the back...  then you try to scare a girl
label1 Maybe I'll pull my spare rod,  plug you a couple of times, show you how it's done
label1 We could've worked something out
label1 Sit down or I'll blast you in half
label1 Sit down
label1 You'll never be able to stop me
label1 The sirens are close now
label1 She'll be safe
label1 I don't mind much
label1 Getting sleepy
label1 It's OK.  She'll be safe
label1 An old man dies,  a little girl lives
label1 Fair trade
label1 Just tell me it isn't true, John
label1 What they're saying about you and that child
label1 If you ever want to see me again...  say something now
label1 We're looking at your basic mountain of DNA evidence
label1 The testimony of your own partner,  corroboration by six eyewitnesses, and that's just so far  and there's your own silence
label1 I'll do what I can, but let us just say you are good and screwed
label1 What's shuttin' you up
label1 This whole thing stinks to high heaven
label1 I'm not the only one on the force who smells it
label1 That's my job
label1 But don't expect any friendly chitchat out of me, mister
label1 I heard what you done to that girl
label1 Evenin', officer
label1 I don't have to introduce myself, do I
label1 You read the papers
label1 This being an election year, you've seen plenty of my picture
label1 And I'm doin' you, Hartigan
label1 Cold and hard, I'm doing you
label1 You blew my son's ear off
label1 You blew his arm off
label1 You even blew his nuts and his pecker off
label1 He's in a coma right now
label1 My boy
label1 He could've been the first Roark to become the president  but you went and turned him into a braindamaged, dickless freak
label1 Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful
label1 Power don't come from a badge or a gun
label1 Lying big, and gettin' the whole damn world to play along with you
label1 There's what, maybe 500 people in this hospital
label1 I could pump you full of bullets right now, and I wouldn't even be arrested
label1 Everyone would lie for me, everyone who counts
label1 Otherwise, their lies, everything that runs Sin City,  it all comes tumbling down like a pack of cards
label1 But I want you firm and fit and healthy
label1 I'm even putting up cash of my own to get you more surgery
label1 Fix that heart condition of yours
label1 You're gonna keep on living a long time
label1 You're gonna be convicted of raping that little brat, and shooting my boy
label1 You're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison,  disgraced, destroyed...  alone
label1 You tell her the truth and she's dead
label1 You tell anybody the truth and they're dead
label1 They won't let me testify
label1 I told the cops that you saved my life and they just acted like I was crazy
label1 They talked my parents into keeping me away
label1 I told them you saved me from that Roark creep,  but they won't even check me out to see that I'm still a virgin
label1 I'm still a virgin, still alive, thanks to you
label1 They got it all backwards
label1 But you'll always remember things right
label1 That's gonna mean a lot to me
label1 But stay away, Nancy
label1 They'll kill you if you don't stay away
label1 Don't visit me
label1 Don't write me
label1 Maybe you won't let me visit, but I'll still write to you, Hartigan
label1 I'll sign my letters "Cordelia.
label1 That's the name of a really cool detective in books I read
label1 I'll write you every week... for forever
label1 Now, run on home
label1 It's not safe for you here
label1 Bye, Nancy
label1 [groans]  John Hartigan
label1 Mr. Law and Order
label1 Mr. By the Book
label1 Mr. High and Mighty
label1 It's catching up with you now, friend of mine
label1 It's catching up with you but good
label1 He doesn't look good
label1 Oh
label1 He's hale and hearty, Tammy
label1 See
label1 [laughing]  That Tammy, there, she's fine, isn't she
label1 I rented her out of Old Town
label1 I wanted to show you what you won't be getting any of, not in prison
label1 You hear me, Hartigan
label1 If you stop being stupid, start playing along with us,  you might just get some of Tammy
label1 You see that
label1 You make her sick
label1 She heard about you and that little girl
label1 I promised myself I'd pay,  and I'm paying it
label1 You don't save a little girl's life,  then turn around and throw her to the dogs
label1 Not in my book, you don't
label1 There was a letter from Nancy waiting when they put me in solitary
label1 She calls herself "Cordelia," just like she promised
label1 She makes no mention of anything that would give her away
label1 At first, I figure she'll send another note or two  before her young mind moves on to better things
label1 But every Thursday, another one arrives
label1 What a sweet kid
label1 I do my best to keep my hand from shaking when I reach for it
label1 She's the only friend I've got, the daughter I never had
label1 Eight years pass
label1 Then comes a Thursday when I bound from my cot,  excited as a kid at Christmas,  only to find myself staring at the damn floor of my damn cell,  looking for a letter from Nancy that isn't there
label1 Then another Thursday with no letter
label1 Is she all right
label1 Nothing
label1 Two months now
label1 Not a word from Nancy
label1 Did they find her
label1 Did they get to her
label1 Of course
label1 Stupid old man
label1 Do your math
label1 How long did you expect her to keep writing
label1 She was a saint to keep it up as long as she did
label1 You're alone
label1 You're all alone
label1 This guy smells awful, like bad food
label1 Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster in the middle of summer
label1 Practically knocked my head off, the bastard
label1 When I come to, I see it
label1 The same kind of envelope Nancy always uses,  but there's no letter inside of it
label1 There's something soft, something that ought to be alive,  a hunk of meat and bone that ought to be the index finger  of the right hand of a 19yearold girl
label1 She was so careful
label1 She never gave away where she lives or where she works
label1 I've got to help her
label1 Nothing else matters
label1 Not my life and not my pride, either
label1 It's only one final surrender they want
label1 You beat me
label1 [phone ringing]  [sirens wailing]  I'll get it, Claire
label1 It's gotta be Marv
label1 He never sleeps and he's always getting himself in deep
label1 Yeah
label1 Hartigan, my God, it is you
label1 Yes, yes
label1 No, I'll get right on it, right this second
label1 I'll be there by ten, I promise
label1 She almost slugged me when I stopped her from hiring a new attorney
label1 When I refused to plead innocent she did slug me
label1 When she hears what I'm gonna do she'll probably slug me again
label1 Hartigan
label1 It's like they were waiting for my call
label1 They're ready to deal
label1 They're practically begging for a deal
label1 One of them promised me you'd be out on parole  if you confessed and expressed regret and all that other dumb crap  that, of course, we won't go for
label1 Then, we're gonna turn right around and sue those sorry sons of bitches  for false prosecution
label1 You're gonna be exonerated
label1 You're gonna be a very rich man
label1 This isn't like you think it is
label1 Like hell it isn't
label1 Doesn't take a genius to figure out who framed you
label1 But even Senator Roark...  You hung up the phone too soon
label1 He will never know what hit him
label1 I'm gonna confess
label1 Excuse me
label1 John Hartigan, crawling on his belly in front of a parole board,  confessing to raping a little girl and blubbering for mercy
label1 No, doesn't work
label1 I'm agreeing to anything they want from me
label1 All right, you son of a bitch
label1 Let's get this over with
label1 hear, just the way they want to hear it
label1 I tell them I'm a twisted, wretched child molester
label1 I agree to everything they want from me
label1 I love you, Nancy
label1 You care for a ride
label1 Long as you stay in front of me
label1 Prison's made you paranoid
label1 Talk about water under the bridge
label1 Yeah
label1 Eight years
label1 Well, if it's any consolation to you...  you made me hate myself
label1 Any word from Eileen
label1 Yeah
label1 She got remarried four years ago
label1 I'm sorry, John
label1 Nah
label1 I'm glad
label1 Eileen always wanted kids
label1 She'll make a good mother
label1 Like you said, Bob, water under the bridge
label1 with fond farewells to each other,  then I go looking for the only human being who means a damn to me:  Nancy
label1 How did they find out who you are
label1 And what have they done to you, baby
label1 Not a sound
label1 No sign of life
label1 Has Roark gone to all this trouble just to torture a broken old man,  like a kid poking at a fly when he's already torn his wings off
label1 What has he done to Nancy
label1 No diary, no phone numbers or addresses written down anywhere
label1 Closest thing to a clue is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon
label1 It's a long shot, but maybe she's got some friends there
label1 A dead end
label1 But if there's anything to be found, the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is  or who kidnapped and mutilated her, this is the place
label1 Wondering if you could help me
label1 I'm looking for somebody
label1 Cold night like this, everybody's looking for somebody, stranger
label1 It's not like that
label1 Eyes to the stage, pilgrim
label1 She's just warming up
label1 She grew up
label1 She filled out
label1 Nancy Callahan, 19 years old
label1 And here I was, expecting a skinny little bookworm,  maybe a bit too shy for her own good
label1 How little she told me about herself in all her letters for all those years
label1 How the hell did they find her
label1 They were bluffing
label1 I've /ed them straight to her
label1 She hasn't spotted you yet
label1 Turn around and walk out the door
label1 Get that Beretta away from him somehow, and kill him
label1 Just a few seconds and she'll be safe
label1 No, Nancy
label1 Don't notice me
label1 Don't recognize me
label1 There's no time to explain
label1 I've made a terrible mistake, put you in terrible danger
label1 Whatever you say, Hartigan
label1 Let me throw some clothes on
label1 And here I'd figured you'd forgotten all about me
label1 Kept me going
label1 Kept me from killing myself
label1 Hurry up, will you
label1 Maybe I should drive
label1 Not a chance
label1 Besides, from the sound of things, you might have to shoot somebody
label1 I don't have a gun
label1 Under the seat
label1 It's loaded and it works
label1 Yeah, this'll do
label1 Kicks like a mule
label1 You've never been far from my thoughts
label1 I've lain awake nights, thinking of you
label1 What are you talking about
label1 Keep driving, Nancy
label1 Keep driving and keep the car on the road
label1 What are you doing
label1 Prove you're still worth a damn
label1 Try to keep it on the road, Nancy
label1 He's got skill, but he's in too much of a hurry
label1 Throwing away bullets like they were candy
label1 Aim careful and look the devil in the eye
label1 Ah
label1 Stop the car, Nancy
label1 What
label1 Stop the car, now
label1 Right
label1 Stop the car, confirm the kill
label1 Sorry
label1 I got a little rattled
label1 Sit tight
label1 No
label1 Let me stay close
label1 Nothing can happen to me when I'm with you
label1 Please
label1 Let me stay close
label1 His blood smells worse than he does
label1 Jesus
label1 But the creep himself, he's gone
label1 I used to welcome the sound
label1 Nothing to do now but find a place for the night,  get Nancy calmed down, and figure out what on Earth I'm going to do next
label1 The stink... somehow it stays with us all the way to the motel
label1 Nancy, I went to your apartment
label1 Your window was thrown wide open
label1 The rooms looked almost empty
label1 My window
label1 Robbed again
label1 That's the third time this year
label1 But there I was, just like before, scared and helpless
label1 I'm such an asshole
label1 You should sit down
label1 better if you sit down
label1 When it comes to reassuring a traumatized 19yearold,  I'm as expert as a palsy victim doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench
label1 It's always been you, Hartigan
label1 It's just nerves making you say that, Nancy
label1 You're just exhausted
label1 You need to sleep
label1 Sleep with me
label1 Stop it, Nancy
label1 Why do you think I kept writing you those letters
label1 It wasn't just gratitude
label1 I tried to fall in love with boys
label1 Even thought I did once or twice
label1 But I was already in love... with you
label1 No
label1 There's wrong and there's wrong and then there's this
label1 I love you
label1 I love you, too
label1 With all my heart
label1 Recognize my voice, Hartigan
label1 I look different, but I bet you can recognize my voice
label1 Sure
label1 I recognize your voice, Junior
label1 Everything's gone straight to hell
label1 Suckered by a spoiled brat son of a senator
label1 It's all gone to hell
label1 I got a dead man needs to be fetched
label1 I want you to set me up for a party
label1 I've already got the girl, you dumb shit
label1 Hey, it better be perfect or I'm calling my dad
label1 It better be ready
label1 It better be perfect
label1 I get to do whatever I want, however I want, whenever I want it
label1 My dad..
label1 He spent a fortune hiring every expert on the planet  to grow back that equipment you blew off between my legs,  just so the old fart can hold out some kind of hope of having a grand kid
label1 Although, as you can see, there were some side effects
label1 I'm not complaining
label1 Since you've been gone, I'm having the time of my life
label1 We wondered who wrote those letters
label1 She left not a clue
label1 Clever girl
label1 And so pretty, so pretty
label1 Nancy, don't scream
label1 Whatever he does to you, don't scream
label1 I'm gonna take all night doing dear old Nancy
label1 And you're gonna die knowing that it's all your fault
label1 They've all screamed, Hartigan
label1 Dozens of them, maybe a hundred
label1 Eight years' worth
label1 Every one of them has screamed
label1 If there weren't so many people hereabout,  I would show you how I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream
label1 It's gonna be one hell of a show
label1 No hope left
label1 No chance
label1 This is it
label1 No
label1 Keep your neck tight
label1 Move
label1 The window, maybe there's an alarm
label1 The window
label1 Keep your neck tight, goddamn it
label1 Stay conscious
label1 No alarm
label1 The glass
label1 Cut the rope
label1 You can do it
label1 to comment with marked displeasure on your rash impulsiveness  in selecting such an eyecatching and impractical car  to heist, Mr. Shlubb
label1 Protest though you might, Mr. Klump,  you must nonetheless admit to the sheer phallic majesty  of said Ferrari's performance
label1 Irrelevant to said mission is the following query,  which I now put forth to you:  Wherein this most streamlined  and trunkless of transports,  bonerinspiring though it may be,  wherein are we to reposit our recently deceased cargo
label1 A worthy concern
label1 Neatly elucidated
label1 I can only express puzzlement that borders on alarm
label1 Tell me where Roark takes the girls or I'll cut your damn head off
label1 In plain English, creep
label1 The answer you seek is rural, even agrarian
label1 The farm
label1 Shlubb and Klump were packing an arsenal
label1 But at first, I'll have to play it quiet
label1 Quiet and nasty
label1 Nancy's car, six miles from the farm
label1 Good girl
label1 The car stalled out on that yellow bastard  and you didn't tell him how to start it up again
label1 You kept your mouth shut
label1 I'll bet Junior was furious
label1 But you stayed strong
label1 You bought a few extra minutes
label1 There's still a chance, Nancy
label1 Don't scream
label1 I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm  and make my way through the woods
label1 I'm not halfway there when it hits
label1 Bad cough
label1 Blood in it
label1 Doesn't matter now
label1 I don't have to stay alive that much longer, anyway
label1 Rotten way to kill a man, but it's quiet
label1 you stupid cow
label1 Is that it
label1 Do you think I'm getting tired
label1 You're the one who's gonna crack
label1 You'll crack
label1 You'll cry and beg
label1 You'll scream
label1 Oh, yeah, you'll scream, you big, fat, ugly cow
label1 You'll scream
label1 That was foreplay
label1 Hartigan was right about you
label1 You're pathetic
label1 You're pathetic
label1 It's not wise at all to make fun of me like that
label1 It brings out the worst in me
label1 In too much of a hurry
label1 It can't be
label1 just like I told myself I wouldn't
label1 Stupid old man
label1 [man] You tagged him good
label1 [man 2] Perforate the fool
label1 It's over
label1 Let her go
label1 You're dreaming, Hartigan
label1 I see your eyes while I fillet the woman of your dreams in front of you
label1 You're about to keel over
label1 Sure, I can
label1 You gave me a scare there for a second there, old man
label1 Nancy, I'm sorry
label1 First I soften you up, and then it's showtime
label1 Here it comes
label1 It's gonna hurt
label1 You're right about that.  
label1 [gasping] ' [sighs]  Sucker
label1 [screaming]  Eight long years, son of a bitch
label1 is pounding wet chunks of bone  into the floorboards, so I stop
label1 So long, Junior
label1 Been a pleasure
label1 I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once
label1 I know it, baby
label1 You grew up strong
label1 to the car, Nancy stops shaking
label1 Her skin is warm again
label1 Thanks for remembering my coat
label1 And for all the little things
label1 Like saving my life, twice
label1 You're not coming along
label1 No
label1 I have friends on their way, to collect evidence
label1 I'm gonna blow this whole sick mess wide open
label1 I'm gonna clear my name
label1 I'm gonna put Senator Roark behind bars where he belongs
label1 You'll never lose me, Nancy
label1 Shame to lie to her
label1 I hope she forgives me for it
label1 Get Senator Roark behind bars
label1 Sure
label1 There isn't a prosecutor in the state who'll go after Senator Roark
label1 I killed his only son
label1 The bloodline is cut
label1 Roark's lost his goddamn legacy
label1 He'll use all his power to get revenge on me
label1 He'll go after me through Nancy
label1 He'll find her again
label1 There 'll be no end to it
label1 Not as long as I'm alive
label1 There's only one way to beat him
label1 An old man dies,  a young woman lives
label1 Fair trade
label1 like the last leaf on a dying tree
label1 I let her hear my footsteps
label1 She only goes stiff for a moment
label1 Sure
label1 Are you as bored by that crowd as I am
label1 I didn't come here for the party
label1 I came here for you
label1 I've watched you for days
label1 You're everything a man could ever want
label1 It's not just your face,  your figure or your voice
label1 It's your eyes
label1 What is it you see in my eyes
label1 I see a crazy calm
label1 You're sick of running
label1 You're ready to face what you have to face
label1 No
label1 I don't want to face it alone
label1 She's soft and warm and almost weightless
label1 I tell her that everything will be all right
label1 That I'll save her from whatever she's scared of and take her far, far away
label1 I tell her I love her
label1 I hold her close until she's gone
label1 I'll never know what she was running from
label1 I'll cash her check in the morning
label1 It's not the city
label1 I could've gotten in a traffic accident anywhere
label1 Yeah, just a fracture
label1 The doctor said it's a clean break
label1 It should be right as rain in no time
label1 Uhhuh
label1 Mmhmm
label1 and you can find... anything
label1 Care for a smoke
label1 Love you, too, Mom
label1 It's a lousy room in a lousy pan' of a lousy town
label1 I'm staring at a goddess
label1 I'm not gonna waste one more second wondering how I've gotten so lucky
label1 like angels ought to smell
label1 The perfect woman
label1 The goddess
label1 I need you
label1 She says her name is Goldie
label1 And that cold thing happens to my stomach
label1 And I realize Goldie's dead
label1 Not a mark on her
label1 She was murdered and I was right here when it happened
label1 Lying next to her, stone drunk, just like she was
label1 Damn it, Goldie
label1 Who were you and who wanted you dead
label1 Who were you besides an angel of mercy,  giving a twotime loser like me the night of his life
label1 It sure as hell wasn't my looks
label1 So why the sleazy saloon
label1 too much, showing up before anybody  but me and the killer could know there's been a murder
label1 No reason at all to play it quiet
label1 No reason to play it any way but my way
label1 Whoever killed you is gonna pay, Goldie
label1 I'll be right out
label1 I don't know why and I don't know how I never even met you before tonight,  but you were a friend and more when I needed one
label1 And when I find out who did it,  it won't be quick and quiet like it was with you
label1 It'll be loud and nasty, my kind of kill
label1 I love you, Goldie
label1 [siren blares in distance]  [helicopter passing]   Claire
label1 Now, don't worry, Lucille
label1 I was just grazed
label1 No way I'm giving you any alcohol
label1 Besides, it's not what you came here for anyway, is it
label1 No
label1 Go ahead
label1 You're worse without 'em
label1 You're the best
label1 She's a dyke, but God knows why
label1 With that body of hers she could have any man she wants
label1 She tried to analyze me once but she got too scared
label1 Haven't seen you like this in a while
label1 Got in a fight with some cops
label1 Didn't happen to kill any of them
label1 Not that I know
label1 But they know they've been in a fight, that's for damn sure
label1 There ain't no squaring it
label1 Not this time
label1 Or some creep with a gas can trying to torch someone
label1 Hey, hey
label1 This is big
label1 Settle down, Marv
label1 Take another pill
label1 There ain't no settlin' down
label1 This is the old days and the bad days, the allornothing days
label1 They're back
label1 And I'm ready for war
label1 Prison was hell for you
label1 It's gonna be life this time
label1 Hell's waking up every goddamn day and not even knowing why you're here
label1 But I'm out now
label1 It took somebody who was kind to me getting killed to do it
label1 I know exactly what I gotta do
label1 [helicopter passing]  [Marv] Now, for Gladys
label1 Sweet Gladys
label1 Mom still hasn't changed a thing in this room
label1 Every week she dusts it all off so it looks like it was only yesterday  that I moved out
label1 Every time I come visit, she has me sleep in here,  and the old smells make me cry like they do right now
label1 I knew Gladys would be safe here
label1 I call her Gladys after one of the sisters from school
label1 She's almost lived up to the name
label1 Good as ever
label1 I tell her about Goldie and what we have to do
label1 Marvin
label1 Yes, Mom
label1 I'm sorry I woke you up
label1 There were men here looking for you
label1 They weren't police
label1 It was about my job
label1 I got a new job
label1 It's night work
label1 What did you do to your face
label1 You're getting confused again, aren't you
label1 Mom, I feel better than I have in years
label1 weren't you, Goldie
label1 Somebody wanted you dead and you knew it
label1 So you hit the saloons, the bad places,  looking for the biggest, meanest lug around and finding me
label1 Walk down the right back alley in Sin City...   Leave your hands off Nancy
label1 ...and you could find anything
label1 That coat looks like Baghdad
label1 Take off
label1 He's new here, Marv
label1 He didn't know
label1 Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy,  shoulder to shoulder with all the other losers like me
label1 But that's not what I'm lookin' for tonight
label1 I'm looking for something small and hairy
label1 Take it easy, Weevil
label1 It's money in your pocket
label1 Spread the word
label1 Tell him I've been hitting the joints drunk off my butt,  shooting my mouth off, crying over some hot babe named Goldie
label1 A shot and a brew, Shellie, and keep 'em comin'
label1 Sure, honey
label1 You take it slow, now
label1 He just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century
label1 He'd be right at home on some ancient battlefield,  swinging an ax into somebody's face
label1 Or in a Roman arena taking a sword to other gladiators like him
label1 They'd have tossed him girls like Nancy back then
label1 Drink up
label1 That's one finelooking coat you're wearing there
label1 Your killin' days are over, you overthehill, dogooder son of a bitch
label1 you do to them, you don't feel bad
label1 What
label1 A fine coat, you're bleeding all over it
label1 All right, it's all yours
label1 Oh, God
label1 The guy who did that, he knew what he was doing
label1 So tell me, man
label1 I don't hear you giving me any names
label1 So I guess when I shot you in the belly I aimed a little too high
label1 [screams]  [gunshot]  and I'm gonna have to get really nasty
label1 It was Telly... Telly Stern passed me the order
label1 He runs the tables over to the Triple Ace Club
label1 Thanks again
label1 damnedest thing happens
label1 Just need my medicine, is all
label1 Bastard
label1 You're gonna pay for what you did to me
label1 Feel like talking, Louie
label1 It was Connelly
label1 He set me up
label1 He'll never talk
label1 I don't know about you, but I'm havin' a ball
label1 I don't want to keep you up all night,  so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch
label1 These here hands of mine, they got blood all over 'em
label1 You're speaking figuratively
label1 When I need to find something out, I just go out and look for somebody  that knows more than me, and I go and I ask them
label1 Sometimes, I ask pretty hard
label1 Tortured 'em first
label1 You might say I been working my way up the food chain
label1 First two were minnows, smalltime messengers
label1 But it was Connelly, the money man, who fingered you, Padre
label1 Dear Lord, man, this is a house of God
label1 Just give me a damn name
label1 You really are pushing your luck,  feeding me garbage like that
label1 It can't be that big
label1 There's a farm at North Cross and Lennox
label1 Find out for yourself
label1 And while you're at it,  ask yourself if that corpse of a slut is worth dying for
label1 Worth killing for
label1 Amen
label1 His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes,  or at least that's what they're passing off as a Mercedes these days
label1 Modern cars: they all look like electric shavers
label1 [grunts]  Goldie
label1 [grunts]  It couldn't be Goldie
label1 It's my own fault, and nobody else 's, that I got confused
label1 I've been having so much fun I forgot to take my medicine
label1 That wasn't Goldie back there
label1 Goldie's dead,  and that's the whole reason that I've been doing what I've been doing
label1 When you got a condition, it's bad to forget your medicine
label1 The cold thing,  it creeps into my gut and tells me one more time it won't let go
label1 [barking, growling]  I don't want to fight, pooch
label1 I got no gripe with you
label1 Easy, boy
label1 my gun on you, buddy
label1 So I sniff around to see what's buried
label1 Here we go
label1 It's impossible
label1 Nobody can sneak up on me
label1 Not a sound
label1 Nobody's that quiet
label1 Except the one who snuck into that hotel room two nights ago
label1 It was you, you bastard
label1 You killed her
label1 It was... [grunts]   I found your killer, but he was better than me
label1 Too quiet, too quick
label1 A killer born
label1 Why didn't he finish the job
label1 He keeps the heads
label1 He eats the rest
label1 It's not just that wolf of his
label1 The wolf just gets scraps
label1 Bones
label1 He... eats... people
label1 He cooks them like they were steaks
label1 Let's get you warm
label1 Just like they were steaks
label1 Now he's got both of us
label1 It's all right
label1 Just look at the heads on the wall
label1 The heads on the wall
label1 Son of a bitch
label1 He kept smiling that damned smile
label1 He made me watch him suck the meat off my fingers
label1 Oh, Jesus
label1 Christ, I could use a cigarette
label1 gotta do is let it out
label1 And a few buckets later, there's no way you'd know
label1 Whoever's behind this whole thing has his connections right in the department
label1 Any leads
label1 One guy I talked to told me it was Roark running the show
label1 Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out that hooker almost before I did
label1 The one you've been obsessing over
label1 The dead one
label1 Goldie
label1 I didn't know she was a hooker
label1 Doesn't make any difference about anything
label1 She was highclass stuff
label1 Must have shown you quite a time
label1 There's a car coming
label1 [horn honks]  [man] Kevin
label1 and a name
label1 I'll see you later, Kevin
label1 They're done checking the house
label1 They're coming this way
label1 Bastards
label1 I'll show them.  
label1 No, don't shoot
label1 Please
label1 Listen to me
label1 I'm his parole officer
label1 Captain, the target, there's no sign of him
label1 Here's a sign
label1 [screaming]   That there is one damn fine coat you're wearing
label1 I was pretty steamed about what he'd done to Lucille,  so I took my time with that son of a bitch
label1 Just a name: Patrick Henry Roark, man of the cloth
label1 Could've become president, but he chose to serve God
label1 Along the way, he happened to become the most powerful man in the state
label1 He's brought down mayors and governors like they were nothing
label1 He even made his rotten brother a US senator without breaking a sweat
label1 I'm getting used to the idea
label1 More and more, I'm liking the sound of it
label1 Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts
label1 I've got a condition
label1 I get confused sometimes
label1 And with Lucille dead, I can't get my medicine
label1 What if I've imagined all of this
label1 What if I've turned into what they've always said I was gonna turn into
label1 A maniac
label1 Can't kill a man without knowing for sure you ought to
label1 I've gotta know for sure
label1 The merchandise is on display by the time I make my way to Old Town
label1 For an hour or so, I ask around about Goldie
label1 I don't get any answers, but I know I'm bound to
label1 You can't be Goldie
label1 Goldie's dead
label1 I haven't eaten anything or taken my medicine for days now
label1 Bastard
label1 He's crazy
label1 Hit him again, Wendy
label1 Harder
label1 Wait a minute
label1 Why did she call you Wendy
label1 My twin sister
label1 I guess she was the nice one
label1 Goldie and the other six, where are they
label1 What did you do to them
label1 You crazy goddamn broad
label1 Just take a look at this mug
label1 None of you would, but Goldie
label1 And she only did because she thought I could protect her
label1 But as soon as they had me for a fall guy, they showed up, guns blazing
label1 But they didn't get me, and I've been killing my way to the truth ever since
label1 So, go ahead, doll
label1 Shoot me now, or get the hell out of my way
label1 OK, I'm glad we got all that sorted out
label1 What the hell
label1 I tied those knots
label1 That's my specialty
label1 Well, sure
label1 I thought I might be able to talk some sense into you
label1 And I probably would have had to paste you one,  and I don't hurt girls
label1 I need a pair of handcuffs
label1 I got a collection
label1 Just give him the ones you got with you, Gail
label1 It was a farm boy named Kevin who killed Goldie,  but it was Cardinal Roark who was behind it, and I don't know why
label1 I know that sounds crazy
label1 No, it doesn't
label1 Goldie worked the clergy
label1 a puzzle piece falls smack in my lap
label1 And suddenly, my heart's pounding so loud I can't hear anything else
label1 I want to reach over and touch her and taste Goldie's sweat one more time
label1 But she isn't Goldie
label1 the old home security, huh
label1 so I'm in this one to the end
label1 Why are you willing to go up against Roark for someone you barely knew
label1 She was nice to me, gave me something I didn't even know existed
label1 I wasn't never even able to buy a woman
label1 You know, the way I look
label1 It's almost killing time, and I'd better get sharp
label1 I check the list: rubber tubing, gas, saw,  gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet,  Gladys and my mitts
label1 We're close enough
label1 Pull over
label1 Keep the engine runnin'
label1 If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get the hell outta here and don't look back
label1 Kill him for me, Marv
label1 I won't let you down, Goldie
label1 Getting himself a midnight snack, and I can guess what kind
label1 Come on, you son of a bitch
label1 Is that the best you can do, creep
label1 That's right
label1 Get personal, get close
label1 I can take it
label1 I got you, you little bastard
label1 Let's see you hop around now
label1 My muscles make me a thousand promises of pain to come
label1 Let me do it, Marv
label1 Let me finish him
label1 You wasn't supposed to come down here, Wendy
label1 Oh, but I want to..
label1 It'll give you nightmares
label1 I'm good and bushed
label1 And it's not that fight of ours that did me in, either
label1 It's all that sawing and tying
label1 It's not as easy as it looks
label1 Could have been a real mess around here  if I didn't have that tubing for tourniquets
label1 I gotta admit, there was a spurt or two,  to get the scent in the air, to get that friend of yours to come running
label1 Look who's here
label1 Here he comes
label1 [growling]  That's a good dog
label1 Somehow the bastard is still alive, still staring at me
label1 Not even when I grab the saw and finish the job
label1 He never screams
label1 I put in a call to Kadie 's and ask Nancy to get her clothes on  and meet me at her place
label1 She says, "Yes," like always
label1 Sure, Marv
label1 There isn't much of anything Nancy wouldn't do for me
label1 Not since a year back when a frat boy roughed her up  and I straightened him out but good
label1 It really gets my goat when guys rough up dames
label1 What do you want me to do with her
label1 Well, your best bet is drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks
label1 Are you leaving town
label1 Hell, no
label1 I like it here
label1 and stay under the speed limit  so as not to get any attention
label1 My head starts to clear
label1 Things start to make sense
label1 I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up
label1 So, if going after Roark means dying, win or lose,  hell, I'll die laughing if I know I've done this one thing right
label1 Quiet as a grave out here
label1 Kevin
label1 What's left of him, anyways
label1 Oh, my God
label1 You monster
label1 You demon
label1 He had the voice of an angel, yet he spoke only to me
label1 And he's dead now because of one stupid whore
label1 It's not a real good idea for you to talk about Goldie  that way while I'm around
label1 When he came to me...  he was a tormented boy
label1 Tormented by guilt
label1 I tried to counsel him
label1 But the eating, it filled him with white light
label1 Tearful, he swore to me that he felt the touch of God Almighty
label1 I know it's pretty damn weird to eat people
label1 And I joined in
label1 They were all whores
label1 Nobody cared for them
label1 Nobody missed them
label1 She stayed in public places
label1 And then with you
label1 You were so convenient
label1 You'd broke a man's jaw that very night
label1 Kevin killed her
label1 I ordered the police in for you, but you wouldn't be caught
label1 You wouldn't stop
label1 And now he's dead and you're here to...  eliminate me
label1 Will that give you satisfaction, my son
label1 Killing a helpless old fart
label1 The killing, no
label1 Kevin...  we're going home
label1 You can scream now if you want to
label1 It's just like I promised, only better
label1 And when his eyes go dead, the hell I sent him to  must seem like heaven after what I've done to him.  
label1 [man] Freeze
label1 [man 2] Oh, my God
label1 [heart monitor beeping]  [Marv groans] Jerks
label1 They should've shot me in the head, and enough times to make sure
label1 Everybody knows what's coming, but they go through the motions anyway
label1 What a waste of time
label1 Months fall off the calendar while I breathe and eat through tubes
label1 After a while, I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that
label1 I'm on my feet for ten minutes  before the cops kick them out from under me
label1 They just keep knocking the crap out of me and waving a confession in my face
label1 And I keep spitting blood all over it  and laughing at how many fresh copies they come up with
label1 Then along comes this worm assistant district attorney  who turns the recorder off and says if I don't sign their confession,  they'll kill my mom
label1 I break his arm in three places and I sign it
label1 From then on, it's the circus everybody wants it to be
label1 The judge is all fire and brimstone when she hands down the sentence
label1 Midnight and my death are only a few hours away,  when I get my first surprise in 18 months
label1 My only visitor
label1 I'm ready for anything but that scent
label1 Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy
label1 I..
label1 I got confused again
label1 Just seeing you like this
label1 like angels ought to smell
label1 The perfect woman
label1 Goldie
label1 She says her name is Goldie
label1 They fix me a pretty decent steak for my last meal
label1 They even throw in a brew
label1 It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's
label1 Then they shave my head and fix me with a rubber diaper and get to it
label1 And it's about damned time, if you ask me
label1 "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow..."  Would you get a move on
label1 You heard the man
label1 Is that the best you can do, you pansies
label1 He's gone
label1 Forget it, man
label1 You can bang on that door all night if you want to
label1 you're doing this to me, Shellie
label1 Everything we've shared..
label1 It has to mean something to you
label1 Plenty of lost pay on account of how nobody wants  to flirt with a waitress whose face is all purple and swollen up with bruises
label1 I know you're angry, baby
label1 I forgive you for that without you asking me to
label1 There's a difference between getting honked off at a guy who's not so bad,  and finding out that you've been sweettalked by a total jerk loser  who skips out on a wife he doesn't even tell you about  every time he gets drunk, which is way too often
label1 That hurt, Shellie
label1 It's one thing for you to play hard to get,  but don't go trying to cut my nuts off
label1 I am impossible to get
label1 Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy, and get help,  like... a shrink
label1 Get help and get lost
label1 Go ahead and open the door, Shellie
label1 Just open the door and you'll see how wrong you've been about me
label1 Oblige him, Shellie
label1 I'm ready for him
label1 No
label1 If he knew that you were here with me,   you don't know how bad this could get
label1 This clown's got a big, mean drunk on
label1 Hey, I could swear I heard somebody in there with you just now
label1 Somebody
label1 Jackie Boy, it's a regular African love fest in here
label1 I mean, I got me all five starters,  half the bench of the Basin City Blues keeping me company
label1 You feel like taking them on
label1 Some of my best friends..
label1 But you're really pushing my buttons
label1 And the whole time you've been doing me like this,  I've been too polite to point out that any time I want to,  I could kick this damn door to splinters
label1 You know what I can do
label1 One, two...  All right, then
label1 All right
label1 Troops, make yourself at home
label1 You brought your whole pack with you
label1 You're gonna love this, baby
label1 Call up some of your friends who work the saloon
label1 With you and the bunch of us, we're gonna hit every joint in town,   and it's gonna be great
label1 I ain't calling up nobody
label1 You got somebody's love stink all over you
label1 You've been with another man and you've been with him tonight
label1 Who is he
label1 He's Superman
label1 [Jackie Boy chuckling]  I have no feelings at all
label1 just go ahead and get it over with, you sick bastard
label1 lying about me again,  right in front of my friends
label1 I have never hit a woman in my life
label1 That's showing her, man
label1 You goddamn coward
label1 Baby, we're here to have a good time
label1 Yeah
label1 I gotta take a leak
label1 Then you could've met my boyfriend
label1 Could've seen what a real man looks like
label1 There you go, after my nuts again
label1 But I forgive you
label1 He is generous
label1 But that temper of his...  You never should have picked on him like you did
label1 My temper you don't have to worry about
label1 Shut up and keep your hands to yourself or I'll cut your little pecker off
label1 Oh, you don't wanna be hitting the streets dressed like that
label1 It's a jungle out there
label1 Hey, baby, I don't hear you making those calls
label1 Answer me
label1 Oh, I don't need this grief
label1 Hi
label1 You ever so much as talk to Shellie again, you even think her name,  and I'll cut you in ways that'll make you useless to a woman
label1 You're making a big mistake, man
label1 A big mistake
label1 Yeah
label1 You already made a big mistake yourself
label1 You didn't flush
label1 Troops, get outta here
label1 No questions
label1 Now
label1 I don't think he'll be bothering you again
label1 How's your jaw
label1 I've been slapped around worse
label1 And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him
label1 And it was only once
label1 I've done some dumb things
label1 Seeing how I'm one of those dumb things,  I can't give you too hard a time about that
label1 But this guy, he's a menace
label1 He might kill somebody if I don't stop him
label1 I'll call you later
label1 I can't make out  over the racket of a passing police 'copter
label1 Stop
label1 It sounds like "stop,"  but I can't be sure
label1 They're a pack of predators and they're out for blood tonight: a woman's blood
label1 Damn it, Dwight
label1 Damn it
label1 You fool
label1 You damned fool
label1 I'm speeding
label1 That's a good way to get yourself noticed
label1 If you're a murderer with a new face who's one fingerprint check away  from the fast track to the gas chamber like I am,  the last thing you want is to get noticed
label1 I don't have nearly enough cash on me to bribe this cop, and even if I did,  there's the outside chance he's one of the honest ones
label1 Do I try to talk my way out of this, or do I take this cop down and risk it all
label1 Watch it, Jack
label1 [horn honking]   [tires screeching]  [siren wailing]  Cops
label1 They're right on our ass
label1 Not where we're headed
label1 Jackie Boy's leading us straight to Old Town
label1 The cop shuts off his siren
label1 The ladies are the law here, beautiful and merciless
label1 If you've got cash and play by the rules,  they'll make all your dreams come true
label1 Squad car's long gone
label1 I called it
label1 Was I right
label1 You're always right, Jack
label1 None of us ever doubted you for a second
label1 But I heard things about these girls
label1 Who's out of line
label1 Ha
label1 Hey, baby
label1 Hey, baby
label1 Hop in, sugar
label1 Aw, sweetheart, I work the day shift and it's been a long day
label1 Get in the car, baby
label1 We'll just talk
label1 It'll be nice
label1 I don't do talk jobs, either
label1 I've been beat up every time I turn around
label1 But the day I get turned down by a hooker  when I got good, hardearned cash to pay her with,  well, there's only so much a man can take
label1 Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street
label1 That's the Alamo, not the Amigo
label1 The Amigo's a fag joint
label1 a good time humiliating me like this  for no damn reason at all
label1 That's far enough, Dwight
label1 We've been on top of these peckervvoods  since they showed up with that cop behind them
label1 Enjoy the show
label1 The ladies are their own enforcers
label1 How's the barmaid
label1 You know, the one that never shuts up
label1 Not right now, Gail
label1 Ooh
label1 Wound up a little tight, aren't we
label1 That's your whole problem, Dwight
label1 That, and your lousy taste in women
label1 These days, anyway
label1 Damn it, Gail
label1 Those clowns down the way, they some of the barmaid's boyfriends
label1 One of them thinks he is
label1 I followed them here to make sure he didn't hurt any of the girls
label1 Us helpless little girls
label1 to hit less than 20 yards ahead of us,  and still it's hard to take my eyes off her
label1 Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot
label1 Those boys in that Chrysler are one mistake away  from seeing what Miho can do
label1 to the pixie perched on the roof's edge
label1 Deadly little Miho
label1 [girl] You're running out of alley
label1 Turn around
label1 a sassy little thing
label1 You ain't hardly in any kind of position to be making threats
label1 locked and ready to spring
label1 So what
label1 They deserve what's coming
label1 So why this rotten feeling in my gut that something is awfully wrong
label1 They haven't killed anybody I know about
label1 It got pretty bad at Shellie's place, but they didn't kill anybody
label1 Something Shellie said
label1 I can't place it
label1 OK, OK, OK
label1 I sounded off a little more than I should have
label1 Over the edge
label1 It's not a woman you need
label1 You couldn't handle a woman, the state you're in
label1 She's saying you ain't got what it takes, Jack
label1 You wanna see it
label1 You wanna see what I got
label1 Huh
label1 I've seen all shapes, all sizes
label1 You seen this one
label1 Oh, sugar, you just gone and done the dumbest thing in your whole life
label1 This is crazy
label1 Out of nowhere, for no reason at all
label1 Go ahead
label1 Go ahead
label1 Go ahead
label1 He's got the drop on her
label1 He's dead
label1 He's just too damn dumb to know it
label1 I got you right where I want you
label1 This is a careerending wound, whore
label1 And there's gonna be hell to pay
label1 Watch your step, Jackie Boy
label1 This isn't funny
label1 Don't anyone laugh
label1 Every one of you is gonna burn
label1 You're only making it worse
label1 You shut the hell up
label1 Don't pull the trigger
label1 It'll backfire
label1 I told you to shut up
label1 I can't see
label1 What's happening
label1 I can't hear anything
label1 For God's sake, Miho, finish him
label1 Yeah
label1 Make it quick, will you
label1 quite chop his head off
label1 Then it's straight to business:  Stretching corpses out on the floor and going through their pockets,  divvying up cash when they find it
label1 His wallet is packed
label1 MasterCard, Discover, Platinum American Express,  and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties  that I'm not too proud to stuff into my own pockets
label1 Then I find an atom bomb
label1 Jackie Boy,  you son of a bitch
label1 There was a helicopter that kicked up such a racket,  I couldn't quite make out what she said
label1 I thought Shellie said "stop.
label1 She said "cop.
label1 Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty
label1 A goddamn hero cop
label1 It's held for years, the shaky truce
label1 The cops get a slice of the profits  and free entertainment when they throw a party
label1 The girls administer their own brand of justice
label1 If a cop blunders into the neighborhood  and he's not shopping for what the girls are selling, they send him packing,  but they send him back alive
label1 That's the rules
label1 That's the truce
label1 The cops stay out
label1 Old Town will be left wide open
label1 It'll be war
label1 Women's blood
label1 The cops
label1 The mob
label1 Things are gonna go back to the way they used to be
label1 The hell they will
label1 We got guns
label1 We'll go to war
label1 [Dwight] Don't be stupid
label1 You wouldn't stand a chance
label1 Get me a car
label1 Did you forget that cop car that trailed them here
label1 The cops know Rafferty came here
label1 They'll check the river, they'll check the sewer
label1 They'll find him and come gunning for us
label1 The cops won't check
label1 Get that out of my face or I'll smack ya
label1 Who do you think you are, giving orders
label1 You got what you wanted out of us
label1 Shut up, Gail
label1 You got what you wanted out of me
label1 Gone until you brought this unholy mess on us
label1 One word from Gail and she'll cut me in half
label1 They'll be watching the roads
label1 It'll be the bad old days all over again
label1 The pimps, the beatings, the drugs, the rapes
label1 They won't be watching the roads
label1 Get me a damn hardtop
label1 If I don't make it, you can have your war
label1 Get that gun out of my face now
label1 Ah
label1 Bastard
label1 I forgot how quick you are
label1 An explosion that blasts away the dull, gray years  between the now and that one fiery night when she was mine
label1 A hardtop with a decent engine
label1 And make sure it's got a big trunk
label1 I'll always love you, baby
label1 Just look at that trunk
label1 We'll never fit 'em all in
label1 Gail
label1 Um, unless there's something else you want me to do,  you think maybe I could go home
label1 All this blood and stuffs got me feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl
label1 But don't you talk to anybody, not even your mom
label1 They'll never fit in that trunk
label1 Not like this, they won't
label1 Miho
label1 Dry your hair as soon as you get home
label1 Yeesh
label1 Hey, Becky
label1 Gail said no calls
label1 I won't tell her nothing
label1 Please, don't say nothing to Gail
label1 Hey, Mom
label1 What were they thinking,  sticking me with a beatup bucket of bolts like this
label1 There wasn't anything we could do but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me,  out where anybody who cares to look will see him
label1 Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes
label1 It'll help
label1 It's got you smoking there, bud
label1 You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy
label1 I'm just imagining this, so shut the hell up
label1 It's got you hearing things
label1 It's got your nerves shot
label1 It's got you smoking
label1 You know it's true
label1 [wheezing]  Nobody ever really quits
label1 And your chips are down
label1 I'm fine
label1 You shut the hell up
label1 Will you look at that
label1 Ooh
label1 Those hookers let you down
label1 You sucker for the babes, you
label1 You ain't even gonna make it to the pits
label1 You shut the hell up
label1 I'll make it
label1 Ah, this is great
label1 Just like being in a buddy movie
label1 Shut up
label1 _ [Jackie Boy laughing]   Boy, you're screwed, you're out, you're finished
label1 Stick a fork in it
label1 You're swirling around the bottom of the bowl,  nosediving down the pipe
label1 It's over
label1 to tell him to shut up
label1 Sure, he's an asshole
label1 Sure, he's dead
label1 Sure, I'm just imagining that he's talking
label1 I don't have a chance in hell of outrunning this cop
label1 Not in this heap
label1 Pull over
label1 The only question left is whether I'm gonna kill him or not
label1 For all I know, he's an honest cop, regular guy,  a working stiff with a mortgage, a wife and a pile of kids
label1 My hand moves all on its own,  sliding one of my guns to my lap and thumbing back the hammer
label1 Better stop
label1 You're making him mad
label1 Whatever you say
label1 Your friend here... party a little too hard tonight
label1 I'm the designated driver
label1 I'll let you off with a warning
label1 What next
label1 a quarter mile from the pits
label1 I shove the TBird the rest of the way
label1 A few minutes' more work and it'll all be over
label1 Do what I say
label1 Clear the streets
label1 We're not selling any tail in Old Town
label1 Not tonight
label1 Don't struggle
label1 You'll only hurt yourself
label1 Your cause is lost
label1 We know everything
label1 There'll be arrests
label1 There'll be deaths
label1 My employer will seize what remains of this neighborhood
label1 Nothing can stop this
label1 But it is within your power to save many lives  by facilitating the process of transition,  by negotiating the terms of the surrender of Old Town
label1 Son of a bitch
label1 I have suffered your kind before, the dregs of Sin City
label1 I serve a new master now,  and soon you and all your wretched kind will serve him as well
label1 Now, get dressed and shed a tear for Dwight McCarthy if you must,  because, by now, he is surely dead
label1 You don't know him
label1 My man will find a way
label1 He always finds a way
label1 This is a fine, grand country
label1 Low taxes, land of opportunity
label1 Where else would one bullet buy us the fortune that we're getting for this
label1 airports and churches  without shite to show for it
label1 Yeesh
label1 You find something, Murphy
label1 Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge
label1 What's this stuck in it
label1 Bloody hell
label1 It's the bullet
label1 You son of a bitch
label1 Bastard
label1 If they were hired by who I think they were,  the bad times haven't even started yet
label1 And everything seemed to be going so well
label1 Ronnie
label1 Lend me your knife
label1 Should I take a nap while I'm doing all this waiting
label1 I'm at the bone, all right
label1 There we go
label1 Have you ever seen anything so pretty in your whole life
label1 We'll be back for the three of you, and if anyone happens by,  use your imagination, OK
label1 Only the horrid, oily tar taste creeping up my nostrils
label1 Let it fill your lungs
label1 They were counting on you and you blew it
label1 Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist
label1 Miho, you're an angel
label1 You're a saint
label1 You're Mother Teresa
label1 You're God
label1 If you'd shown up ten minutes earlier, we'd still have Jackie Boy's head
label1 Dwight, they got Gail
label1 You got yourselves a spy in Old Town
label1 A stoolie who sold you out to the mob
label1 We gotta find out who it is and rescue Gail
label1 First, we gotta get Jackie Boy's head  before it gets to wherever it's going and this situation blows wide open
label1 I'm not fooling around
label1 We talk
label1 Stay smart
label1 Stay cool
label1 It's time to prove to your friends that you're worth a damn
label1 Sometimes, it means killing a whole lot of people
label1 There they are
label1 We stop 'em, Dallas
label1 is close to me  I could almost reach out and grab it right then and there
label1 Get the head
label1 Get the head
label1 I got it
label1 Suck on this, you stupid slag
label1 if Miho is alive or dead,  but I'm on my feet and every ounce of me wants to get some killing done
label1 So come down and get it
label1 I could've put a bullet straight down your ear just now,  if I hadn't got me revolver all wet and useless
label1 You got the drop on me, love
label1 I got to come clean with you, sweetheart
label1 You see, I'm not too fond of shootin'
label1 It's my preference to blow things up
label1 Once you blast the roof off a pub  and seen all the parts flying off people,  a little bang bang's never gonna match the sight of that
label1 Here's me, with all these fine grenades and such a sweet beauty of a remote
label1 But it's me knife I'll be doing you with
label1 You killed me mates
label1 Someone shoulda told ya: never give an Irishman good cause for revenge
label1 You won't feel a thing unless she wants you to
label1 [crunching]  He feels it
label1 I grab poor Dallas's earphone and make the most important call of my life
label1 First, we gotta rescue Gail, then comes the kill
label1 The big, fat kill
label1 _ [gasping]  [crunching]  Do we just gotta stand here and watch this
label1 I could watch old Manute do his thing all night and not get tired of it
label1 I mean, the man's an artist
label1 Only an artist should be allowed to touch such a beautiful subject
label1 Your skin is perfect
label1 Beautiful
label1 Just give them what they want, Gail
label1 Becky
label1 There's no fighting them
label1 Dwight's dead
label1 They got what's left of that cop we killed
label1 Mob's gonna turn it over to the chief, cops'll mow us down
label1 We gotta cut a deal
label1 You little bitch
label1 I didn't have no choice
label1 They was gonna hurt my mom
label1 You gotta out a deal with these people
label1 It's selfish, you holding out like this
label1 You'll get a lot of girls killed for no good reason
label1 We could have protected her and you know it
label1 It was the money, you stupid little bitch
label1 Sure, there's money
label1 Sure, you could've moved my mom into Old Town  and let her know that her daughter's a goddamn whore
label1 They offered me what you couldn't never offer me: a way out
label1 I had to watch out for my own neck
label1 Your neck
label1 You're crazy
label1 You could have ripped my throat out, you crazy whore
label1 Schutz, fetch my blades
label1 Stuka, kill this one
label1 Stupid little bitch
label1 You deserve worse
label1 I knew there was a reason I got out of bed this morning
label1 Hey
label1 Hey
label1 I don't see nobody
label1 It's right through me
label1 Guys, look
label1 There's something wrapped around it
label1 Some kind of note
label1 [Manute] Give it to me
label1 It's poked right through me
label1 It's starting to hurt
label1 Out back
label1 Everyone
label1 Bring the women
label1 Do you think somebody should call me a doctor or something
label1 Hey
label1 Guys
label1 Oh...   armed to the teeth
label1 I'm outnumbered, outgunned
label1 They can't surround me
label1 Sometimes, you can beat the odds with the careful choice of where to fight
label1 Just give me the woman
label1 [muffled talking]  Shut up
label1 Dwight, don't do this
label1 Wait a minute
label1 Something's not right
label1 Shut up, or I'll plug you
label1 A fair trade
label1 She's all yours
label1 Now, if you'll explain to me why we shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...  Dwight, what have you done
label1 Exactly what I had to
label1 No
label1 It isn't right
label1 There wasn't no tape over his mouth
label1 How come there's tape over his mouth
label1 counts for a lot
label1 But there's nothing like having your friends show up with lots of guns
label1 No
label1 McCarthy, you shit
label1 The girls all know the score
label1 We gotta kill every last rat bastard one of 'em
label1 Not for revenge, not because they deserve it,  not because it'll make the world a better place
label1 We need a heap of bloody bodies  so when mob boss Wallenquist looks over his charts of profits and losses,  he'll see what it cost him to mess with the girls of Old Town
label1 They run out back
label1 Right on schedule
label1 She gets her practice in
label1 The Valkyrie at my side is shouting and laughing  with the pure, hateful, bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,  and so am I
label1 The fire, baby
label1 It'll burn us both
label1 There's no place in this world for our kind of fire,  my warrior woman, my Valkyrie
label1 You'll always be mine
label1 Always... and never.﻿1 Chapter one last stage to red rock  got room for one more

label1 No one said the job was suppose to be easy
label1 No one said it was suppose to be that hard, nether
label1 But that little lady,  is why they call him "the hangman"
label1 When the handbill says dead or alive, the rest of  us shoot ya' in the back from up on top of a perch  somewhere, bring ya' in dead over a saddle
label1 When the hangman catches you... You hang
label1 You overrate 'em nigger
label1 I'll give you he got guts
label1 Now Daisy,  I want us to work out a signal system of communication
label1 When I elbow you real hard in the face...  That means: Shut up
label1 You got it
label1 I got it
label1 I..
label1 I know we only met each other once before
label1 And I don't mean to unduly imply intimacy
label1 But...  Well...  You still got it
label1 Of course
label1 Do you got it on you
label1 Where
label1 Right here
label1 I can imagine you probably don't like to take  it in an'out of the envelope all that often
label1 But if you wouldn't mind,  I'd sure appreciate seein' that again
label1 You right,  I don't like taking it in an'out of the envelope that much
label1 Yeah
label1 "Ole Mary Todd's callin', so I guess it must be time for bed"  ole Mary Todd
label1 That gets me
label1 That gets me too
label1 You know what this is, tramp
label1 It's a letter from Lincoln
label1 It's a letter from Lincoln to him
label1 They shared a correspondence during the war
label1 This is just one of the letters
label1 What the...  O.B
label1 Stop
label1 Of all the stupid,  like to rip my goddamn arm off
label1 I didn't,  drag her stikin' ass up this goddamn mountain, just  for you to break her neck on the ouskirts of town
label1 You the one handed her my goddamn letter
label1 I didn't give it to her, I gave it to you
label1 You ruin that letter of his,  that niggers gonna' stomp your ass to death
label1 And when he do,  I'm gonna sit back on that wagon wheel watch and laugh
label1 She didn't help it none
label1 But it's alright
label1 Is that the way niggers treat their ladies
label1 You... ain't no goddamn... lady
label1 Hey mister Ruth
label1 There's another fella' on foot, up here on the road
label1 What
label1 I said, there's another fella' on foot, up here on the road
label1 Considering there's a blizzard goin' on,  whole lotta' fellas walkin' around, wouldn't you say, major
label1 Considerin I'm one half of them fellas, yeah..
label1 Seems to be a lot of 'em
label1 Eight thousand dollars a lotta' money for a nigger
label1 You really think I'm in cahoots wit' that fella'
label1 Or her
label1 Put them on
label1 I ain't wearin' handcuffs
label1 You put those on or you can stop worryin' about this whole thing, right now
label1 Little jumpy, ain't you
label1 Never mind the jokes, just do it
label1 If you say so
label1 I do
label1 Okay..
label1 O.B.
label1 Ya' got 'em
label1 I got 'em
label1 Okay fella',  you keep holdin' that lantern in that one hand,  and you keep that other hand where I can see it
label1 Walk over there where I can get a good look at cha'
label1 I'll be a goddamn dog in the manger
label1 I'm sorry friend, do we know each other
label1 Not quite
label1 You know this fella'
label1 Like I said friend,  you got me at a bit of a disadvantage
label1 Keepin' you at a disadvantage, is a advantage I intend to keep
label1 Whoever you are mister,  you sure sound tough when you're talkin' to a desperate man knee deep in snow
label1 I don't want no trouble
label1 I'm freezin to death
label1 Who is this joker
label1 You heard of the rebel renegade erskine mannix
label1 That's them
label1 The scourge of south Carolina, mannix marauders
label1 That's erskine's youngest boy, Chris
label1 Well Mr. face,  I was riding to red rock and my horse stepped in a gopher hole in the snow,  fucked up his leg, an' had to put 'er down
label1 You got business in red rock
label1 Yes I do
label1 What
label1 I'm the new sheriff
label1 Horseshit
label1 'Fraid not
label1 Once I get there they swear me in, but that ain't happened yet
label1 And that's when you get your star
label1 You got anything that can back any of this up
label1 Yeah
label1 When we get to red rock
label1 And I figure you're taking them three dead bodies into red rock to get paid
label1 Three dead
label1 One alive
label1 Who's that
label1 Who the fuck is Daisy domergue
label1 Not a goddamn thing to nobody, except me and the hangman
label1 The hangman
label1 You're the hangman, Bob Ruth
label1 It's John
label1 And you..
label1 Your're the nigger with the head...  Major marquis
label1 My lord, is that really the real head of major marquis, lookin' at me now
label1 What's goin' on, y'all havin' a bounty hunters picnic
label1 Never mind, you takin' in them three dead bodies  and her to red rock to get paid, ain't ya'
label1 Yeah
label1 Well..
label1 The man is red rock suppose to pay you is me
label1 The new sherrif
label1 So if you wanna get paid, you need to get me to red rock
label1 So I'm suppose to freeze death, 'cause you find something hard to belive
label1 Put them on and come inside
label1 No
label1 Then you'll freeze
label1 Then you'll hang
label1 How so
label1 Driver
label1 I gotta hold these horses I can hear you just fine from up here
label1 You heard me tell this fella' I'm the new sheriff of red rock, right
label1 Red rock is my town
label1 And I'm gonna' enter my town in bounty hunters chains
label1 No sir
label1 Sorry bushwackers, I ain't entering red rock that way
label1 When you finally get to red rock, you're going  to realize every goddamn thing I said was right
label1 And I expect you, o.B.,  to tell the townsfolk of red rock that John  Ruth, let their new sheriff freeze to death
label1 You let me die, that's murder
label1 Hold out your hands
label1 O.B
label1 Give the major back his iron
label1 One thing I know for sure,  this niggerhatin' son of a gun ain't partnered up with you
label1 I'll help protect your eight thousand,  you help me protect my ten,  deal
label1 Ain't love grand
label1 Tell ya' what, Bob  the name's John
label1 When we get to red rock, I'll buy you and major marquis there dinner and booze
label1 May way of sayin' thanks
label1 Well Mr. Ruth,  you sound like you got a axe to grind against the cause
label1 The cause of a renegade army
label1 A bunch of losers gone loco, you bet I do
label1 And this should interest you Warren, imparticular emancipated blacks
label1 Sounds like my kinda' fella'
label1 Sounds to me you been readin' a lotta' newspapers printed in Washington D.C.  Anywho, I'm just tryin' to let y'all know grateful I am
label1 I was a goner, and y'all saved me
label1 Shut up
label1 God damnit, Daisy it's comin'
label1 Here, last piece
label1 Does he know how famous you once was
label1 Black eye
label1 Do you know who he is
label1 Do I know about the thirty thousand dollar reward  the confederacy put on the head of major marquis
label1 Yeah
label1 Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting,  but they never did get 'em the right nigger head, did they
label1 No they didn't
label1 But it wasn't for lack of tryin'
label1 Them peckawoods left their homes and their families, and come to this snowy mountain,  lookin' for me and fortune
label1 The ones you ain't ever heard of no more,  they found me
label1 Once passions had colled, it dropped down to eight, then five
label1 But, I bet even when it was five thousand,  you had your share of country boys comin' to call
label1 You know I did
label1 The confederates took exception to my capacity for killing them
label1 After I broke out of wellenbeck,  the south took my continued existence as a personal affront
label1 So the cause put a reward on my head
label1 What's...  Wellenbeck
label1 No reb, I ain't never heard of it
label1 You bust out
label1 Maj. Marquis did more than bust out
label1 Maj. Marquis had a bright idea
label1 So bright...  You got to wonder, why nobody never thought about it before
label1 Tell John Ruth about your bright idea
label1 Well the whole damn place was just made out of kindling
label1 There was a rookie regiment spendin' the overnight in that camp
label1 Fortyseven men... Burnt to a crisp
label1 I'm suppose to apologize for killin' Johnny reb
label1 You joined the war to keep niggers in chains
label1 I joined the war to kill white Southern  crackers and that means kill 'em anyway I can
label1 Shoot 'em
label1 Stab 'em
label1 Drown 'em
label1 Burn 'em
label1 Whatever it took to put white Southern crackers in the ground  that's what I joined the war to do, and that's what I did
label1 To answer your question, John Ruth,  when major marquis burned forty seven men alive,  for no more a reason then to give a nigger a run for the trees,  that's when the south put a reward on the head of major marquis
label1 And you best belive I ain't look back till I crossed the northern line
label1 But you had a surprise waitin' for you on the northern side, didn't ya'
label1 See once they started pullin' out all the burnt bodies at wellenbeck,  seems not all of them boys were rebs
label1 You burnt up some of your own boys, didn't ya' major
label1 How many burnt prisoners they end up findin'
label1 That's the thing about war mannix,  people die
label1 So ya' chalkin' it up to "war is hell", ha
label1 Well admittedly that's a hard argument to argue with
label1 I think they thought, thirtyseven white men for one nigger  wasn't so hot a trade
label1 I belive they accused you  of being a kill crazy nigger who only joined the war to kill white folks  and the whole blue and grey of it all didn't really much matter to ya'
label1 And that's why they drummed your black ass outta'  the cavalry with a yellow stripe down your back
label1 Isn't it major
label1 Horse shit
label1 I didn't say they could prove it
label1 But they sure did think it out loud, didn't they major
label1 But,  Warren's war record was stellar, and that's what saved his ass
label1 Are you killed yourself your share of  redskins in your day, didn't ya' black major
label1 I'll tell a' what the cavalry didn't look kindly on
label1 Mannix's marauders that's what
label1 And the fact that erskine mannix's little boy  would talk about anybody else's behavior  during war time makes me wanna horse laugh
label1 We weren't foreign barbatians pounding on the city walls
label1 We were your brothers
label1 We deserved dignity in defeat
label1 Just,  how many nigger towns did y'all sack in your fight for dignity in defeat
label1 My faire share, black major
label1 'Cuz when niggers are scared, that's when white folks are safe
label1 No no no, you got me talkin' politics  I didn't wanna'
label1 I..
label1 I think I'll just look out this winda'  let this beatuiful carriage rock me to sleep
label1 And dream about how lucky I am
label1 Easy
label1 What the hell's going on,  we weren't expecting another stage tonight
label1 I can see you already got another one up in here
label1 I just got through putting the horses away
label1 This ain't the normal line
label1 Are minnie and sweet Dave inside
label1 They ain't here
label1 I'm running the place while they're gone
label1 Where's minnie and sweet Dave
label1 He says they ain't here
label1 Who are you
label1 I'm Bob
label1 Well whoever you are, help o.B
label1 With the horses
label1 I just put those other horses away
label1 You need it done fast, you need to help
label1 I got two of my best men on it
label1 Come on let's go
label1 Open up
label1 Kick it open
label1 What
label1 Kick it open
label1 Shut that door, there's a goddamn blizzard out there
label1 You have to nail it shut
label1 There's a hammer and nails by the door
label1 You have to nail it shut
label1 There's a hammer and nails by the door
label1 Give me a hammer
label1 Yeah
label1 You need to do two pieces of wood
label1 Two pieces of wood
label1 That fuckin' thing is busted
label1 Not just one piece of wood
label1 Yeah, allright
label1 Gimme the nail
label1 Here
label1 Jesus
label1 That door's a son of a gun
label1 Good heavens,  a woman  out in this white hell
label1 You must be frozen solid, poor thing
label1 Looks like minnie's got her a full house
label1 About forty minutes ago
label1 The cowboy fella' in the courner, is that your driver
label1 No he's a passenger
label1 The driver lit out
label1 He said he was going to  spend the blizzard shacked up with a friend
label1 Jesus Christ, that's awful
label1 Christ almighty, what that Mexican fella' do, soak his ole socks in the pot
label1 He don't have that problem
label1 
label1 Over there
label1 So,  all three of you fellas' headed to red rock, when the blizzard stopped ya', huh
label1 Yes, all three of us were on that stagecouch out there
label1 Over there
label1 Get your hand outta' there
label1 The new sheriff of red rock is traveling with us
label1 Sheriff of red rock, that'll be the day
label1 If he is a goddamn sheriff, I'm a monkey's uncle
label1 Then you can share bananas with your nigger friend in the stable
label1 So..
label1 The new sheriff of red rock is traveling with you
label1 He's just talkin' his self outta' freezin' to death, is all
label1 What the fuck I tell you about talkin', huh
label1 I'll bust you in the mouth right in front of these people, I don't give a fuck
label1 You never gave your name, sir
label1 John Ruth
label1 Are you a lawman
label1 I'm takin' her to the law
label1 That's right, Buster
label1 Do you have a warrant
label1 'Course I do
label1 May I see it
label1 How am I suppose to know,  you're not a villain,  kidnapping this woman without a warrant in your possession
label1 What's your name, Buster
label1 Well..
label1 It certainly isn't Buster
label1 It's oswaldo mobray
label1 Oswaldo
label1 Yes
label1 Well..
label1 I take it you're Daisy domergue
label1 Yeah it's her
label1 It says here, dead or alive
label1 Yeah it does
label1 Wouldn't transporting her be easier  if she were dead
label1 No one said the job was suppose to be easy
label1 Let's just say I don't like to cheat the hangman
label1 He's gotta' make a living too
label1 Well I appreciate that
label1 Allow me to properly introduce myself
label1 I'm oswaldo mobray,  the hangman in these parts
label1 So it would appear
label1 Have you ever spent two days or more locked up with one of your customers
label1 No I can't say I have
label1 Don't talk to my prisoner
label1 I talk to my prisoner, that's it
label1 I got I got
label1 Jolly good
label1 You got anything in here besides coffee that can help warm us up
label1 All right
label1 All right
label1 I'll feed and water the horses
label1 You go inside and get some hot coffy
label1 I've got some stew cooking
label1 Now look...  Now matter how bad this blizzard gets,  we still gotta' feed these horses and take a squat from time to time
label1 So me an' Chris better lay out a line  from the stable to the front door, and from the front door to the shithouse
label1 Okay
label1 Good idea
label1 Come on, Chris
label1 No no no, go inside, get warm
label1 You're doing stable work in a goddamn blizzard, I offer to help and you say no
label1 You're right, mi amigo
label1 All right, follow me
label1 We gonna' drop one, every ten paces
label1 From here to the door
label1 Yeah
label1 All right
label1 Now, you're wanted for murder
label1 For the sake of my analogy, let's just assume that you did it
label1 John Ruth wants to take you back to red rock to stand trail for murder
label1 And as the hangman,  I will perform the execution
label1 And if all those things end up taking place,  that's what civilized society calls "justice"
label1 However,  if the relatives and the loved ones of the person  you murdered were outside that door right now
label1 Now the good part  about frontier justice is it's very thirst quenching
label1 Not in your case
label1 In your case, you'd have it  comin'
label1 But other people, maybe not so much
label1 But ultimately what's the real difference between the two
label1 The real difference is me..
label1 The hangman
label1 To me, it dosen't matter what you did
label1 When I hang you, I  will get no satisfaction from your death
label1 The man who pulls the lever,  that breaks your neck will be a dispassionate man
label1 And that dispassion is the very essence of  justice
label1 For justice delivered without dispassion,  is always in danger of not being justice
label1 Amen
label1 No offense cowboy fella', just gettin' your attention
label1 What'cha writing firend
label1 Only thing I'm qualified to write about
label1 What's that
label1 My life story
label1 You're writing your life story
label1 You bet I am
label1 You just entered
label1 Well you like writing stories so much, why don't  you tell me the story that brings you here
label1 Who's askin'
label1 John Ruth
label1 I'm bringin' in this one to red rock to hang
label1 Ain't no way I'm spendin' a coupla' nights under a  roof with somebody I don't know who you they are
label1 So...  Who are you
label1 Joe gage
label1 What
label1 That's my name, Joe gage
label1 Okay Joe gage, why you goin' to red rock
label1 I ain't goin' to red rock
label1 Where you goin'
label1 What's there
label1 Your mother
label1 Listen, I'm just a cow puncher I just..
label1 I got back from a long drive and..
label1 I wasn't just an ass in a saddle this time,  I was a partner
label1 Now that's funny
label1 'Cuz you don't look like the coming home for Christmas type
label1 Yeah, well...  You know, looks can be deceiving
label1 Because I definitely am a...  Coming home for Christmas to spend time with mother type
label1 Christmas with mother
label1 It's a wonderful thing
label1 Now is that... good enough for you
label1 John Ruth
label1 For now
label1 Just steer clear of my prisoner
label1 Hello old timer
label1 General
label1 You sir,  are a hyena
label1 And I have no wish to speak to you
label1 Fair enough, general
label1 Sorry to bother you
label1 You gonna' kick it open
label1 Kick it open
label1 It dosen't have latch you gonna' hammer up a board
label1 You gotta' nail it shut
label1 The hammer and nails is by the door
label1 Oh god,   holdin' this Chris
label1 Here, here
label1 You need to nail it in
label1 You need two pieces of wood
label1 You gotta' hammer another one
label1 One ain't good enough
label1 It's gotta' open if you don't
label1 Shut up
label1 I got it
label1 Son of a bitch
label1 Jesis Christ, that door's a whore
label1 I get it, haberdashery,  that was a joke
label1 How's the coffy
label1 Now, pretty good, if I do say so myself
label1 Guess who he is
label1 Buffalo bill
label1 Hardly, no
label1 I'm oswaldo mobray, I'm the  he's the hangman of red rock
label1 Well good to meet you Mr.
label1 Mobray
label1 Mobray, I'm Chris mannix,   the new sheriff in red rock
label1 Really
label1 Pay no attention to him
label1 Horseshit
label1 Fella' warmin' himself by the that pot by the stove is a hell of driver named o.B
label1 That's the only thing you said that's the truth
label1 Precisely
label1 Do you have the execution orders on you
label1 In my beg
label1 May I see 'em
label1 Of course
label1 Who's Lance Lawson
label1 He's a fell' been sittin' in the red rock jail about a month now
label1 He's the fella  who shot the fella'  who was sheriff 'fore me
label1 What did she mean when she said,  bounty hunter's nigger friend in the stable
label1 He's got a nigger bounty hunter firend in the stable
label1 I don't think that was the original idea, but...  That's the idea now
label1 Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy
label1 Five of you
label1 Well, well, well, looks like minnie's haberdashery  is about to get cozy for the next few days
label1 Yes it does
label1 Who's the chap with the Lincoln letter
label1 The Lincoln what
label1 President Abraham Lincoln
label1 Weren't you pen pals
label1 With the president
label1 I'm sorry, I heard somebody in your party had a  letter from Abraham Lincoln, I assumed it was you
label1 The black fella' in the stable
label1 The nigger in the stable has a letter from Abraham Lincoln
label1 Yeah
label1 The nigger in the stable has a letter from Abraham Lincoln
label1 Bob
label1 Warren
label1 Minnie and sweet Dave in there
label1 Minnie and sweet Dave went to visit her mother on the north side of the mountain
label1 What
label1 Yeah
label1 Yes, they're visiting her mother
label1 Her mother
label1 I never knew minnie had a mother
label1 Everybody's got a mother
label1 Yeah, I suppose
label1 And she left you in charge
label1 Si
label1 Are you callin' me a liar
label1 Not yet, I ain't
label1 Well first of, minnie never struck me as the sentimental type
label1 Secondly,  I can't imagine sweet Dave liftin' his fat ass  outta' his chair long enough to fetch well water,  unless minnie was layin' a fryin' pan upside his head
label1 Along takin' trips to the north side
label1 That sounds a whole lot like you're calling me a liar, mi negro amigo
label1 Yeah it do sound a whole lot like, don't it
label1 But I still haven't done it yet
label1 Minnie still serve food
label1 Do you consider stew food
label1 Then we serve food
label1 She still stinkin' up the place with her "old quail" pipe tobacco
label1 Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe
label1 "Red apple tobacco"  but mi negro amigo, I think you already know this
label1 Just seein' if you do
label1 Fill me up, o.B
label1 Yeah
label1 Goddamn it
label1 Thank you
label1 Well cut my legs off and call me shorty...  Is that genaral sanford smithers I see
label1 You've got a good eye son
label1 General Sandy "don't give a damn" smithers
label1 Captain Chris mannix, mannix marauders
label1 Erskine's boy
label1 Yes sir
label1 May I sit down, sir
label1 Genaral Sandy smithers..
label1 Boy...  Oh boy
label1 Did my daddy talk about you
label1 Me and my boys did our part
label1 Just like erskine and his boys did their part
label1 Yankees sons of bitches
label1 I never knew your father, son
label1 But, I always respected his resolve
label1 Thank you for saying that, general
label1 Your respect woulda' meant the world to him
label1 Can I get ya' some coffy
label1 Well, how about a blanked
label1 That would be even nicer
label1 Hell, you know what, you can have mine
label1 So what brings you out Wyoming way, sir
label1 If ya' don't mind me askin'
label1 My boy
label1 You gotta' boy that lives in red rock
label1 Forgive me sir
label1 No forgiveness needed, son
label1 Like I said, it was a few years back
label1 It was after he served his service
label1 He came out here to the hills of Wyoming,  to make his fortune
label1 I bought him a symbolic plot  in the red rock cemetery
label1 I'm here to advise the stone maker on his headstone
label1 Was he a goner fer' sure
label1 It's a rough life, but folks can learn it
label1 If he had done what he came here to do,  he'd a come home
label1 Close it, close it
label1 You have to hold it closed while I nail it shut
label1 Really
label1 Who's the idiot who broke the damn door
label1 Okay
label1 Hold it, mi negro amigo
label1 We need two pieces of wood
label1 Ola mi cabron
label1 That's a lotta' hats, senor Bob
label1 Huh
label1 Which,  if I remember it correctly, that was one of them bar of iron rules,  kinda rule, she'd want kept up in her absence
label1 You seem to have a laissez faire attitude when it comes to the hats
label1 I'm guilty
label1 I have a laissez faire attitude about the hats
label1 How about we forget about the hats today,  considering there's a blizzard going on and all,  and make tomorrow "no hat day"
label1 Labrador
label1 Always said that Davis was a courages man
label1 But he should have put capital in Montgomery and not Richmond
label1 Yes, sir
label1 I agree with that the army in north Virginia would've been used in a..
label1 Shut up
label1 O.B.
label1 Do you know that nigger, sir
label1 I don't know that nigger
label1 And that's all I need to know
label1 Well that nigger just ain't any nigger
label1 That nigger is  general sanford smithers
label1 Battle of Baton Rouge
label1 Major nigger, general smithers wishes me to inform you..
label1 I heard 'em hillbilly
label1 Inform this old cracker that I was in Baton Rouge also
label1 On the other side
label1 General smithers, he said that he was also in Baton Rouge
label1 On the other  cap't mannix, tell the nigger,  that I don't acknowledge niggers in northern uniforms
label1 You captured a whole colored command that day
label1 But not one colored trooper made it to a camp, did they
label1 Nor the inclination to care for northern horses,  and least of all northern niggers
label1 So we shot 'em where they stood
label1 Gentlemen,  gentlemen,  I know Americans aren't apt  to let a little thing like an unconditional surrender get in the way of a good war
label1 But I strongly suggest we don't restage the battle of Baton Rouge,  during a blizzard in minnie's haberdashery
label1 Now, my nubian friend,  while I realize passions are high, that was a while ago
label1 And if you shoot this unarmed old man I guarantee  I will hang you by the neck until you are dead
label1 Once we arrive in red rock
label1 Yeah Warren, that's the problem with old men
label1 You can kick 'em down the stairs and say it's  a accident, but ya' can't just shoot 'em
label1 Gentlemen, since we may be trapped here,  close together like for a few days,  may I suggest a possible solution
label1 We divide minnie's in half
label1 With the dinner table  operating as a neutral territory
label1 We could say that the fireplace side of the room,  acts as a symbolic representative of...  Georgia  while the bar, represents...  Philadelphia
label1 As long aas the bar's Philadelphia I agree
label1 We still got that deal we talked about in the wagon
label1 I help you protect your eight thousand, you help me protect my ten
label1 What is he
label1 He's in cahoots with this one that's what he is
label1 One of them, maybe even two of 'em, is here to see domergue goes free
label1 And to accomplish that goal, they'll kill everbody in here
label1 So all they gotta' do  is sit tight and wait for a winda' of opportunity
label1 And that's when they strike,  huh bitch
label1 If you say so, John
label1 Are you sure you're not just being paranoid
label1 He won't have the leather patience it takes to just sit here and wait
label1 But waiting for an oportunity, and knowing it's the right one, isn't so easy
label1 He'll try and create his opportunity
label1 And that's when mr. Jumpy reveals himself
label1 What do I got to say
label1 About John Ruth's ravings
label1 He's absolutely right
label1 Me and one of them fella's is in cahoots
label1 And  we're just waitin' for everybody go to sleep
label1 That's when we gonna' kill y'all
label1 This here is Daisy domergue
label1 She's wanted dead or alive for murder
label1 Ten thousand dollars
label1 Don't wanna' share it
label1 I ain't gonna' lose it
label1 When the sun comes out, I'm taking this woman into red rock, to hang
label1 Now...  Is there anybody here...  Comitted to stopping me'...  From doing that
label1 Nobody gotta' problem with this
label1 Well, I guess that's very fortunate for me
label1 However, I hope you all understand,  I can't just take your word
label1 Circumstances force me to, take...  Precautions
label1 When you say precautions...  Why do I feel you mean me
label1 You are
label1 Yes I am
label1 Just mine
label1 The hangman got himself a gun too
label1 I'll be dealing with his gun after I deal with yours
label1 I feel kinda' naked without it
label1 Oh, I still got mine
label1 A bastards work is never done, huh, John Ruth
label1 That's right, Joe gage
label1 Now gimmie the gun
label1 You want it
label1 You have to come and take  calm down
label1 Take your hand away from your gun
label1 Did he blink
label1 He blinked
label1 Blink if your gonna' remain calm
label1 He blinked
label1 Take his pistol
label1 Like I said, nothing personal
label1 Pretty sneaky
label1 I'm afraid the same applies to you too, Mr.  Mobray
label1 Precautions must be taken because life is too sweet to lose
label1 Hand me that little bucket
label1 Go to the outhouse
label1 Take this bucket and dump it down the shit hole
label1 Why do I gotta' go outside
label1 Your jacket's already on
label1 And I sorta kinda trust you
label1 After you major
label1 Okay
label1 Don't get any ideas, I ain't goin' soft on ya'
label1 You lift your ass even one inch off this seat,  I'll put a bullet right in your goddamn throat
label1 You don't hear me complaining do ya'
label1 No I sure don't
label1 How about me what
label1 Look,  considerin' all the thing I done for money, I ain't one to judge
label1 But don't you feel just the least little bad 'bout hangin' a woman
label1 Till they invent a trigger a woman can't pull, if  you're a hang man, you're going to hang woman
label1 Well hell ozzy, I guess I ain't never looked at it like that before
label1 When it comes to some of them mean bastards  out therem it's the only thing does the job
label1 You really only need to hang mean bastards
label1 You goddamn son of a bitch
label1 I almost died out there
label1 I ain't never going out in that shit ever, ever again
label1 I'm fine
label1 I'll be fine
label1 I just need to get warm
label1 You want some stew, o.B.
label1 Stew, later
label1 That's nice
label1 Leave me be from your horseshit
label1 John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln letter
label1 I tole' you jackass to heehaw somewhere else
label1 That's right, John
label1 Yeah I did
label1 So...   You got a letter from Abraham Lincoln
label1 Yes
label1 Thee Abraham Lincoln
label1 Yes
label1 Yes
label1 Of America
label1 Yes
label1 Wrote you a letter, personally
label1 Yes
label1 Personally
label1 No
label1 Personally as in: "Dear marquis"
label1 "Dear marquis" Abraham Lincoln the president of the United States of America
label1 May I see it
label1 No you may not
label1 But the way John tells it, you weren't just some  random nigger soldier picked from a pile of letters
label1 Way John tells it,   y'all hada' correspondence
label1 Yes
label1 Way John tells it, y'all's practically pen pals
label1 And a pen pal's..
label1 John Ruth,  you really think a nigger drummed outta' the  calvary with a yellow stripe down his back,  was practically friends with the president of the United States of America
label1 John Ruth, I hate to be the one to break it to ya' but nobody in minnie's haberdashery,  had ever corresponded with Abraham Lincoln,  least of all, that nigger there
label1 Was all that horseshit
label1 Course it was
label1 Well I guess it's true what they say about you people
label1 You can't trust a fuckin' word that comes outta' your mouth
label1 I hurt your feelings
label1 As a matter of fact, you did
label1 But you got no idea, what it's like being a black man facin' down America
label1 The only time black folks are safe,  is when white folks is disarmed
label1 And this letter,  had the desired effect of disarming white folks
label1 Call it what you want,  I call it a dirty fuckin' trick
label1 You wanna' know why I'd lie about something like that, white man
label1 Well I'll tell you like the lord tole' John,  a letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't have that kinda' effect on me
label1 I might let a whore piss on it
label1 I spit on it
label1 Warren goddamit, you leave that old man alone
label1 Stand down you son of a bitch, I shared a battle field with this man
label1 Or would you deny me that too
label1 I suppose you were there
label1 May I join you
label1 Damn it
label1 So,  how's life since the war
label1 Got both my legs
label1 Got both my arms
label1 I can't complain
label1 Got a woman
label1 What was her name
label1 Betsy
label1 Georgia girl
label1 Augusta
label1 I use to raise Kentucky horses
label1 Her paw' was the owner of the breedershit where I brought of my ponies
label1 I made good deal on her
label1 Took the stake he gave and bought a bunch peach ochards
label1 Set myself up pretty well
label1 Did a hellva' lot better than my no good brothers, that's for damn sure
label1 He spoke highly of his mama too
label1 You knew my boy
label1 Yeah...  Yeah I knew 'em
label1 You did not know my boy
label1 Suit yourself
label1 Didja' know my son
label1 No
label1 The day he met me
label1 He came up here to do a little nigger head huntin'
label1 By then the reward was so, five thousand and bragging rights
label1 But back then to battle hard rebs, five thousand just to cut off a niggers head,  now that's good money
label1 So the Johnny's climbed this mountain, lookin' for fortune
label1 But there was no fortune to be found
label1 All they found was me
label1 "If you just let me home to my family, I'll  swear, I'll never set foot in Wyoming again.
label1 That's what they all said
label1 Beggin' for his life
label1 Your boy told me his whole life story
label1 And you was in that story, general
label1 And when I knew me I had the son
label1 Of the bloody nigger killer of Baton Rouge..
label1 I knew me I was gonna' have some fun
label1 General smithers, don't you listen to him, he didn't know your boy
label1 He just heard, tell why you here is all
label1 It was cold the day I killed your boy
label1 And I don't mean snwoy mountain in Wyoming cold
label1 And on that cold day,  with your boy at the business end of my gun barrel..
label1 I made him strip
label1 Then I told him to start walkin'
label1 I walked his naked ass for two hours, 'fore his cold collapsed him
label1 You never even knew my boy
label1 No he didn't
label1 He's just a sneaky nigger tryin' to getcha to go for that gun
label1 Then he commits to begging again
label1 He knew he'd never see his home again
label1 And he wasn't beggin' for his life neither
label1 'Cos he knew that was long gone
label1 Now don't judge your boy too harshly, general
label1 You'd be surprised what a man that cold, would do for a blanket
label1 Wanna know what your boy did
label1 I took my big, black, pecker outta' my pants
label1 And I made him crawl through the snow on all fours over to it
label1 Then I grabbed a hand full of that black hair on the back his head...  Then I stuck my big, black Johnson right down his goddamn throat
label1 And it was fulla' blood, so it was warm
label1 And Chester Charles smithers,  sucked on that warm black dingus for long as he could
label1 Starting to see pictures, ain't ya'
label1 Your boy...  Black dudes dingus in his mouth
label1 Him shakin', him cryin'  me laughin'  and him not understandin'  but you understand, doncha' Sandy
label1 I never did give your boy that blanket
label1 Even after all he did, and he did everything I asked
label1 That blanket was just a heart breakin' liar's promise
label1 Kinda' like those uniforms the union issued those colored troopers,  that you chose not to acknowledge
label1 So what you gonna' do old man
label1 You gonna' spend the next two or three days,  ignore the nigger that killed your boy,  ignoring how I made him suffer
label1 He was your boy
label1 Chapter four domergue's got a secret  about fifteen minutes has passed, since we last left our characters
label1 Joe gag volunteered to take smithers dead body outside
label1 Straws we drawn to see who would help him...  O.B
label1 Lost
label1 Chris, John Ruth and oswaldo,  had vigorous debate about the legality of selfdefense murder they just transpired
label1 Captain Chris mannix dawn the dead generals coat and  joined oswaldo in lighting the candles and lanterns
label1 Hey ozzy, hey you got the right idea
label1 Let's light this place up
label1 To return
label1 Bob enjoyed an manzana roja
label1 Domergue, however,  hasn't moved from her spot at the community dinner table since John Ruth uncuffed her
label1 Can I play that guitar over there
label1 Let's go back a bit
label1 Your boy, black dudes dingus in his mouth
label1 Fifteen minutes ago major Warren shot general smithers in front of everybody
label1 But fourty seconds before that, something equally  as important happened, but not everybody saw it
label1 While major Warren was captivating the crowd  with tales of black dicks and white mouths...  Somebody... poisoned the coffy
label1 He did everything I asked, no blanket
label1 And the only one to see 'em do it...  Was domergue
label1 John Ruth
label1 Yeah
label1 Can I play that guitar over there
label1 Yeah
label1 My pistol plays a tune
label1 Domergues death march, you got it
label1 Yeah, yeah, yeah
label1 That's the one you like to sing in the stagecoach, huh
label1 Yeah
label1 It's kinda' pretty
label1 Got another verse to it
label1 Yeah I got
label1 Music time's over
label1 Turn around
label1 No, no, no, no, no
label1 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up
label1 When you get to hell, John
label1 Tell 'em Daisy sent ya'
label1 Mannix the coffy
label1 Gimme that fucking gun
label1 Don't test me, bitch
label1 Goddammit  get or don't get, Joe gage
label1 It's up to you
label1 I'll get
label1 Then get
label1 Everybody turn around and put your hands on that wall
label1 Move 'em down snowshoes
label1 Everybody keep your mouth shut and do like I say
label1 You open your mouth; You gonna' get a bullet
label1 You move a little sudden, a little strange; You gonna' get a bullet
label1 Not a warning, not a question; A bullet
label1 You got that
label1 "I got it"
label1 "I got it"  "I got it"
label1 We have it
label1 Come on
label1 Take this gun out of my holster
label1 Point it at them
label1 Like I said, anybody does anything
label1 Kill 'em
label1 So...  You finally decided I'm tellin' the truth 'bout bein' the sheriff of red rock, huh
label1 I don't know 'bout all that
label1 But you ain't the killer who poisoned that coffy
label1 But one of 'em is
label1 Gimme the key
label1 You motherfucking black bastard
label1 You're gonna' die on this mountain and I'm gonna' fucking laugh when you do
label1 What I say 'bout talkin
label1 'Meant it, didn't I
label1 And you need to understand, you just killed the only  man here, comitted to gettin' you to red rock alive
label1 Now, one of y'all... Is workin' with her
label1 Or all y'all is..
label1 But only one of you poisoned the coffy
label1 So what charms this bitch got, take a man brave a blizzard,  kill in cold blood, I'm sure I don't know
label1 But o.B
label1 Wasn't hangin' nobody
label1 He damn sure would
label1 But he sure enough led over there dead now, though, ain't he
label1 Just like any one of us who'd drank that coffy
label1 Like me god damnit
label1 Now those of y'all with your hands on the wall  don't practice in poison need to think about that
label1 Think about how that coulda' you been you rollin' around on this floor
label1 And I know who I got my money on
label1 Yeah that's right Joe gage I'm lookin' at you
label1 Not so fast Chris
label1 We'll get there
label1 Let's slow it way down
label1 Who made the coffy
label1 He did
label1 Yeah, he did, didn't he
label1 Yeah, he did, didn't he
label1 But it's the stew that's got me thinking
label1 A week
label1 Si
label1 See, my mama used to make stew
label1 And it always tasted the same, no matter the meat
label1 He made stew too and like my mama's
label1 I ate his stew from the time I was a whipper,  to I was a full grown man
label1 And no matter the meat, it always tasted like uncle charly's stew
label1 Now I ain't had minnie's stew in six months, so I ain't no expert, but that,  damn sure is minnie's stew
label1 And this
label1 When I sat in it earlier, I couldn't belive it
label1 Nobody sits in sweet Dave's chaire
label1 This may be minnie's place, but this is damn sure,  sweet Dave's chair
label1 I'm pretty goddamn sure that chair's be going with him
label1 What's in the chair
label1 Just what I thought
label1 Sweet Dave's goddamn blood
label1 So...  Are you actually accusing me of murder
label1 The way I see it, senior Bob,  whoever's workin' with her,  ain't who they say they is
label1 They're lyin' out back there dead somewhere
label1 Or if it's you britisch man,  the real oswaldo mobray is lyin' in a ditch somewhere
label1 And  you're just an English fella' passin' off his papers
label1 Or we go by my theory, which is the ugliest guy did it
label1 So I take it you've deduced the coffy was  poisoned while you were murdering the old man
label1 Yes
label1 Well, mi negro amigo, during that whole incident..
label1 Playing silent night on the piano
label1 I didn't say you poisoned the coffy
label1 I said you didn't make the stew
label1 My theory is...  You're working with man who poisoned the coffy
label1 And both of y'all murdered minnie,  and sweet Dave and whoever else picked this bad luck  day to visit minnie's haberdashery this morning
label1 And at some point, y'all intented to bushwhack John Ruth and free Daisy
label1 That's as far as I got
label1 How am I doin'
label1 Your a real imaginative nigger, ain't you
label1 So, do you intend to murder me based on a far fetched nigger theory
label1 It ain't so far fetched, senior Bob
label1 And it's a little bit more then my theory
label1 How long you say you been working for minnie's
label1 Four months
label1 Minnie mentioned that to you
label1 No
label1 You know what that sign said, senior Bob
label1 "No dogs or Mexicans allowed"  minnie hung that sign up the day she opened this habadashery
label1 You know why she took it down
label1 She started lettin' in dogs
label1 Now minnie likes just about everybody, but she sure don't like Mexicans
label1 So when you tell me, minnie went to north side to visit her mama
label1 Well I find that highly unlikely... but okay  maybe
label1 Well that's what I meant in the barn when I said: "That sure don't sound like minnie"
label1 Now I am calling you a liar, senior Bob
label1 And if you lyin, which you are,  then you killed minnie  and sweet Dave
label1 That still don't get us no closer...  To which one of y'all poisoned the coffy, though
label1 Does it Chris
label1 No it sure don't
label1 Now one of y'all poisoned this coffy, to free Daisy
label1 Okay, time's up
label1 Stop
label1 Alright I did it, it was me I poisoned the coffy
label1 I fuckin' knew it
label1 Major Warren please let me sent this ugly son of a bitch to hell
label1 You killed o.B
label1 He's worth ten of you
label1 Say adios to your huevos
label1 Major Warren
label1 Chapter five the four passengers  earlier that morning

label1 Just get warm

label1 But I'll tell ya what it is
label1 It's hot and it's strong and it's good
label1 And  in this snow it sure 'nuff warms your ass up
label1 You don't need to sell it, minnie, you need make it
label1 And you need to get your ass out there and  help charly with them bags and get Ed in here
label1 I'll fix you
label1 I don't know some old man
label1 Well I don't know what I'm suppose to do about it
label1 I'm just tellin' you what she said
label1 Anyway she sent me out here to help charly, she wants to talk to you
label1 Would you roll me a cigarette
label1 Sure honey, I smoke red apple tobacco, that all right
label1 It's my favorite
label1 Don't mind me gentlemen, I'm just watching
label1 You know, I must of had at least twelve people,  teach me that goddamn game
label1 Just never could keep the moves in my head
label1 But if I'm not disturbing, I like to watch
label1 Hell no
label1 I like whippin' this old man's ass in front of a audience,  you ain't whippin' shit
label1 Merci beaucoup mademoiselle, minnie
label1 Oh that's real nice, what is that
label1 It's French
label1 Oui   oui  what is that mean
label1 It means yes
label1 Hey Dave, ask me if my ass is fat

label1 Thank you sugar
label1 Allow me to assist you, madame
label1 Peppermint stick

label1 So why do they call you six horse Judy anyway
label1 Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever seen that could drive a six horse team
label1 Hell yeah, kinda of a stupid question
label1 Could you holding this for me
label1 Rock steady, madame
label1 You gotta' very sweet accent, where that from, England
label1 I take exception to that
label1 New zeeland
label1 Carefull, madame
label1 Auckland, what the fuck is an Auckland
label1 Coffy's ready
label1 It's about damn time
label1 Best coffy on the mountain
label1 I'll don't know 'bout all that
label1 Stagecoach drivers like it
label1 Most find it a mite too strong
label1 Can't be too strong on this mountain, thank you
label1 Well, what'd ya' think
label1 Shit
label1 He adds something, not much, but something
label1 What do you think, Pete
label1 Well I must admit, he does make the set up more convincing
label1 And then start unhitching the horses and get 'em in the barn and get 'em fed
label1 To drag these fat bastards up and down the mountain that's fucking impossible, mate
label1 Look I just started working here
label1 Whatever minnie to make y'all mad
label1 I had nothing to do with it
label1 Well old man,  if you was a cat what just happened here  would count as one of your nine lives
label1 You realize how close you came to being tossed on a pile of niggers
label1 Yes
label1 You believe that
label1 I expect no less
label1 Not so fast old man
label1 You might have a way out of this yet
label1 And he's gonna have my sister with him,  and he's gonna have her in chains
label1 He's taking her into red rock to be hung
label1 No
label1 Ten thousand dollars
label1 And when he get's here
label1 I'm gonna' kill that fella' and turn my sister lose
label1 Now do you have any reason why you'd want to interfere  with me saving my sister from a hangman's rope
label1 No
label1 You don't
label1 You sure you don't
label1 I mean we did just kill minnie and sweet Dave
label1 You and sweet Dave seemed pretty chummy over here
label1 I just met these people
label1 I don't give a damn about them, or you, or your sister,  or any other son of a bitch in Wyoming for that matter
label1 That is a good answer, old man
label1 And you don't do nothin'
label1 You don't say nothin'
label1 Hello, thank you, good night, that's about it
label1 Maybe your name, but that's it
label1 Maybe my name
label1 Be an old man, be dotty
label1 Go to sleep
label1 And don't you say nothin' and I mean nothin'  to that bounty hunter that's got my sister
label1 Yes
label1 When it's safe I kill him, free my sister and leave you be
label1 Deal
label1 During the next four hours, Jody and the boys Chuck the bodies down the well
label1 Put away the horses
label1 Tidied around minnie's
label1 Stash weapons for further use
label1 Here they come
label1 Okay boys, this is it, get ready
label1 Let's get ready
label1 Now remember, it dosen't matter if we have four men or fory,  we're still gonna' be facing John Ruth chained  to my sister with a pistol pointed at her belly
label1 Now killin' that fella' 'fore he kills my sister, ain't gonna' be easy
label1 But you believe that's exactly what we're gonna do
label1 Trapped here for two or three days, at some point, he will close his eyes  and that's when you blow the top of his head off
label1 Remember old man, my sister don't make it off this mountain alive, neither do you
label1 I'll do my best
label1 What the hell's going on, we weren't expecting another stage tonight
label1 I can see you already got another one up in here
label1 I just got through putting the horses away
label1 But we are stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,  so it looks like you're stuck with us
label1 I can do another one
label1 They ain't here
label1 I'm running the place while they're gone
label1 Where's minnie and sweet Dave
label1 He says they ain't here
label1 He's lookin' after the place while they gone
label1 Who are you

label1 I think I'm gonna die
label1 And these motherfuckers did it
label1 How you doin'
label1 Well my leg hurts really bad
label1 But I think if I'm put all my weight on my right foot  I'm just bein' sarcastic I don't give a fuck about your leg
label1 Don't worry about my comfort
label1 Shit
label1 I can't feel my ass no more
label1 Worry about these owl hoots and that bushwhacker nuts shooter in the basement
label1 All right
label1 Fella' in the basement
label1 You either give up by the time I count to three,  or I shoot domergue in the head
label1 One!..
label1 No, no, no, no
label1 I'm comin' up
label1 Hold on there you bushwhacker sack shooter, you  just open the door we tell you to come up
label1 Now throw out your pistol
label1 Throw it to the bed
label1 Well he got another
label1 Now throw out your other pistol
label1 I ain't got another pistol
label1 Cause if you don't throw one up here in the next two seconds we gonna' kill this bitch
label1 See
label1 Told ya'
label1 Now...  With your hands where we can see 'em..
label1 How ya' doin' dummy
label1 Better now I see your ugly face
label1 How you like you that
label1 You bushwhacker castrator
label1 It took him too long so I done for him
label1 Joe gage get your ass over and shut this trap door
label1 I'm sorry, honey
label1 May I sit in the chair
label1 Yes you may
label1 And don't move 'em
label1 You sure picked the wrong time to turn into a nigger lover
label1 Don't you see that nigger and John Ruth put you smack dab in the middle of danger
label1 You're about to be murdered in some nigger named  minnie's house and you don't even know why
label1 Okay, bitch..
label1 I'll bite... why
label1 But not cause they got butterflies in their belly 'bout me
label1 But because we're all gang members, the Jody domergue gang
label1 That fella' y'all just killed in the basement, was Jody domergue, my brother
label1 Well who the hell, is Jody domergue
label1 You wanna tell 'em bounty man
label1 He's worth fifty thousand dollars
label1 And every member of his gang is wort at least ten
label1 And what's gonna' happen when that sun comes  out nigger, so is my brother's fifteen men  comin' straight here for us
label1 Tell 'em grouch
label1 Jody's got fifteen men waitin' in red rock
label1 If we couldn't kill John Ruth and free Daisy here
label1 Their job was to sack the town, kill John Ruth and free Daisy there
label1 Oh yeah
label1 And Chris I'm tellin' you, you ain't done anything yet, we can't forgive
label1 So...   Let's make a deal
label1 No deals, bitch
label1 You gonna' let that nigger speak for you, Chris
label1 Seein' as she ain't got nothin' to sell, I'm  kinda curious about her sales pitch, humor me
label1 All right, bitch
label1 Easy
label1 Take your gun, shoot that nigger dead
label1 Then we sit here all nice like for the next two days
label1 Well... we can give 'em Marco
label1 Bob's real name is "Marco the Mexican"
label1 He's worth twelve thousand dollars
label1 That's "Marco the Mexican"
label1 Precisely, yeah
label1 Sheeit, after I blew his face off, Marco ain't worth a peso
label1 If I die in the next two days, which is more than likely, you can have me
label1 And it's all your Chris
label1 You keep talkin', Pete
label1 You gonna talk yourself to death
label1 Grouch douglass
label1 You heard of him
label1 Yeah, I heard of grouch douglass
label1 He's worth ten, just like Daisy
label1 Remind me,  why we wouldn't just kill all y'all and cash in
label1 Oh, you can kill us all
label1 Because when that snow melts, the rest of Jody's  gang  all fifteen of 'em that were waiting,  in red rock are comin' here
label1 Now let, let's say you shoot us all..
label1 If you really want all that domergue gang bounty money,  you still got to get all our corpses into red rock
label1 And that ain't gonna' be so easy
label1 And that wagon out there is too heavy for a two horse team
label1 So that means you're gonna' hafta' lead a string of horses into red rock  and with that deep snow after a blizzard,  you ain't gonna' be able to get away with any more then let's say one body per horse
label1 So that's you, leading a string of four horses into red rock,  and with all them horses, in that snow,  and you all by your lonesome, you're gonna be a mite poky
label1 And you gonna' run smack dab into the domergue  gang and agin grouch, how many is that
label1 And when those fifteen killers,  come across you,  in possession of all of our dead bodies, they  ain't just gonna' kill you and that nigger
label1 There gonna go back to red rock and kill every son of a bitch in that town
label1 You really the sheriff of red rock
label1 Then shoot that nigger dead
label1 Well good 'cos 'bout meet him
label1 Anybody else wanna' make a deal, huh
label1 The deal still stands, Chris
label1 You ain't done we can't forgive
label1 It's still all on that nigger

label2 We recognize that we are poor sinners in the hands of an angry God
label2 Let the circle be unbroken...  until the day
label2 Amen
label2 [ All ] Amen
label2 This is rumor control
label2 Here are the facts
label2 As some of you know,  a 337 model E.E.V....  crashlanded here at 0600...  on the morning watch
label2 There was one survivor,  two dead and a droid that was hopelessly smashed beyond repair
label2 The survivor is a woman
label2 I just want to say that I've taken a vow of celibacy
label2 That also includes women
label2 Yes
label2 I'd like to say that I, for one,  do not appreciate company policy allowing her to freely...  intermingle with inmates and the rest of the staff
label2 We are well aware of your feelings in this matter
label2 You will be pleased to know that I have requested a rescue team
label2 Hopefully, they will be here inside of a week  Oh, come on
label2 And evacuate her A.S.A.P
label2 She doesn't seem too badly damaged
label2 She's unconscious
label2 Can't give you a more specific diagnosis at the moment
label2 Will she live
label2 I would think so
label2 It's in everybody's interest...  the woman doesn't come out of the infirmary until the rescue team arrives
label2 And certainly not without an escort, right
label2 Sir
label2 Gentlemen, we should all stick to our set routine...  and not get unduly agitated
label2 Right
label2 All right
label2 Thank you, gentlemen
label2 All right
label2 there ain't gonna be much left
label2 It's just a little cocktail of my own mix
label2 Sort of eyeopener
label2 You a doctor
label2 My name is Clemens
label2 Here
label2 Fury 161
label2 It's one of WeylandYutani's backwater work prisons,  it grieves me to say
label2 Do you mind
label2 This is basically a stabilizer
label2 We have a big problem with lice here
label2 And when you're feeling better, I'll give you some clippers,  and you can tend to your private parts yourself
label2 How'd I get here
label2 Evidently separated from your mother ship before you hit our atmosphere
label2 You have any idea how long you were in hypersleep
label2 'Cause coming out the way you did can be quite a jolt to the system
label2 Indeed
label2 Where are the others
label2 What
label2 They didn't survive
label2 I have to get to the ship
label2 Have to get to the ship
label2 You're in no condition for that
label2 You want to get me some clothes, or should I just go like this
label2 Given the nature of our indigenous population, I would suggest clothes
label2 [ Clears Throat ]  None of them have seen a woman in years
label2 This used to be a 5,000 convict facility,  but it's been reduced to a custodial staff of 25
label2 Keep the pilot light on
label2 The pilot light for what
label2 Blast furnace
label2 We have a foundry, Lieutenant Ripley
label2 The inmates forge lead sheets for toxic waste containers
label2 How do you know my name
label2 It's stenciled on the back of your shorts
label2 Where are the bodies
label2 We have a morgue
label2 We put them there until the investigative team arrives in about a week, I think
label2 There was a droid
label2 There were bits and pieces of him all over the place
label2 We put what was left on the rubbish tip
label2 He never knew what hit him
label2 And the girl
label2 I don't think she was conscious when it happened
label2 Um, I'm sorry
label2 Where is she
label2 In the morgue
label2 I have to see her
label2 I have to see what's left of her
label2 Is there any particular reason that you're so insistent
label2 I have to be sure how she died
label2 I hate to be repetitious about such a sensitive subject,  but it is persectly clear that she drowned
label2 Was she your daughter
label2 She wasn't
label2 Um  CCould I have a moment alone, please
label2 Yes, of course
label2 What's she doing
label2 Okay
label2 No
label2 What
label2 I told you,  we have to make sure how she died
label2 And I told you, she drowned
label2 II have to see inside of her
label2 You're disorientated
label2 Half your system's still in  I have a very, very good reason
label2 Well, perhaps you'd like to share that reason
label2 What kind exactly
label2 Cholera
label2 There hasn't been a case of cholera reported for 200 years
label2 Please
label2 Everything's in place
label2 There's no sign of infection
label2 No indication of disease
label2 Chest
label2 Open the chest
label2 Lungs
label2 Flooded with fluid
label2 Ergo, she drowned
label2 Mr. Clemens
label2 Superintendent
label2 I don't believe you've met Lieutenant Ripley
label2 That's right, sir
label2 What's going on, Mr. Clemens
label2 Second, in the interest of public health,  I am performing an autopsy
label2 Without my authority
label2 Well, there didn't seem to be time
label2 But it's turned out all right
label2 There's no sign of contagion in the body
label2 But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley didn't parade around in front of the prisoners,  as I am told she did in the last hour
label2 It might also be helpful...  if you kept me informed as to any change in her physical status
label2 Or would that be asking too much
label2 Nonsense
label2 We'll keep the bodies on ice till the rescue team arrives
label2 On ice
label2 There is the public health issue
label2 I thought you said there was no sign of disease
label2 It would appear that the child drowned
label2 But without the benefit of proper laboratory tests,  it's impossible to be absolutely certain
label2 I would consider it unwise...  to tolerate even the possibility of an unwelcome virus
label2 An outbreak of cholera would look extremely bad on a report
label2 Would it not, sir
label2 We've 25 prisoners in this facility
label2 All thieves, rapists, murderers, child molesters
label2 All scum
label2 Just because they've taken on religion doesn't make them any less dangerous
label2 I try not to offend their convictions
label2 I don't want to upset the order
label2 And I don't want a woman walking around giving them ideas
label2 I see
label2 For my own personal safety
label2 I will leave the details of the cremation to you, Mr. Clemens
label2 They may use the furnace, but I want everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours
label2 You called it, sir
label2 Ah, Christmas has come early, Murph
label2 Any dead ox is a good ox
label2 You're bloody right
label2 Smelly bastards, all covered in lice
label2 God, I hates hosin' these bastards down
label2 I always get shite all over me boots
label2 Talkin' of hosing things down, FrankYeah
label2 You had the chance, what would you say to her
label2 What do you mean, if I got the chance
label2 You know
label2 You mean, casual like
label2 Yeah
label2 I mean, how would you put it to her if you bumped into her in the mess hall or somewhere
label2 I've never had any problem with the ladies
label2 I'd say to her, "Good day, my dear
label2 Anything I can do to be of service?
label2 Then I'd give her the look, you knowup and down
label2 [ Grunts ]  And I'd give her the wink, the dirty smile
label2 Yeah, right
label2 And then she'd say, "Kiss my ass, you horny old fucker!
label2 I'd be happy to kiss her ass
label2 I'd be happy to kiss her anywhere she wants
label2 Yeah, but treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen
label2 Right, Frank
label2 Told you before, Murph
label2 Treat a queen like a whore and a whore like a queen
label2 What do you think killed Babe
label2 Beats me
label2 She just keeled over
label2 How old was she
label2 In her prime
label2 Never mind
label2 We'll chop her up later and throw her in the stew
label2 Hey, Frank
label2 What's this
label2 "Their bodies...  "have been taken from the shadow of our nights
label2 "They have been released...  from all darkness and pain.
label2 "The child and the man...  "have gone beyond our world
label2 "They are forever eternal...  "and everlasting
label2 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
label2 Why are the innocent punished
label2 Why the pain
label2 There aren't any promises
label2 Only that some get called, some get saved
label2 She won't ever know the hardship and grief...  for those of us left behind
label2 We commit these bodies to the void...  with a glad heart
label2 For within each seed,  there is a promise of a flower
label2 [ Gurgling ]  And within each death,  no matter how small,  there's always a new life
label2 Amen
label2 I'll tell you, it's fucking weird
label2 The only one to survive that crash is a woman
label2 What trouble can she cause
label2 She's already changed everything
label2 Okay
label2 Any you guys want to tell me what the problem is
label2 Come on
label2 Speak to me, brothers
label2 All right
label2 I don't mind the dark
label2 I don't mind the bugs
label2 I don't mind wanderin' around in some cold, wet, damp tunnel for a week at a time
label2 I don't mind anything
label2 But I mind Golic
label2 That the way you feel about it
label2 Yeah
label2 The guy's crazy and he smells bad
label2 Well, he's going with you
label2 Golic is just another poor, miserable, suffering son of a bitch, just like you and me
label2 'Cept he smells worse
label2 And he's crazy
label2 Knock off the shit
label2 You got a job to do
label2 Okay
label2 As I thought, Mr. Aaron
label2 You called it, sir
label2 I just wanted to, uh, say thanks for what you said at the funeral
label2 It was, uh  My friends would have appreciated it
label2 Yeah, well, you don't wanna know me, lady
label2 I'm a murderer and rapist of women
label2 Really
label2 Do you have any faith, sister
label2 Not much
label2 Well, we've got a lot of faith here
label2 I thought women weren't allowed
label2 Well, we've never had any before,  but we tolerate anybody
label2 Even the intolerable
label2 Thank you
label2 That's just a statement of principle
label2 Nothing personal
label2 You see, we've got a good place to wait here
label2 What are you waiting for
label2 Huh
label2 of the alternative people...  embraced religion, as it were, about five years ago
label2 Tincture
label2 [ Ripley ] I'm on medication
label2 Hardly
label2 Some sort of apocalyptic, millenarian, Christian fundamentalist, uh  Right
label2 Exactly
label2 And they were allowed to remain as custodians...  with two minders...  and a medical officer
label2 And here we are
label2 How did you get this wonderful assignment
label2 How do you like your new haircut
label2 It's okay
label2 You attracted to me

label2 Ln that way

label2 Are you down there
label2 What are you doing
label2 I really appreciate your affections,  but I am aware that they... deflected my question
label2 In the nicest possible way, of course
label2 You're spoiling the mood
label2 I have a job to do
label2 I just want to know why we had to cremate the bodies
label2 And now that I'm in your cot,  you think I owe you an answer
label2 Being in my bed's got nothing to do with it
label2 And I had to be sure what killed her
label2 Anyway, I made a mistake
label2 Possibly
label2 made another mistake
label2 Really
label2 What's that
label2 Fraternizing with a prisoner
label2 It's against the rules, isn't it
label2 Definitely
label2 L think you know
label2 I'm not a prisoner
label2 You have a bar code on the back of your head
label2 That does deserve an explanation
label2 But I don't think now is the moment

label2 On Intercom ] Mr. Clemens
label2 Mr. Aaron
label2 Superintendent Andrews would like you to report...  to vent shaft 22 on the second quadrantnow
label2 We've had an accident
label2 You could call it that
label2 One of our prisoners has been... diced
label2 Sorry
label2 I have to go
label2 Who was it
label2 Murphy
label2 How do you know
label2 I gave him the assignment, sir
label2 He was a wanker
label2 It wasn't your fault
label2 Well, not much to say, is there
label2 Death was instantaneous
label2 No shit
label2 Sudden rush of air, I'd imagine, except  Right
label2 Almost happened to me once
label2 I've told him so many times, "Stay away from the fans.
label2 Nobody bloody listens
label2 What's that
label2 I don't know
label2 I want to see you in my quarters in 30 minutes, if you'll please, Mr. Clemens
label2 Have you got any ideas
label2 Here you are
label2 You know, wandering around without an escort...  is really gonna piss Superintendent Andrews off
label2 One of the prisoners has been killed
label2 Really
label2 How
label2 Hmm
label2 In the air shaft
label2 I found something at the accident site,  just a bit away from where it happened
label2 A mark
label2 Rather like the one you found on the girl's cryotube
label2 Look
label2 I'm on your side
label2 Lf you really wanna help,  find me a computer with audio capabilities...  so I can access this flight recorder
label2 We don't have anything like that here
label2 Bishop
label2 The droid that crashed with me
label2 I can point you in the right direction
label2 I can't join you
label2 I have a previous engagement
label2 Golic, don't fidget
label2 What's all this shit
label2 What the hell does he ever do right
label2 Eat
label2 He's got that down pretty good
label2 You light a candle for Murphy
label2 I'll light a thousand
label2 Never complained about me once
label2 Is it true what they say
label2 His head split into a million pieces
label2 Sit down, Mr. Clemens
label2 Thank you
label2 Sugar
label2 Uh, no thanks
label2 Milk
label2 Just a little, please
label2 Listen to me, you piece of shit
label2 You screw with me one more time, I'll cut you in half
label2 I don't think I understand
label2 At 0700 hours, I received word from the network
label2 They want this woman looked after
label2 They consider her to be very high priority
label2 Why
label2 L have no idea
label2 But why did you let her out of the infirmary
label2 This accident with Murphy is what happens...  when one of these dumb sons of a bitches walks around with a hardon
label2 You're the jailer
label2 We both know exactly what you are
label2 I think it might be better if I left
label2 I find you... unpleasant to be around
label2 You do
label2 Isn't that lovely
label2 Consider this, Mr. Clemens
label2 How would you like me to explain your sordid history...  to your newfound friend
label2 Now sit the hell down
label2 I don't like you
label2 You're unpredictable
label2 Insolent
label2 You question everything
label2 If I didn't need a medical officer,  I wouldn't let you within light years of this operation
label2 I'm eternally grateful
label2 Keep your sarcasms to yourself
label2 Now, is there anything I should know
label2 About the woman
label2 Don't play with me, Mr. Clemens
label2 You spend every second you can with her
label2 Has she said anything to youanything about where she's from, what her mission is
label2 What the hell she was doing in an E.E.V.
label2 Beyond that, I assume it's all classified
label2 I haven't pressed her for more
label2 That's all
label2 That's all
label2 Yes
label2 Nothing more
label2 No
label2 Get out of here
label2 [ Screams ]  Shut up, you fuckin' bitch
label2 Shut up, you bitch

label2 Goddamn it, let go of me
label2 Fuck you
label2 Hold still
label2 Shh
label2 Shh
label2 Goddamn it
label2 You okay
label2 No
label2 Son of a bitch
label2 Take off
label2 We've gotta discuss some matters of the spirit
label2 Cigarettes
label2 So let's do it
label2 This is like 1 0 city blocks
label2 How many
label2 Can't you chew a little quieter
label2 I'm trying to figure out how big this compartment is
label2 I can't think with all this goddamn noise you're making
label2 You're not supposed to swear
label2 I'm sorry
label2 What
label2 What the shit is doing that
label2 Swearing
label2 Shut up
label2 It ain't against God
label2 What the hell is going on with the candles
label2 Must be the wind from one of the vent shafts
label2 Backwash from the closest circulating unit
label2 But if all the candles go out, how the hell we gonna know where we are
label2 I guess I'm nominated
label2 Watch your step, brother
label2 Wait, wait, wait
label2 Quick, grab it
label2 Here
label2 Help me
label2 Go
label2 Fuckin' go
label2 Quick
label2 Run
label2 Gimme that
label2 Get this fucking thing off me
label2 Let me go
label2 Ah, Ripley
label2 Hi, Bishop
label2 How you feeling
label2 Uh, listen, I'm sorry
label2 It's okay
label2 I'm just a glorified toaster
label2 How are you
label2 I like your new haircut
label2 Bishop, can you access data on the flight recorder
label2 Golic
label2 I'm home
label2 What happened on the Sulaco
label2 Stasis interrupted
label2 Fire in cryogenic compartment
label2 Repeat
label2 Fire in cryogenic What happened
label2 What started the fire, Bishop
label2 Can you hear me
label2 The fire was electrical
label2 Did the sensors pick up anything moving around on the ship prior to separation
label2 It's very dark here, Ripley
label2 I'm not what I used to be
label2 Just tell me
label2 Yes
label2 Is it on the Sulaco or did it come with us on the E.E.V.
label2 It was with us all the way
label2 Does the company know
label2 The company knows everything that happened on the ship
label2 It all goes into the computer and gets sent back to network
label2 And they want it
label2 Do me a favor
label2 Disconnect me
label2 I could be reworked, but I'll never be top of the line again
label2 I'd rather be nothing
label2 Do it for me, Ripley
label2 It wasn't me
label2 I didn't do it
label2 Feeds on minds
label2 It was  Nobody can stop it
label2 What about Boggs and Rains
label2 It wasn't me
label2 It wasn't me
label2 Stark raving mad
label2 I'm not saying it was anyone's fault, but he should have been chained up
label2 Mad as a fucking hatter
label2 Keep him separated from the rest
label2 I don't want him causing a panic
label2 Clemens, sedate this poor idiot
label2 Yeah
label2 Now, now
label2 Pull yourself together
label2 Talk to me now
label2 Now, where are Boggs and Rains
label2 It wasn't me
label2 It wasn't me
label2 We'll have to send out a search team
label2 I'm afraid we'll have to assume there's a very good chance...  this simple bastard has murdered them
label2 Now, you don't know that
label2 He's never lied to me
label2 He's telling the truth
label2 It was a dragon
label2 [ Andrews ] You're not talking to anyone, Lieutenant
label2 I'm not interested in your opinion,  because you are not in full possession of the facts
label2 This man is a convicted multiple murderer, known for particularly brutal crimes
label2 Yeah
label2 That part's right
label2 Then I'll talk to you
label2 When I have finished with my official duties,  I will be quite pleased to have a little chat, yes
label2 Let me see if I have this correct, Lieutenant
label2 It's an eightfoot creature of some kind,  with acid for blood, and it arrived on your spaceship
label2 It kills on sight and is generally unpleasant
label2 And, of course, you expect me to accept all this on your word
label2 No, I don't expect anything
label2 Quite a story, Mr. Aaron
label2 Right, sir
label2 Never heard anything quite like it, sir
label2 Expect not
label2 Well, what kind of weapons have you got
label2 This is a prison
label2 It's not a good idea to allow prisoners access to firearms
label2 What keeps them from killing you
label2 There's no way to escape
label2 With the arrival of the next supply ship, the company would eliminate them
label2 This is a maximum security prison,  and you have no weapons of any kind
label2 A few more in the mess hall
label2 Some fire axes scattered about the place
label2 Nothing terribly formidable
label2 We're on the honor system
label2 Then we're fucked
label2 No, you're fucked
label2 Confined to the infirmary
label2 Quarantined
label2 Mr. Aaron will escort you
label2 I think you'll be safe from any large, nasty beast while you're there, right
label2 all report to the mess hall
label2 Mess hall, right away, people
label2 Isn't there any way off of this place
label2 Some way to escape
label2 No
label2 Supply ship comes every six months
label2 And that's it
label2 Fuck
label2 They are sending somebody to pick you up quite soon, I gather
label2 Really
label2 [ Coughs ] What's "soon"
label2 I don't know
label2 Do you want to tell me what you and Andrews talked about
label2 You'll just say I'm crazy
label2 That's a bit uncharitable
label2 [ Inhales, Coughing ]  How are you feeling
label2 Sore throat
label2 Sick to my stomach
label2 Well, that's understandable given the circumstances
label2 Perhaps I should give you one of my special cocktails
label2 blames everybody for everything
label2 There's no such thing as a perfect human
label2 In an insane world,  a sane man...  must... appear... insane
label2 That's very profound, Golic
label2 Thank you
label2 You married
label2 Me
label2 You should get married, have kids
label2 I used to know lots of 'em back home
label2 They used to like me
label2 For a while
label2 You're gonna die too
label2 Are you
label2 Just curious
label2 No
label2 How about leveling with me
label2 Could you be more specific
label2 When I asked how you got assigned here, you avoided the question
label2 And then when I asked about the prison I.D
label2 Lt's a long, sad story...  and more than a little melodramatic
label2 Try me
label2 If you insist
label2 After my student years,  despite the fact that I had become...  secretly addicted to morphine,  I was considered to be most promising,  a man with a future
label2 And during my first residency, I did a 36hour stretch on an E.R
label2 Then I got called back
label2 And 1 1 of them died
label2 Not as a result of the accident...  but because I prescribed the wrong dosage of painkiller
label2 I got seven years in prison and my license reduced to a 3C
label2 At least I got off the morphine
label2 L'm sorry
label2 L think I was let off lightly
label2 I got to know this motley crew quite well
label2 So when they stayed, I stayed
label2 Nobody else would employ me
label2 Magnificent
label2 Give us strength, O Lord, to endure
label2 We recognize that we are poor sinners in the hands of an angry God
label2 Let the circle be unbroken until the day
label2 the fuck is happening here
label2 What the fuck is this bullshit that's comin' down
label2 We got murder
label2 We got rape
label2 We got brothers in trouble
label2 I don't want no more bullshit around here
label2 Now, we got problems, we stand together
label2 Thank you, Mr. Dillon
label2 Once again, this is rumor control
label2 Here are the facts
label2 At 0800 hours, prisoner Murphy,  through carelessness on his part,  was found dead in vent shaft 1 7

label2 I think it's fair to say that our smoothly running facility...  has suddenly developed a few problems
label2 I can only hope we are able to all pull together over the next few days...  until the rescue team arrives for Lieutenant Ripley

label2 <i>For a second, I forget about Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>  <i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>  It's getting exciting now
label2 <i>That old thing, how you always hurt the one you love.</i>  <i>Well, it works both ways.</i>  <i>We have frontrow seats for this theater of mass destruction.</i>  <i>The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem</i>  <i>wrapped the foundations of 12 buildings with explosives.</i>  <i>In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges</i>  <i>and a few blocks will be reduced to smouldering rubble.</i>  <i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>  Two and a half
label2 <i>Suddenly I realize that all of this, the gun, the bombs, the revolution,</i>  <i>has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>  <i>Bob
label2 Bob had bitch tits.</i>  <i>This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.</i>  <i>The big moosie slobbering all over me, that was Bob.</i>  We're still men
label2 Yes, we're men
label2 <i>Bob had had his testicles removed
label2 Then hormone therapy.</i>  <i>He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high</i>  <i>and his body upped the oestrogen.</i>  <i> That was where I fit..
label2 <i>No, wait
label2 Back up
label2 Let me start earlier.</i>  <i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>  <i>I couldn't sleep.</i>  <i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>  <i>Everything's far away.</i>  <i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>  <i>of a copy.</i>  <i>When deep space exploration ramps up, it'll be the corporations that name everything.</i>  <i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>  <i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>  <i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>  I need you out of town this week to cover some red flags
label2 <i>It must have been Tuesday
label2 He had on his cornflower blue tie.</i>  You want me to deprioritize my reports until you advise of a status upgrade
label2 Here's your flight coupons
label2 Call me if there's any snags
label2 <i>He was full of pep
label2 I'd like to order  the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles
label2 <i> Please hold
label2 Anything clever,</i>  <i>like a coffee table in the shape of a yinyang, I had to have it.</i>  <i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>  <i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>  <i>Or the Ohamshab sofa with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>  <i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of environmentallyfriendly unbleached paper.</i>  <i>I'd flip through catalogues and wonder</i>  <i>"What kind of dining set defines me as a person
label2 "</i>  <i>I had it all
label2 Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>  <i>proof that they were crafted by the honest, hardworking, indigenous peoples of...</i>  <i> Please hold
label2 ..wherever.</i>  <i>We used to read pornography.</i>  <i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>   No
label2 You can't die of insomnia
label2 What about narcolepsy
label2 I have no idea how I got there
label2 Can you please just give me something
label2 <i>Red and blue Tuinals, lipstickred Seconals...</i>  No
label2 You need healthy, natural sleep
label2 Chew some valerian root and get more exercise
label2 I'm in pain
label2 You wanna see pain
label2 Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights
label2 See the guys with testicular cancer
label2 That's pain
label2 I always wanted three kids... two boys and a girl
label2 Mindy wanted two girls and a boy
label2 Well, I... She...  She had her first child last week
label2 A girl
label2 With... With her... With her new husband
label2 Fuck
label2 I'm glad for her
label2 She deserves...  Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us
label2 I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage
label2 And that gives me strength
label2 We give each other strength
label2 It's time for the oneonones
label2 Could you find a partner
label2 <i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>  <i>His eyes already shrinkwrapped in tears.</i>  <i>Knees together
label2 Bob
label2 <i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>  <i>You know that chest expansion programme on latenight TV?</i>  <i>That was his idea.</i>  I was a juicer
label2 You know, using steroids
label2 Diabonal and  Wisterol
label2 Oh, they use that on racehorses, for Christ sakes
label2 I'm divorced
label2 My two grown kids  won't even return my phone calls
label2 <i>Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>  Go ahead,... Cornelius
label2 You can cry
label2 I let go.</i>  That's really good
label2 <i>Lost in oblivion.</i>  <i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>  <i>I found freedom
label2 Losing all hope was freedom.</i>  It's OK.  <i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>  <i>I became addicted.</i>  If I didn't say anything  people always assumed the worst
label2 They cried harder... then I cried harder
label2 Now we're going to open the green door, the heart chakra...  <i>I wasn't really dying.</i>  <i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>  <i>I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.</i>  Imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light
label2 It moves over your body, healing you
label2 Now keep this going
label2 To your cave
label2 Step forward  into your cave
label2 That's right
label2 You're going deeper into your cave
label2 And you're going to find  your power animal
label2 Slide
label2 <i>Every evening I died.</i>  <i>And every evening I was born again.</i>  <i>Resurrected.</i>  <i>Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too.</i>  <i>Being there, pressed against his tits,</i>  <i>ready to cry.</i>  <i>This was my vacation.</i>  <i>And she</i>  <i>ruined everything.</i>  This is cancer, right
label2 So once again,</i>  <i>I couldn't sleep.</i>  <i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>  <i>after we open our heart chakras, when it's time to hug,</i>  <i>I'm gonna grab that bitch, Marla Singer, and scream.</i>  Marla, you liar
label2 You big tourist, I need this
label2 Now, get out
label2 <i>Oh, yeah
label2 Chloe.</i>  <i>Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton would look if you made it walk around</i>  <i>being extra nice to everybody.</i>  Well, I'm still here
label2 But I don't know for how long
label2 That's as much certainty as anyone can give me
label2 But I've got some good news
label2 But..
label2 I am in a pretty lonely place
label2 I'm so close to the end, and all I want is to get laid for the last time
label2 I have pornographic movies in my apartment,   and lubricants and amyl nitrite
label2 Thank you, Chloe
label2 Everyone, let's thank Chloe
label2 Thank you, Chloe
label2 Now, let's ready ourselves for guided meditation
label2 You step inside your cave and you walk...  <i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>  <i>Marla.</i>  <i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.</i>  <i>But you can't.</i>  <i>..deeper into your cave as you walk.</i>  <i>You feel a healing energy all around you.</i>  <i>Now find your power animal.</i>  Slide
label2 OK. Let's partner up
label2 Pick someone special to you tonight
label2 Hey
label2 We need to talk
label2 What
label2 Yeah
label2 You're a faker
label2 You're not dying
label2 Sorry
label2 But you're not dying the way Chloe is
label2 So
label2 So you're a tourist
label2 I've seen you
label2 I saw you at testicular cancer
label2 I saw you practising this
label2 Practising what
label2 Telling me off
label2 Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert
label2 I'll expose you
label2 Go ahead
label2 Come together
label2 Let yourselves cry
label2 Why are you doing this
label2 It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee
label2 Look, this is important
label2 I've been coming for over a year
label2 Why do you do it
label2 I don't know
label2 When people think you're dying, they listen to you instead of..
label2 Yeah
label2 Yeah
label2 Share yourself... completely
label2 Look, you don't want to get into this
label2 It becomes an addiction
label2 Really
label2 I can't cry if another faker is present, and I need this
label2 Candystripe a cancer ward
label2 It's not my problem
label2 No, wait a second
label2 Hold on
label2 We'll split up the week, OK
label2 You take tuberculosis
label2 My smoking doesn't go over at all
label2 OK. Good
label2 Testicular cancer should be no contest
label2 Technically, I have more right to be there
label2 You still have your balls
label2 You're kidding
label2 I dunno
label2 Am I
label2 No
label2 What do you want
label2 I'll take the parasites
label2 Take the blood parasites
label2 I want brain parasites
label2 I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia
label2 I want that
label2 You can't have the whole brain
label2 So far, you have four
label2 OK. Take both the parasites
label2 They're yours
label2 Now we both have three...  Hey
label2 What, are you selling those
label2 Yes
label2 I'm selling some clothes
label2 So
label2 We each have three
label2 That's six
label2 I want bowel cancer
label2 <i>The girl had done her homework.</i>  No
label2 No
label2 That's your favorite too
label2 Tried to slip it by me, eh
label2 Look, we'll split it
label2 Take the first and third Sunday
label2 Deal
label2 Let's not make a big thing out of it
label2 Hey, Marla
label2 Marla
label2 Maybe we should exchange numbers
label2 Should we
label2 We might wanna switch nights
label2 Who are you
label2 Cornelius
label2 Rupert
label2 Any of the stupid names you give each night
label2 <i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>  <i>SFO
label2 LAX.</i>  <i>You wake up at O'Hare.</i>  <i>Dallas Fort Worth.</i>  <i>BWI.</i>  <i>Pacific
label2 Mountain
label2 Central
label2 Gain an hour.</i>  The checkin for that flight isn't for another two hours, sir
label2 <i>This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>  <i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>  <i>If you wake up at a different time, in a different place,</i>  <i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>  <i>Everywhere I travel,</i>  <i>tiny life.</i>  <i>Singleserving sugar and cream.</i>  <i>Single pat of butter.</i>  <i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>  <i>Shampooconditioner combos.</i>  <i>Samplepackage mouthwash
label2 My job was to apply the formula.</i>  The infant went through the windshield
label2 <i>A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>  <i>The rear differential locks up.</i>  The teenager's braces are stuck to the ashtray
label2 Might make a good antismoking ad
label2 <i>The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.</i>  <i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>  The father must have been huge
label2 See where the fat burned to the seat
label2 The polyester shirt
label2 Very modern art
label2 <i>Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.</i>  <i>Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.</i>  <i>Multiply the result by the average outofcourt settlement, C.</i>  <i>A x B x C</i>  equals X
label2 Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents
label2 You wouldn't believe
label2 A major one
label2 <i>Every time the plane banked too sharply on takeoff or landing,</i>  <i>I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.</i>  <i>Anything.</i>  <i>Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.</i>  "If you are seated in an emergency exit row  and would be unable or unwilling to perform the duties  listed on the safety card, please ask a flight attendant to reseat you.
label2 Wanna switch seats
label2 No
label2 I'm not sure I'm the man for that particularjob
label2 An exitdoor procedure at 30,000ft
label2 The illusion of safety
label2 Yeah
label2 I guess so
label2 You know why they put oxygen masks on planes
label2 Oxygen gets you high
label2 Suddenly you become euphoric, docile
label2 You accept your fate
label2 It's all right here
label2 Emergency water landing, 600mph
label2 Blank faces
label2 Calm as Hindu cows
label2 That's...  That's an interesting theory
label2 What do you do for a living
label2 Why
label2 So you can pretend you're interested
label2 OK.  You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh
label2 We have the exact same briefcase
label2 Soap
label2 Sorry
label2 I make and I sell soap
label2 Did you know if you mix gasoline and frozen orange juice, you can make napalm
label2 No, I did not
label2 Is that true
label2 That's right
label2 One can make all kinds of explosives with simple household items
label2 Really
label2 If one was so inclined
label2 Everything on a plane is singleserving...  Oh, I get it
label2 Very clever
label2 How's it working out for you
label2 What
label2 Being clever
label2 Keep it up, then
label2 Right up
label2 A question of etiquette
label2 As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch
label2 <i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>  <i>Airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.</i>   Was it ticking
label2 Sorry, throwers
label2 Baggage handlers
label2 But when a suitcase vibrates,  the throwers have got to call the police
label2 My suitcase was vibrating
label2 Nine times out of ten  it's an electric razor
label2 But... every once in a while  it's a dildo
label2 <i>We have to use the indefinite article, a dildo, never</i>  <i>your dildo.</i>  I don't own...  <i>I had everything in that suitcase
label2 My CK shirts.</i>  <i>My DKNYshoes
label2 My AX ties.</i>  <i>Never mind.</i>  Hey
label2 <i>Home was a condo on the 15th floor</i>  <i>of a filing cabinet for widows and professionals.</i>  <i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>  <i>A foot of concrete is important</i>  <i>when your nextdoor neighbor has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>  <i>Or when a blast of debris that used to be your personal effects</i>  <i>blows out of your windows and sails flaming into the night.</i>  <i>I suppose these things happen.</i>  There's... nothing up there
label2 You can't go into the unit
label2 Do you have somebody you can call
label2 <i>How embarrassing.</i>  <i>A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>  <i>The police later told me the pilot light might have gone out</i>  <i>letting out just a little bit of gas.</i>  <i>That gas could have filled the condo.</i>  <i>1700 square feet with high ceilings for days and days.</i>  <i>Then the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on.</i>  <i>Yeah?</i>  <i>I can hear you breathing...</i>  <i>If you ask me now, I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>  <i> Hello
label2 Who's this?</i>  <i> Tyler
label2 Who is this?</i>  We met... We met on the airplane
label2 We had the same suitcase
label2 The clever guy
label2 <i>Oh, yeah
label2 Right.</i>  I called a second ago
label2 <i> I'm at a payphone
label2 Yeah, I *69'd you
label2 You're not gonna believe this
label2 You know, it could be worse
label2 A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep and toss it out of a car
label2 I don't know
label2 When you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that's it
label2 That's the last sofa I'll need
label2 I had it all
label2 I had a stereo that was very decent
label2 A wardrobe that was getting very respectable
label2 I was close to being complete
label2 Shit, man
label2 Now it's all gone
label2 All gone
label2 Do you know what a duvet is
label2 A comforter
label2 It's a blanket
label2 Just a blanket
label2 Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is
label2 No
label2 What are we, then
label2 I dunno
label2 Right
label2 We're consumers
label2 We are byproducts of a lifestyle obsession
label2 Murder, crime, poverty
label2 These things don't concern me
label2 Rogaine
label2 Olestra
label2 Martha Stewart
label2 Fuck Martha Stewart
label2 She's polishing the brass on the Titanic
label2 It's all going down
label2 So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns
label2 I say stop being perfect
label2 I say let's evolve
label2 Let the chips fall where they may
label2 But that's me, and I could be wrong
label2 It's just stuff
label2 Fuck, you're right
label2 I don't smoke
label2 My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...  What
label2 The things you own end up owning you
label2 Do what you like, man
label2 Oh, it's late
label2 Hey, thanks for the beer
label2 I should find a hotel
label2 What
label2 A hotel
label2 Yeah
label2 Just ask, man
label2 What are you talking about
label2 Oh, God
label2 Three pitchers of beer and you still can't ask
label2 What
label2 Oh, hey
label2 No, no, no
label2 So just ask
label2 Cut the foreplay and just ask, man
label2 Would... Would that be a problem
label2 Is it a problem for you to ask
label2 Yeah
label2 Thanks
label2 I want you to do me a favor
label2 I want you to hit me as hard as you can
label2 What
label2 I want you to hit me as hard as you can
label2 <i>Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.</i>  <i>Tyler was a night person.</i>  While the rest of us slept, he worked
label2 A movie doesn't come all on one big reel
label2 It comes on a few
label2 Someone has to switch the projectors at the exact moment  that one reel ends and the next one begins
label2 You can see little dots come into the upper right corner of the screen
label2 In the industry, we call them cigarette burns
label2 That's the cue for a changeover
label2 He flips the projectors, movie keeps going and the audience has no idea
label2 Because it affords him interesting opportunities
label2 Like splicing a frame of pornography into family films
label2 Nobody knows that they saw it but they did
label2 Nice, big cock
label2 Even a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work
label2 <i>He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.</i>  Do not watch
label2 I cannot go when you watch
label2 Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque, he farted on meringues,  and as for the cream of mushroom soup...  Go ahead, tell 'em
label2 You get the idea
label2 You just want me to hit you
label2 Come on
label2 Why
label2 I don't know
label2 Never been in a fight
label2 You
label2 But that's a good thing
label2 I don't wanna die without any scars
label2 Come on
label2 Hit me, before I lose my nerve
label2 Oh, God
label2 This is crazy
label2 So go crazy
label2 Let it rip
label2 I don't know about this
label2 Who gives a shit
label2 Noone's watching
label2 What do you care
label2 This is crazy
label2 That's right
label2 Where
label2 Like, in the face
label2 This is so fucking stupid
label2 Motherfucker
label2 He hit me in the ear
label2 Well, Jesus, I'm sorry
label2 Why the ear, man
label2 I fucked it up
label2 No, that was perfect
label2 No, it's all right
label2 Right
label2 Hit me again
label2 No, you hit me
label2 We should do this again sometime
label2 Where's your car
label2 <i>I don't know how Tyler found that house</i>  <i>but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>  <i>It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.</i>  <i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>  <i>There was no lock on the front door from when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.</i>  <i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>  <i>I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.</i>  <i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>  Yep
label2 That's you
label2 That's me
label2 That's the toilet
label2 Yeah, thanks
label2 <i>What a shithole.</i>  <i>Nothing worked.</i>  <i>Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.</i>  <i>There were no neighbors
label2 Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>  <i>That fart smell of steam
label2 The hamstercage smell of wood chips.</i>  What have we here
label2 Hey, guys
label2 <i>Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.</i>  <i>By the end of the first month, I didn't miss TV.</i>  <i>I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.</i>  Can I be next
label2 All right, man
label2 Lose the tie
label2 What are you reading
label2 Listen to this
label2 It's an article written by an organ in the first person
label2 "I am Jack's medulla oblongata
label2 There's a whole series of these
label2 "I Am Jill's Nipples.
label2 "I Am Jack's Colon.
label2 "I Get Cancer
label2 I Kill Jack.
label2 <i>After fighting, everything else in life got the volume turned down.</i>  What
label2 <i> You could deal with anything
label2 Have you finished those reports?</i>  <i>If you could choose, who would you fight?</i>  I'd fight my boss, probably
label2 Yeah, why
label2 Who would you fight
label2 I don't know my dad
label2 I mean, I know him, but..
label2 He left when I was like, six years old
label2 Married this other woman and had some other kids
label2 He did this every six years
label2 He changes city and starts a new family
label2 My dad never went to college
label2 So it was real important that I go
label2 That sounds familiar
label2 Call him up longdistance and say, "Dad, now what?
label2 Same here
label2 Now I'm 25
label2 Make my yearly call again
label2 "Dad, now what?
label2 He says, "I dunno
label2 Get married.
label2 You can't get married
label2 We're a generation of men raised by women
label2 <i>Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>  <i>But every Saturday night, we were finding something out.</i>  <i>We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.</i>  <i>It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>  <i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>  <i>I should have been looking for a new condo or haggling with my insurance company.</i>  <i>I should have been upset about my nice flaming little shit.</i>  <i>But I wasn't.</i>  The premise of cybernetting an office is make things more efficient
label2 <i>Monday mornings, I just thought about next week.</i>  Can I get the icon in cornflower blue
label2 Absolutely
label2 Efficiency is priority No.1, people
label2 Because waste is a thief
label2 I showed this to my man here
label2 You liked it, didn't you
label2 Turn off the jukebox
label2 Lock the back
label2 <i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.</i>  Gentlemen
label2 The first rule of Fight Club is  you do not talk about Fight Club
label2 The second rule of Fight Club is  you do not talk about Fight Club
label2 Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,  the fight is over
label2 Fourth rule
label2 Only two guys to a fight
label2 Fifth rule
label2 One fight at a time, fellas
label2 No shirts
label2 No shoes
label2 Seventh rule
label2 Fights will go on as long as they have to
label2 And the eighth and final rule
label2 If this is your first night at Fight Club  you have to fight
label2 <i>You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.</i>  <i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>  <i>Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight,</i>  <i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>  <i>Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were outside of it.</i>  <i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time
label2 His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>  <i>After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.</i>  If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight
label2 Doesn't matter
label2 Who'd be tough
label2 Hemingway
label2 Shatner
label2 I'd fight William Shatner
label2 <i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>  <i>Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up.</i>  <i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>  <i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>  Is that what a man looks like
label2 Oh, selfimprovement is masturbation
label2 Now, selfdestruction..
label2 Excuse me
label2 Stop
label2 <i>When the fight was over, nothing was solved.</i>  <i>But nothing mattered.</i>  Cool
label2 <i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>  Hey, man
label2 How about next week
label2 How about next month?
label2 Irvine, you're in the middle
label2 <i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>  He fell down some stairs
label2 <i>Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>  OK. Any historical figure
label2 I'd fight Gandhi
label2 Good answer
label2 How about you
label2 Lincoln
label2 Big guy, big reach
label2 Skinny guys fight till they're burger
label2 Fuck
label2 Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart
label2 <i>Where have you been the last eight weeks?</i>  <i>Marla?</i>  <i> How did you find me
label2 You left a forwarding number.</i>  I haven't seen you at any support groups
label2 <i>We split 'em up
label2 That was the idea
label2 How do you know
label2 I cheated
label2 I found a new one
label2 Really
label2 It's for men only
label2 Like the testicle thing
label2 I've been going to Debtors Anonymous
label2 <i> They're really fuckedup people..
label2 I've got a stomach full of Xanax
label2 I took what was left of a bottle
label2 It might have been too much
label2 <i>Picture Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.</i>  This isn't a forreal suicide thing
label2 This is probably a cryforhelp thing
label2 So you're staying in tonight, then
label2 I'd been here for two months and his door was never closed.</i>  You won't believe this dream I had last night
label2 I can hardly believe anything about last night
label2 What are you doing here
label2 What
label2 This is my house
label2 What are you doing here
label2 Oh, you've got some fuckedup friends
label2 Limber, though
label2 Silly cooze
label2 Phone's off the hook
label2 Guess who's on the other end
label2 <i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>  <i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>  Do you think it'll live up to its name
label2 <i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>  <i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>  <i>Ten,</i>  <i>nine,... eight...</i>  <i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i>  <i>think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>  <i>Five,</i>  <i>four...</i>  Hang on
label2 Did I call you
label2 The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic
label2 Oh, don't worry
label2 It's not a threat to you
label2 Oh, fuck
label2 Somebody called the cops
label2 End of the hall
label2 She has lost faith in herself
label2 Miss Singer, let us help you
label2 She's a monster
label2 You have every reason to live
label2 She's infectious human waste
label2 Miss Singer
label2 Good luck trying to save her
label2 If I fall asleep,  I'm done for
label2 Unfuckingbelievable
label2 No, I didn't
label2 Never
label2 No
label2 You're not into her, are you
label2 God, not at all
label2 <i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>  Are you sure
label2 You can tell me
label2 Believe me, I'm sure
label2 <i> Put a gun to my head and spray my brains
label2 That's good.</i>  She's a predator posing as a house pet
label2 The shit that came out of this woman's mouth, I had never heard
label2 I haven't been fucked like that since grade school
label2 <i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>  <i>The other night, he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.</i>  Marla doesn't need a lover, just a caseworker
label2 Or a wash
label2 This isn't love, it's sport fucking
label2 <i>She invaded my support groups and now my home.</i>  Hey, hey
label2 Now, listen
label2 I can't have you talking to her about me
label2 Why would I...  Say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or anybody,... we're done
label2 You promise
label2 OK.   Yeah, I promise
label2 Promise
label2 I just said, I promise
label2 <i>If only I had wasted a few minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>  <i>none of this would have happened.</i>  Harder, yes
label2 Oh, harder, harder
label2 <i>I could have moved to another room.</i>  <i>On the third floor where I might not have heard them.</i>  <i>But I didn't.</i>   What are you doing
label2 Just going to bed
label2 Wanna finish her off
label2 No
label2 No, thank you
label2 Who were you talking to
label2 Shut up
label2 <i>I became the calm little center of the world.</i>  <i>I was the Zen master.</i>  <i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>  <i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>  Is that your blood
label2 You can't smoke in here
label2 Take the rest of the day off
label2 Come back Monday with some clean clothes
label2 Get yourself together
label2 <i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.</i>  <i>"Yes, these are bruises from fighting
label2 "</i>  <i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that
label2 This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.</i>  <i>We have some new information about the incident at your former condo.</i>  Yes
label2 I don't know if you're aware, but someone sprayed Freon into your frontdoor lock
label2 <i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>  No, I wasn't aware of that
label2 <i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>  Does this sound strange to you
label2 <i>Yes, sir, strange
label2 <i> Do you know what this means
label2 No, what does it mean?</i>  It means it was homemade
label2 I'm sorry
label2 This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir
label2 Whoever set this dynamite could have blown out your pilot light days before the explosion
label2 <i> The gas was just a detonator
label2 Who would go and do that?</i>  <i> I'll ask the questions
label2 <i>Excuse me
label2 Are you there?</i>  I am listening
label2 It's hard to know what to make of this
label2 Have you recently made enemies who might have access to homemade dynamite
label2 <i> Son, this is serious
label2 Yes, I know it's serious.</i>  <i> I mean that
label2 Yes, it's very serious.</i>  Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me
label2 That condo was my life
label2 OK
label2 I loved every stick of furniture in that place
label2 I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>  <i> Is this not a good time for you
label2 Just tell him you fucking did it!</i>  Tell him you blew it all up
label2 That's what he wants to hear
label2 Wait
label2 Are you saying that I'm a suspect?</i>  No
label2 I may need to talk to you, so you let me know if you're gonna leave town
label2 OK.</i>  <i>Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.</i>  <i>My parents pulled this exact same act for years.</i>  The condom is the glass slipper of our generation
label2 You slip one on when you meet a stranger
label2 You... dance all night
label2 Then you throw it away
label2 Not the stranger
label2 What
label2 I got this dress at a thrift store for $1
label2 It was worth every penny
label2 Someone loved it intensely  for one day
label2 Then tossed it
label2 Like a Christmas tree
label2 So special
label2 Then  bam
label2 It's on the side of the road
label2 Tinsel still clinging to it
label2 Like a sex crime victim
label2 Bound with electrical tape
label2 Well then, it suits you
label2 You can borrow it sometime
label2 <i> What
label2 You get rid of her
label2 Don't mention me.</i>  <i>I am six years old again, passing messages between parents.</i>   I really think it's time you left
label2 Don't worry, I'm leaving
label2 Not that we don't love your visits
label2 Gotta get off  Thanks
label2 Bye
label2 Gotta get off of this merrygoround  Gonna get, need to get...  Gotta get...  You kids
label2 Why do you still waste time with her
label2 I'll say this about Marla
label2 <i>At least she's trying to hit bottom.</i>  And I'm not
label2 Feathers up your butt do not make you a chicken
label2 Tonight... we make soap
label2 To make soap, first we render fat
label2 The salt balance has to be just right  so the best fat for soap comes from humans
label2 Wait, what is this place
label2 A liposuction clinic
label2 Pay dirt
label2 Richest, creamiest fat in the world
label2 No
label2 Don't pull it, don't pull it
label2 Oh, God
label2 As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface
label2 Like in Boy Scouts
label2 It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout
label2 Keep stirring
label2 Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin
label2 Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust, you've got dynamite
label2 Yeah, with enough soap, one could blow up just about anything
label2 <i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>  People found clothes got cleaner when washed at a certain point in the river
label2 You know why
label2 Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river
label2 Bodies burnt
label2 Water permeated the ashes to create lye
label2 The crucial ingredient
label2 Once it mixed with the melted body fat, a white soapy discharge crept into the river
label2 May I see your hand, please
label2 This is a chemical burn
label2 It will hurt more than any burn and it will leave a scar
label2 <i>Meditation worked for cancer, it could work now.</i>   Don't shut the pain out
label2 Oh, God
label2 The first soap was made from heroes' ashes, like the first monkey shot into space
label2 Without pain or sacrifice, we would have nothing
label2 <i>I tried not to think of the word searing of flesh.</i>  Stop it
label2 This is your pain, this is your burning hand
label2 No
label2 Don't deal with this the way those dead people do
label2 I get the point
label2 No
label2 You're feeling premature enlightenment
label2 It's the greatest moment of your life, and you're off somewhere else
label2 Shut up
label2 Our fathers were our models for God
label2 If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God
label2 Listen to me
label2 You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you
label2 He never wanted you
label2 This is not the worst thing that can happen
label2 We don't need Him
label2 Fuck damnation, fuck redemption
label2 We are God's unwanted children
label2 I'm getting water
label2 You can use water and make it worse or...   Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn
label2 Please let me up
label2 First, you have to give up
label2 First, you have to know, not fear,  know that some day, you're gonna die
label2 You don't know how this feels
label2 OK.  Congratulations
label2 You're one step closer to hitting the bottom
label2 <i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar.</i>  <i>God knows what they charged.</i>   This is the best soap
label2 Why, thank you, Susan
label2 <i>I'm halfasleep again
label2 I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>  "The second rule..." Is this yours
label2 Pretend you're me
label2 Make a managerial decision
label2 What would you do
label2 Well, I gotta tell you,  I'd be very, very careful who you talk to about that
label2 And this buttondown, Oxfordcloth psycho might just snap  and then stalk from office to office  with an Armalite AR10 carbine gaspowered semiautomatic weapon,  pumping round after round into colleagues and coworkers
label2 This might be someone you've known for years
label2 Someone very, very close to you
label2 <i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>  <i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>  Or maybe you shouldn't bring me every piece of trash you pick up
label2 Compliance and Liability
label2 My tit's gonna rot off
label2 Will you excuse me
label2 What do you mean
label2 I need you to check for a lump in my breast
label2 Go to a hospital
label2 I can't afford to waste money on a doctor
label2 Please
label2 <i>She didn't call Tyler
label2 I'm neutral in her book.</i>  That's nice
label2 Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines
label2 Where are they, exactly
label2 I'm alive and I'm in poverty
label2 Want any
label2 No, no
label2 Thanks for the thought
label2 What happened to your hand
label2 Oh, nothing
label2 Right there
label2 Feel anything
label2 Well, make sure
label2 OK, I'm pretty sure
label2 No, nothing
label2 Well, that's a relief
label2 Thank you
label2 No problem
label2 I wish I could return the favor
label2 I could check your prostate
label2 I think I'm OK.  Well, thanks, anyway
label2 Are we done
label2 Yeah, we're done
label2 See you... around
label2 Cornelius
label2 It's me
label2 Hey, Bob
label2 We all thought you were dead
label2 Still here
label2 How are you, Bob
label2 Better than I've ever been in my whole life
label2 Really
label2 Still remaining men together
label2 No, no
label2 Really, what is it
label2 Well..
label2 The first rule is, I'm not supposed to talk about it
label2 And the second rule is  I'm not supposed to talk about it
label2 And the third rule is...  Bob, Bob
label2 I'm a member
label2 That's fucking... fucking great
label2 I've never seen you there
label2 I go Tuesdays and Thursdays
label2 I go Saturday
label2 Yeah, hey, to both of us, right
label2 Have you heard about the guy that invented it
label2 Yeah, actually..
label2 Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution  and he sleeps only one hour a night
label2 He's a great man
label2 Do you know about Tyler Durden
label2 I didn't hurt you, did I
label2 Actually, you did
label2 <i>Fight Club.</i>  <i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>  <i>Our gift to the world.</i>  I look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces
label2 Shut up
label2 Which means a lot of people have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club
label2 I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived
label2 I see all this potential
label2 Goddamn it, an entire generation pumping gas
label2 Waiting tables
label2 Slaves with white collars
label2 Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes
label2 Working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need
label2 We're the middle children of history
label2 We have no Great War
label2 No Great Depression
label2 Our great war is a spiritual war
label2 We've all been raised on television to believe  that one day we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars
label2 But we won't
label2 And we're very, very pissed off
label2 Yeah
label2 First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...  Who are you
label2 Who am I
label2 There's a sign on the front that says Lou's Tavern
label2 I'm fucking Lou
label2 Who the fuck are you
label2 Tyler Durden
label2 Who told you motherfuckers that you could use my place
label2 Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone
label2 He don't own this place
label2 I do
label2 How much money's he getting for this
label2 There is no money
label2 Free to all
label2 Ain't that something
label2 Look, stupid fuck
label2 Hey
label2 You should join our club
label2 Did you hear what I just said
label2 You and your friend
label2 You hear me now
label2 No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou
label2 Still not getting it
label2 I got it, I got it
label2 Shit, I lost it
label2 Back
label2 All of you
label2 Ah, Lou
label2 Come on, man
label2 We really like this place
label2 Get it out
label2 Oh, yeah
label2 Is that fucking funny
label2 Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you
label2 Unbelievable
label2 You don't know where I've been, Lou
label2 Oh, my God
label2 Please let us keep it, Lou
label2 Please, Lou
label2 Fucking use the basement
label2 Christ
label2 I want your word, Lou
label2 On my mother's eyes
label2 Thanks, Lou
label2 We'll see you next week
label2 This week, each one of you has a homework assignment
label2 You're gonna go out
label2 You're gonna start a fight with a total stranger
label2 You're gonna start a fight  and you're gonna lose
label2 Hey
label2 Watch out, jackass
label2 Come on
label2 <i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>  Son of a bitch
label2 <i>Most people, normal people, do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>  Excuse me
label2 That's not necessary...  Jay
label2 Go call 911
label2 Put the hose down
label2 Stop it
label2 Stop it
label2 We need to talk
label2 With your constant absenteeism
label2 With your unpresentable appearance
label2 You're up for review
label2 I am Jack's complete lack of surprise
label2 Let's pretend
label2 You're the Department of Transportation, OK
label2 Someone informs you that this company  installs frontseat mounting brackets that failed collision tests,  brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,  and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive
label2 What then
label2 Are you threatening me
label2 You're fired
label2 I have a better solution
label2 Keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant
label2 In exchange for my salary,  my job will be never to tell people these things that I know
label2 I don't even have to come into the office
label2 I can do this job from home
label2 <i> Security
label2 I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>  What the hell are you doing
label2 Why would you do that
label2 Oh, my God
label2 No
label2 Please stop
label2 Oh, God, no
label2 Please
label2 No
label2 <i>For some reason, I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>  No
label2 Give me the paychecks, like I asked, and you won't ever see me again
label2 <i>Then, at our most excellent moment together...</i>  Thank God
label2 <i>Telephone, computer,</i>  <i>fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>  <i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>  <i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.</i>  <i>Now, the center of Fight Club became the two men fighting.</i>  <i>The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness.</i>  <i>Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel</i>  <i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>  <i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>  Thank you, sir
label2 <i>Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.</i>  <i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>   There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City
label2 Yeah, I heard
label2 There's one in Penns Grove too
label2 Did you start that one
label2 No, I thought you did
label2 No
label2 Stop for a second
label2 Hey, what are we doing
label2 What are we doing
label2 Homework assignment
label2 What kind
label2 Human sacrifice
label2 Is that a gun
label2 It's a gun
label2 What are you doing
label2 Don't fuck around
label2 Meet me in the back
label2 <i>On a long enough time line,</i>  <i>the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>  What are you doing
label2 Come on
label2 Hands behind your back
label2 Raymond K Hessel
label2 1320 SE Banning, Apartment A
label2 Small, cramped basement apartment
label2 How did you know
label2 Raymond
label2 You're going to die
label2 No
label2 Is that your mom and dad
label2 They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor
label2 Know why
label2 There'll be nothing left of your face
label2 Oh, come on
label2 An expired community college student ID
label2 What did you study, Raymond
label2 Stuff
label2 I asked you what you studied
label2 Biology, mostly
label2 Why
label2 I don't know
label2 What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?
label2 The question, Raymond, was what did you want to be
label2 Answer him, Raymond, Jesus
label2 Veterinarian
label2 Animals
label2 Yeah
label2 Animals and stuff
label2 Yeah, I got that
label2 So you need more schooling
label2 Too much school
label2 No, please...  You'd rather die here, on your knees, in the back of a convenience store
label2 Please, no
label2 Gonna check in on you
label2 I know where you live
label2 If you're not working to be a veterinarian in six weeks,  you will be dead
label2 Now run on home
label2 I feel ill
label2 Imagine how he feels
label2 Come on, this isn't funny
label2 What the fuck was the point of that?
label2 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K Hessel's life
label2 His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted
label2 <i>You had to give it to him.</i>  <i> Come on
label2 He had a plan.</i>  <i>And it started to make sense in a Tylersort of way.</i>  <i>No fear
label2 You're not the car you drive
label2 You're not the contents of your wallet
label2 You are the allsinging, alldancing crap of the world
label2 I'll be out of your way in a sec
label2 You don't have to go
label2 Whatever
label2 No, I mean..
label2 Yeah
label2 Wow, Chloe
label2 When did that happen
label2 Do you care
label2 I dunno
label2 Yeah, well..
label2 It was the smart move on her part
label2 Listen...  What are you getting out of all this
label2 What
label2 Why do you keep...  Is this making you happy
label2 Yeah, well, sometimes
label2 I don't know
label2 I don't understand
label2 Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person
label2 What do you get out of it
label2 No... That's not the same thing at all
label2 It's totally different with us
label2 Us
label2 What do you mean by us
label2 I'm sorry
label2 Do you hear this
label2 All that noise
label2 Hold on
label2 Don't change the subject
label2 I want to talk about this
label2 You're not talking about me, are you
label2 What
label2 Playing doctor
label2 What was going on there
label2 What are you talking about
label2 Nothing
label2 Nothing
label2 I don't think so
label2 Look at me
label2 What
label2 What is that?
label2 It's nothing
label2 Don't worry
label2 My God
label2 Who did this
label2 Guy or girl
label2 What do you care
label2 What do you care if I ask
label2 Leave me alone
label2 You're afraid to say
label2 Let me go
label2 Talk to me
label2 Let go of me
label2 This conversation  This conversation   is over
label2 is over
label2 Hey, this is getting a little old
label2 What is... What is all this
label2 What do you think
label2 Hey, why do we need bunk beds
label2 Hey
label2 Too young
label2 What's all that
label2 If the applicant is young, tell him he's too young
label2 Old, too old
label2 Fat, too fat
label2 If the applicant waits three days without food or shelter,  he may enter and begin training
label2 Training for what
label2 You think this is a game
label2 You're too young to train here, end of story
label2 Get the fuck out of here
label2 Bad news, friend
label2 It's not gonna happen
label2 Sorry if there was a misunderstanding
label2 Just... go away
label2 Go
label2 You're trespassing and I will have to call the police
label2 Don't you look at me
label2 Never
label2 Now get the fuck off my porch
label2 Get off my porch
label2 <i>Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>  I'm gonna go inside and I'm gonna get a shovel
label2 Yes, sir
label2 Two pair of black pants
label2 Yes, sir
label2 One pair black boots
label2 Black socks
label2 Yes, sir
label2 $300 personal burial money
label2 Yes, sir
label2 All right
label2 You're too old, fat man
label2 Get the fuck off my porch
label2 Bob
label2 Bob
label2 Like a monkey ready to be shot into space
label2 Space monkey
label2 Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good
label2 You are too fucking old, fatty
label2 Get out of here, the both of you
label2 You are not special
label2 You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake
label2 You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else
label2 <i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>  <i>We are the allsinging, alldancing crap of the world.</i>  <i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>  <i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>  <i>To what purpose?</i>  <i>For what greater good?</i>  <i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>  When he was like, "You are not yourjob",  I was like, "Yeah!
label2 Hey
label2 OK
label2 What's going on
label2 What are we celebrating
label2 Go on
label2 Hey
label2 Let me get that for you
label2 <i>Investigators are here
label2 The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>  <i>Could you tell us what you think has happened here?</i>  <i>We believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism in the city</i>  <i>somehow related to underground boxing clubs.</i>  <i>We will be coordinating a rigorous investigation.</i>  <i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs who just arrived on the scene</i>  <i> of a fouralarm fire that broke out...  She's hot.</i>  <i>Back to you in the studio.</i>   Yeah
label2 Yeah
label2 Holy shit
label2 Yeah
label2 What the fuck did you guys do
label2 <i>Arson investigators are on the premises...</i>  Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir
label2 It will take dedication and commitment and, most of all, cooperation
label2 Streets are safer now
label2 There is hope in the inner city
label2 I gotta take a piss
label2 These are the first steps in a long journey
label2 That is why we have created Project Hope
label2 Bob
label2 Project Hope will be ajoint effort  between the police and community leaders
label2 Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack
label2 Hi
label2 You're gonna call off your rigorous investigation
label2 You will publicly state there is no underground group or  these guys are gonna take your balls
label2 <i>They'll send one to the New York Times and one to the LA Times.</i>  Look
label2 The people you are after are the people you depend on
label2 We cook your meals
label2 We connect your calls
label2 We drive your ambulances
label2 We guard you while you sleep
label2 Do not fuck with us
label2 Ball check
label2 Let's go
label2 <i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>  Hey
label2 <i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i>  <i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>  <i>I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers</i>  <i>and smother those French beaches I'd never see.</i>  <i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>  Where did you go, psycho boy
label2 I felt like destroying something beautiful
label2 Get him to a fucking hospital
label2 Don't worry, Mr Durden
label2 Airport parking
label2 Long term
label2 After you, Mr Durden
label2 Something on your mind, dear
label2 No
label2 Yeah, why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem
label2 First rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions
label2 Why didn't you include me in the beginning
label2 Fight Club was the beginning
label2 We started Fight Club together
label2 Remember
label2 It's as much mine as it is yours
label2 Yeah
label2 Weren't we doing this together
label2 This does not belong to us
label2 We are not special
label2 Fuck that
label2 You should have told me
label2 Hey, Tyler
label2 What do you want?
label2 A statement of purpose
label2 Oh...  You decide your level of involvement
label2 I will
label2 I wanna know certain things first
label2 The first rule of Project Mayhem..
label2 I wanna know what you're thinking
label2 Fuck what you know
label2 Forget about what you think you know about life, friendship,  and especially about you and me
label2 What are you doing
label2 What do you wish you'd done before you died
label2 Paint a selfportrait
label2 Build a house
label2 And you
label2 Nothing
label2 Get in the right lane
label2 You have to know
label2 If you died now, how would you feel about your life
label2 I don't know
label2 Nothing good
label2 Come on
label2 Stop fucking around
label2 Tyler
label2 Jesus Christ
label2 Goddamn it
label2 Goddamn it
label2 Fuck you
label2 Fuck Marla
label2 I am sick of all your shit
label2 OK, man
label2 Quit screwing around
label2 Look at you
label2 Steer
label2 Look at you
label2 You're fucking pathetic
label2 Why
label2 What are you talking about
label2 Why do you think I blew up your condo
label2 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat
label2 It's not a goddamned seminar
label2 Stop trying to control everything and just let go
label2 Let go
label2 All right
label2 Fine
label2 We've just had a nearlife experience
label2 In the world I see,  you're stalking elk through the Grand Canyon forests  around the ruins of Rockefeller Center
label2 You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life
label2 You'll climb the thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower
label2 Feel better, champ
label2 <i>And then...</i>  Tyler
label2 <i>..Tyler was gone.</i>  <i>Was I asleep?</i>  <i>Had I slept?</i>  You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...  <i>The house had become a living thing.</i>  <i>Wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.</i>  <i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>  <i>Planet Tyler.</i>  <i>I had to hug the walls.</i>  <i>Trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>  You shouldn't be smoking in here
label2 You know how much ether is here
label2 <i>Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.</i>  Hang on a second
label2 It's under control, sir
label2 Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not..
label2 Right... OK.  <i>I'm all alone.</i>  <i>My father dumped me
label2 Tyler dumped me.</i>  <i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>  <i>What comes next in Project Mayhem only Tyler knows.</i>  <i>The second rule is you do not ask questions.</i>  Get the fuck away from me
label2 Get the fuck away
label2 The Paper Street Soap Company
label2 Can I come in
label2 He's not here
label2 What
label2 Tyler isn't here
label2 Tyler's gone
label2 Get some help
label2 Make some fucking room
label2 What happened
label2 What happened
label2 We were on assignment
label2 Destroy a piece of corporate art...  Operation Latte Thunder
label2 Go
label2 ..and trash a franchise coffee bar
label2 We had it all worked out, sir
label2 It went smooth until...  Police
label2 Freeze
label2 They shot Bob
label2 They shot him in the head
label2 Fucking pigs
label2 Those motherfuckers
label2 You morons
label2 What did you think was gonna happen?
label2 OK, quick
label2 Get rid of the evidence
label2 We gotta get rid of this body
label2 Bury him
label2 Take him to the garden and bury him
label2 Come on, people, let's go
label2 Get the fuck off
label2 What are you talking about
label2 This isn't fucking evidence
label2 This is a person
label2 He's my friend and you're not burying him in the garden
label2 He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir
label2 This is Bob
label2 Sir, in..
label2 Now, you listen to me
label2 Robert Paulsen
label2 He's a man  and he's dead now because of us
label2 Do you understand that
label2 I understand
label2 In death, a member of Project Mayhem  has a name
label2 His name... is Robert Paulsen
label2 His name is Robert Paulsen
label2 Come on, guys
label2 Please
label2 Stop it
label2 His name is Robert Paulsen
label2 This is all over with
label2 Get the fuck out of here
label2 No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit
label2 I need to see you...  <i>I went to all the cities on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.</i>  <i>I didn't know how or why, but I could look at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>  <i>I'm looking for Tyler Durden
label2 It's very important that I talk to him.</i>  I wish I could help you,  sir
label2 Hey
label2 Taxi
label2 Look at my face
label2 I'm a member
label2 Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler
label2 I'm not exposed to bespeak any such information to you  nor would I, even if I had said information at this juncture,... be able
label2 I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
label2 <i>Tyler had been busy... setting up franchises all over the country.</i>  <i>Was I asleep
label2 Had I slept?</i>  <i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>   We've just heard the stories
label2 What kind of stories
label2 Nobody knows what he looks like
label2 That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard
label2 Is it true about Fight Club in Miami
label2 Is Mr Durden building an army
label2 Welcome back, sir
label2 How have you been
label2 Is this a test, sir
label2 No
label2 This is not a test
label2 You were in here last Thursday
label2 You were standing where you are now, asking how good security is
label2 It's tight as a drum, sir
label2 Who do you think I am
label2 Are you sure this isn't a test
label2 No, this is not a test
label2 You're Mr Durden
label2 You're the one who gave me this
label2 <i>Please return your seat backs to their full upright and locked position.</i>  <i> Yeah
label2 Done what?</i>  Had sex
label2 What kind of stupid question is that
label2 <i> Is this a trick
label2 No
label2 I need to know...</i>  You wanna know if I think we were just having sex or making love
label2 Is that what you're calling it?</i>  Just answer the question
label2 Did we do it or not?
label2 You fuck me, then snub me
label2 You love me, you hate me
label2 You're sensitive, then you turn into an asshole
label2 <i>We just lost cabin pressure.</i>  What did you just say
label2 What is wrong with you
label2 Say my name
label2 Tyler Durden
label2 You fucking freak
label2 I'm coming over
label2 You broke your promise
label2 Jesus, Tyler
label2 You fucking talked to her about me
label2 What the fuck is going on
label2 I asked you for one thing
label2 One simple thing
label2 Why do people think that I'm you
label2 Answer me
label2 Answer me
label2 I think you know
label2 No, I don't
label2 Yes, you do
label2 Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me
label2 I don't know
label2 You got it
label2 No
label2 Do not fuck with us
label2 Say it
label2 Because...  Say it
label2 Because we're the same person
label2 <i>We are the allsinging, alldancing crap.</i>   I don't understand this
label2 You wanted a way to change your life
label2 All the ways you wish you could be,  that's me
label2 I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck
label2 I am smart, capable and, most importantly,  I'm free in all the ways that you are not
label2 Oh, no
label2 Tyler went away
label2 What
label2 This is crazy
label2 People do it every day
label2 They talk to themselves
label2 They see themselves as they'd like to be
label2 They don't have the courage you have to just run with it
label2 You still wrestle with it, so sometimes you're still you
label2 We should do this again sometime
label2 At times, you imagine you're watching me
label2 Little by little, you're just letting yourself become  Tyler Durden
label2 You are not yourjob or how much money you have
label2 You have a house
label2 Rented in your name
label2 You have jobs, a life
label2 You work nights because you can't sleep
label2 Or you stay up and make soap
label2 Technically, you are
label2 It's all the same to her
label2 Oh, my God
label2 Now you see our dilemma
label2 She knows too much
label2 What... What are you saying
label2 This is bullshit
label2 You are insane
label2 No
label2 We simply do not have time for this crap
label2 <i>It's called a changeover.</i>  <i>The movie goes on</i>  <i>and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>   Sir
label2 Are you checking out
label2 Yeah
label2 Can you initial this list of phone calls
label2 When were these made
label2 Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning
label2 <i>Have I been going to bed earlier every night
label2 <i>D茅j脿 vu all over again.</i>  With enough soap, one could blow up anything
label2 Oh, my God
label2 <i> 1888.  Who am I calling?</i>  <i>1888 Franklin
label2 This is maintenance
label2 <i>Yes
label2 Can I help you?</i>  <i> Hello
label2 Yeah, yeah.</i>  I need to talk to your supervisor right away
label2 <i> Speaking
label2 OK, listen to me.</i>  Something terrible is about to happen to your building
label2 Don't worry about us, sir
label2 We're solid.</i>  <i>2160.</i>  Marla
label2 Marla
label2 Hey, wait
label2 Wait
label2 Marla
label2 Marla
label2 Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom
label2 They almost broke my arm
label2 This needs a tremendous act of faith on your part, but hear me out
label2 Here comes an avalanche of bullshit
label2 A little more faith than that
label2 I don't wanna hear anything you have to say
label2 You have every right to be..
label2 I'll just have a coffee, thanks
label2 Anything you order is free of charge, sir
label2 Why is it free of charge
label2 Whatever
label2 I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie
label2 Clean food, please
label2 In that case, may I advise against the clam chowder
label2 Thank you
label2 You got about 30 seconds
label2 I know I've been acting very strange, OK
label2 I know it seems there's two sides to me...  Two sides
label2 You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass
label2 I know
label2 What
label2 The nature of our relationship wasn't clear  to me for reasons I won't go into
label2 Whatever
label2 No, no
label2 Fifteen seconds, please
label2 Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth
label2 I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry
label2 You do
label2 I really do
label2 I care about you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you because of me
label2 What
label2 You need to leave town for a while
label2 Get out of any major city
label2 Just go camping...  You're an insane person
label2 No
label2 No
label2 Shut up
label2 You're not safe
label2 Shut up
label2 I really tried
label2 I know you did
label2 You're smart, funny
label2 You're spectacular in bed
label2 But  you're intolerable
label2 Deepseated problems for which you should seek professional help
label2 I know, and I'm sorry
label2 You're sorry, I'm sorry
label2 Everyone's sorry
label2 I can't do this any more
label2 I can't
label2 And I won't
label2 You can't leave, Marla
label2 You're not safe
label2 Marla, you don't understand
label2 Marla, I am trying to protect you
label2 Let go
label2 I don't ever wanna see you again
label2 That's fine..
label2 Here, wait right here
label2 Hold it right there
label2 Take this money and get on this bus
label2 Shut up
label2 Please get on the bus
label2 Please get on the bus
label2 Why are you doing this
label2 They think you're a threat
label2 I can't explain it now, just trust me
label2 If I know where you are, you won't be safe
label2 Remember, stay out of major cities
label2 Tyler
label2 You're the worst thing that ever happened to me
label2 Hello
label2 I need you to arrest me
label2 In the metropolitan area, we had probably 200 members
label2 Chapters have sprung up in five or six other major cities already
label2 This is a tightlyregimented organization  with many cells capable of operating independent of central leadership
label2 Go to the house, OK
label2 That's our headquarters
label2 In the back, buried in the garden,  you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen
label2 In the basement, you're gonna find some bathtubs  that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin
label2 I believe the plan is to blow up  the headquarters of these credit card companies  and the TRW building
label2 Why these buildings
label2 Why credit card companies
label2 If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero
label2 Keep him talking
label2 I need to make a phone call
label2 I really admire what you're doing
label2 You're a brave man to order this
label2 You're a genius, sir
label2 Don't fight
label2 It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden
label2 It will set an example
label2 You're making a big mistake
label2 I'm not Tyler Durden
label2 You told us you'd say that too
label2 All right
label2 I am Tyler Durden
label2 Listen to me
label2 We're aborting this mission now
label2 You said you would definitely say that
label2 Are you fucking out of your minds
label2 You're police officers
label2 Is somebody timing this
label2 Shit
label2 Some of this information checks out
label2 Be right there
label2 Hey, wait
label2 I got him
label2 Sir, we have to do this
label2 Stop fighting
label2 Where's the rubber band
label2 Get away from me
label2 Back up
label2 Face down on the floor right now
label2 Get down on the floor
label2 The first person that comes out of this door  gets a lead salad
label2 Get away
label2 Stay away
label2 <i>I ran.</i>  <i>I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>  <i>Then I ran some more.</i>  What the fuck are you doing
label2 Running around in your underpants
label2 No
label2 I know what's going on here
label2 Come on, then
label2 I got us a great place to watch from
label2 Oh, Christ
label2 Now what are you doing
label2 I'm stopping this
label2 Why
label2 The greatest thing you've ever done
label2 I can't let this happen
label2 Since when is Project Mayhem about murder
label2 The buildings are empty
label2 We're not killing anyone
label2 We're setting 'em free
label2 Bob is dead
label2 You wanna make an omelette, you gotta break some eggs
label2 No
label2 You're not even there
label2 I wouldn't do that
label2 Not unless you knew which wires were what
label2 If you know, I know
label2 Oh, heavens, no
label2 Not the green one
label2 Pull any one but the green one
label2 I asked you not to do that
label2 Fuck
label2 Tyler, get away from the van
label2 Tyler, I'm not kidding
label2 Goddamn it
label2 OK.  You are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend  near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin
label2 Come on
label2 Don't go
label2 What?
label2 Three minutes
label2 This is it
label2 The beginning
label2 <i>I think this is about where we came in.</i>  Do you have a speech for the occasion
label2 I'm sorry
label2 Flashback humor
label2 It's getting exciting now
label2 Two and a half
label2 Think of everything we've accomplished
label2 One step closer to economic equilibrium
label2 Why is she here
label2 Tying up loose ends
label2 I beg you, please don't do this
label2 I'm not doing this
label2 <i> We are doing this
label2 This is what we want
label2 Right
label2 Except you is meaningless now
label2 We have to forget about you
label2 You're a voice in my head
label2 You're a voice in mine
label2 Why can't I get rid of you
label2 You need me
label2 I don't
label2 I really don't any more
label2 I didn't create some loser alter ego to make me feel better
label2 Take some responsibility
label2 I do
label2 So, please, I'm begging you, please call this off
label2 Have I ever let us down
label2 How far have you come because of me?
label2 As always, I will carry you kicking and screaming  and in the end you will thank me
label2 Tyler
label2 Tyler
label2 I'm grateful to you
label2 For everything that you've done for me
label2 But this is too much
label2 I don't want this
label2 Your shitjob back
label2 Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms
label2 I won't do it
label2 This can't be happening
label2 It's already done, so shut up
label2 60 seconds till CRI
label2 I can figure this out
label2 This isn't even real
label2 You're not real, that gun... That gun isn't even in your hand
label2 The gun's in my hand
label2 It doesn't change a thing
label2 Why do you wanna put a gun to your head
label2 Not my head, Tyler
label2 Our head
label2 Interesting
label2 Hey
label2 It's you and me
label2 Friends
label2 Tyler,  I want you to really listen to me
label2 OK.  My eyes are open
label2 What's that smell
label2 Oh, no
label2 What's going on
label2 Oh, my God
label2 Are you... Are you all right, sir
label2 What happened
label2 Nothing, it's no problem
label2 No, no, no, sir
label2 He's not kidding
label2 You look awful
label2 I'm fine
label2 Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine
label2 Stop it
label2 Let her go
label2 Christ Almighty
label2 You
label2 Leave her with me
label2 Are you sure
label2 Yes, I'm sure
label2 You fucker
label2 What kind of sick fucking game are you playing at?
label2 Yeah, I know
label2 What happened
label2 Don't ask
label2 You're shot
label2 Yes, I'm shot
label2 Oh, my God
label2 I can't believe he's standing
label2 Who did this
label2 I did, actually
label2 Find some gauze
label2 You shot yourself
label2 Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me
label2 You met me at a very strange time in my life
label2 ﻿1 When I think of my wife..
label2 I always think of her head
label2 I picture cracking her lovely skull...  Unspooling her brains..
label2 Trying to get answers
label2 The primal questions of any marriage
label2 "What are you thinking?
label2 "What have we done to each other?
label2 His majesty prefers not to be moistened
label2 I got you a present
label2 I hated this game
label2 You loved it
label2 You loved it
label2 Thank you
label2 Can you pour me a bourbon
label2 What's up, jitters
label2 Well, if you're not going to talk, I'm gonna have to fill the silence...  With another excruciating story by margo dunne
label2 I like that one
label2 Or how about the time I saw that woman who looked exactly like my friend Monica
label2 But it wasn't Monica
label2 Who was also named Monica
label2 Made it kind of interesting
label2 It's great
label2 I'm just having a bad day
label2 It's our anniversary
label2 Five years
label2 Five
label2 That came fast
label2 And furious
label2 I met a boy
label2 A great, sweet, gorgeous, coolass guy
label2 Excuse me, miss
label2 I just want you to be careful...  Where you put down that monkbrewed Belgian wheat beer...  Because the party's down to three beast lights and a bottle of pucker
label2 It might attract some desperate characters
label2 It could
label2 They already relieved me of my artisanal meat platter
label2 Finally, someone tells me how to pronounce that word
label2 "Meat"
label2 Yes, "meat.
label2 One syllable
label2 Whose beer am I about to drink
label2 Don't tell me
label2 Let's see, who's your type
label2 I don't see you sitting quietly..
label2 Uhoh
label2 Is that him
label2 Ironic hipster, so selfaware, he makes everything a joke
label2 What type are you
label2 Cornfed, saltoftheearth Missouri guy
label2 Cute
label2 Native new yorker
label2 The world ends at the Hudson
label2 What's your name
label2 Amy
label2 Well, Amy, who are you
label2 B, I'm a moderately influential warlord
label2 C, I write personality quizzes for magazines
label2 Your hands are far too delicate for real scrimshaw work...  And I happen to be a charter subscriber to middling warlord weekly..
label2 So I'd recognize you
label2 I'm gonna go with "c."  And you
label2 Who are you
label2 I'm the guy to save you from all this awesomeness
label2 So, you write for a men's magazine
label2 No
label2 It's what to wear, what to drink
label2 How to bullshit
label2 Never with you
label2 Ha, ha
label2 Why
label2 I think it's your chin
label2 My chin
label2 Yeah, it's quite villainous
label2 Okay, how's this
label2 A hundred percent true, no bullshit
label2 Okay
label2 We all move to New York...  And we end up living in these little cubby holes, and that's not it
label2 You have to see this
label2 Hey
label2 Hey
label2 I have to kiss you now
label2 Is that right
label2 I can't let you go through a sugar storm unkissed
label2 Wait a second
label2 Nick dunne..
label2 I really like you
label2 So, is Amy gonna do one of those anniversary...  Treasure hunts
label2 You mean the forced march designed to prove...  What an oblivious and uncaring asshole her husband is
label2 Wow
label2 I don't remember the point
label2 Spin
label2 What was the clue last year she got so mad about
label2 "When your poor Amy has a cold...  "This dessert just must be sold.
label2 The answer
label2 I still don't know the answer, go
label2 A few years ago, you'd have known
label2 A few years ago, it was fun
label2 She got me a beautiful notebook
label2 Told me to go write my novel
label2 What did you get her
label2 She'd never flown a kite
label2 Okay
label2 Anyway
label2 Year four, flowers
label2 She led me outside to the dying rosebush in the backyard
label2 Yeah
label2 Wood
label2 So, what did you get her
label2 There's no good gift for wood
label2 I know
label2 "There's some wood for you, bitch.
label2 The bar
label2 Why, yes
label2 Hang on one second
label2 Hey, it's watchful Wally
label2 What's going on
label2 Thanks very much
label2 All right, byebye
label2 Hey, buddy
label2 What are you doing out here
label2 Thanks, Walt
label2 Ame
label2 Amy
label2 Come on in
label2 Hey
label2 Mister dunne
label2 Hi
label2 I'm detective Rhonda boney
label2 We understand there are concerns about your wife
label2 And I came home to this
label2 Now, I don't panic easily..
label2 But it's weird, right
label2 Mind if we look around
label2 Please
label2 Two years in September
label2 We used to live in New York
label2 City
label2 Yeah, I was a writer
label2 We were both writers
label2 Why did you all move back here
label2 My mom got sick
label2 She's dead
label2 I'm so sorry
label2 What do you do now, for work
label2 My sister margo and I own the bar downtown
label2 Oh, the bar
label2 Love the name
label2 Very meta
label2 Pretty things
label2 Stay
label2 My office, here
label2 Date night
label2 It's our anniversary
label2 It's a guest bedroom, there
label2 Cat's room on the end
label2 I checked up here
label2 This is my wife's office
label2 Amy's office
label2 Wow
label2 Impressive gal
label2 Yeah
label2 I loved these books
label2 Wait a minute
label2 Your wife is amazing Amy
label2 Yeah
label2 She is
label2 AmazingfuckingAmy is getting fucking married
label2 That's how the night started
label2 With me, regular, flawed, real Amy, jealous, as always, of the golden child
label2 Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy, who's getting fucking married
label2 When I was 10, I quit cello
label2 In the next book, amazing Amy became a prodigy
label2 Did you play volleyball
label2 She made varsity
label2 When did you have a dog
label2 Puddles made her more relatable
label2 Wow
label2 But they really can be assholes
label2 Nick
label2 Sir
label2 Hey, thanks for coming, man
label2 No problem
label2 Hey, sweetheart
label2 Big night for your mom
label2 It would mean so much if you would talk to a few reporters...  Bloggers, give them a little Amy color
label2 We can't stay long
label2 Fantastic
label2 This is why I have my brownstone
label2 My trust fund
label2 I know I can't complain
label2 Your parents literally plagiarized your childhood
label2 No, they improved upon it, and then peddled it to the masses
label2 I thought you were gonna wear white to match the wedding theme
label2 I know how this ends
label2 Don't tell me
label2 You're very cute, Nick
label2 Amy, you know what would make dad's night
label2 I'm on it
label2 I love having strangers pick at my scabs
label2 I'm curious whether..
label2 It's difficult for you to see amazing Amy heading down the aisle
label2 Because it's my understanding you are not married
label2 Correct
label2 Amazing Amy has always been one step ahead of me
label2 Excuse me
label2 I'm sorry, I just have a few questions
label2 It's you
label2 I'm here in a strictly journalistic capacity
label2 Two magical years
label2 Two magical years
label2 In the course of that time, you've had the opportunity...  To perform such gracious gestures as...  Not correcting Nick when he pronounced "quinoa" as "kweenoa.
label2 An understandable mistake
label2 He thinks velveeta is a cheese
label2 You also manage to appear shocked and delighted..
label2 When Nick's elderly mother breaks into an impromptu rendition...  Of New York, New York, every time she sees you
label2 You also bought Nick his very first pair of scissors
label2 And matching stapler
label2 Amy elliott, you are more than amazing
label2 You are brilliant, yet entirely unsnobby
label2 You challenge me
label2 And, fun fact for the readers...  You have a worldclass vagina
label2 My colleagues tell me that you are not yet married
label2 Is that correct
label2 I'm not
label2 And then..
label2 The night wasn't so bad anymore
label2 And it's done
label2 Crossed off the list
label2 But given the scene at your house...  And given our spike in violent crime of late...  We are gonna take this very, very seriously
label2 Good
label2 We've got forensics over at your place
label2 You got somewhere to stay
label2 I could stay at my sister's
label2 Okay
label2 We will organize searches, put up flyers
label2 We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow
label2 You're having a press conference
label2 I wanna get the word out, right
label2 Yeah, it's just all of a sudden, I feel like I'm on a law & order episode
label2 But, that said, do you wanna wait and call a lawyer
label2 Absolutely not
label2 I just wanna help
label2 So, you and Amy have been here two years
label2 You tend bar..
label2 I own the bar
label2 No kids
label2 Not yet
label2 So, what does Amy do most days
label2 I don't know
label2 She keeps busy
label2 Doing what
label2 She's a voracious reader
label2 Well, days can get long
label2 I know a few housewives, that evening glass of wine starts coming at noon
label2 Or prescription pills
label2 Nice lady
label2 Got her teeth kicked in over some oxycontin
label2 Ever since that mall went bust, half the town is out of work
label2 We cannot keep up with the drug violence
label2 I'm pretty sure that's not it
label2 No, not really
label2 No friends
label2 She was very close with my mom, before she passed away
label2 You know, we have a pretty serious homeless problem..
label2 In our neighborhood
label2 We'll look into that
label2 You got to the bar around 11:00 today
label2 Where were you before that
label2 Just to cross that out
label2 Well, I was home
label2 I went to Sawyer beach and read the news
label2 Did you visit with anyone there
label2 I kind of go to Sawyer beach for the solitude
label2 So, your wife has no friends here
label2 Is she kinda standoffish
label2 Ivy league
label2 Rubs people the wrong way
label2 She's got very high standards
label2 Type a
label2 That can make you crazy if you're not like that
label2 You seem pretty laidback
label2 Speaking of which, Amy's blood type
label2 God, I don't know
label2 I'd have to look it up at the house
label2 You don't know if she has friends, you don't know what she does all day...  And you don't know your wife's blood type
label2 Sure you all are married
label2 Where are her folks
label2 New York
label2 Yeah
label2 Can they get here time for this press conference tomorrow
label2 I have no idea
label2 I haven't talked to them
label2 You haven't called your wife's parents yet
label2 You can't get a signal in this building
label2 I've been in here talking to you
label2 Now
label2 Fine
label2 Should I know my wife's blood type
label2 I apologize, marybeth
label2 I didn't know what was going on
label2 Now I'm at the station...  And the cops are at the house, and it's serious and I'm calling you
label2 There's a lot of things that are being juggled right now
label2 I'm standing right next to detective Rhonda boney...  Who's the lead investigator on this and she's...  My motherinlaw would like to speak with you
label2 This is detective boney
label2 I wanna go home
label2 I don't wanna be here
label2 I wanna go home
label2 Dad
label2 What's going on
label2 Really
label2 You're Nick dunne
label2 We've been trying to get a hold of you all afternoon
label2 My wife is missing
label2 Bitch
label2 Your father wandered out of comfort hill after lunch
label2 We found him walking route 79, disoriented
label2 We've been trying to call you for the last..
label2 I don't get a cell signal in this building
label2 Sir, please don't take that tone with me
label2 Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch
label2 Dad, stop
label2 I think that would be wise
label2 Thanks
label2 This voice mailbox is currently full
label2 Fuck
label2 Get your fucking hands off me
label2 Thanks
label2 Everyone told us and told us and told us..
label2 And compromise and more work
label2 "Abandon all hope, ye who enter.
label2 "When young Amy's hope did wane...  "She wandered here..."  Well, it's not true
label2 Not for me and Nick
label2 "...In search of Jane.
label2 It's just good
label2 Austen
label2 You were an alienated teen and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you
label2 Look at that
label2 You naughty minx
label2 Well, technically, we are supposed to fuck at the next stop
label2 Yeah, in keeping with tradition
label2 God bless Jane Austen
label2 I'm enthusiastic
label2 Look at that
label2 It's confirmed by the..
label2 Year two
label2 We had that joke that our sex was too good for ordinary
label2 So, these are 2,000 threadcount...  we're so cute
label2 I wanna punch us in the face
label2 That's pretty great
label2 I mean, that is pretty great
label2 I don't need a lawyer
label2 Here, I'll do this
label2 Well, did they ask personal stuff about Amy
label2 What did you say
label2 I said she was complicated
label2 Nick
label2 Everyone knows "complicated" is code for "bitch.
label2 God
label2 I feel sick
label2 Thanks
label2 It seems like the kind of thing that would happen to Amy
label2 She always attracts...  drama
label2 You can say it
label2 It's just me and you
label2 Doesn't mean I don't care about her
label2 Detective
label2 Excuse me
label2 I'm noelle hawthorne
label2 I'm Amy's best friend
label2 Well, great
label2 Where do you live, noelle
label2 1032
label2 Wonderful
label2 I would love to talk to you
label2 Can I come by in half an hour
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I got guys on the clock in here
label2 But you give me 30 minutes
label2 But that's usually bath time
label2 Well, we'll talk in between shampoos
label2 So, what do you got
label2 It was definitely blood spatter you saw in the kitchen
label2 Not that weird, but that is awfully high
label2 So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep
label2 Well, okay
label2 Interesting
label2 House is rented in her name
label2 Car's in her name
label2 Credit cards, utilities, phone bill, all in her name
label2 Even his bar's in her name
label2 No
label2 But it is humiliating
label2 What you got
label2 It's with her unmentionables
label2 Well, we have our first clue
label2 I have to take a shower
label2 No, don't
label2 You wanna look like you've been up all night
label2 Hey, be careful today, okay
label2 That's a weird thing to say
label2 Well, when you're upset, you bottle up
label2 Or else you swing into your momma'sboy charm offensive and that can feel glib
label2 Perfect
label2 Okay
label2 Just be..
label2 Myself
label2 Buy your tickets at the wing hut or local tristate tire stores
label2 Your inlaws made it
label2 Hi, rand
label2 Hey, man
label2 I'm detective boney
label2 Margo
label2 We played tennis yesterday, Nick
label2 I just can't get over it
label2 I knew you never should have moved back here
label2 We didn't have a lot of choice

label2 Yeah, definitely
label2 And we've had instances...   Where things got..
label2 Scary
label2 Yeah, I know all about desi collings
label2 He was obsessed
label2 He attempted suicide after Amy broke up with him sophomore year
label2 We had to file a restraining order
label2 This would be high school
label2 But he recently moved to St. Louis
label2 That's just two hours away
label2 To be fair, he is from St. Louis
label2 We also have Tommy O'Hara
label2 She broke up with him, he got very physical
label2 She filed charges
label2 Sexual assault, threat, battery, what
label2 I only know it was bad
label2 I didn't know this
label2 Okay
label2 Thank you
label2 Anything more recent
label2 Not that I know of
label2 You got a minute
label2 Imagine our confusion
label2 A missing persons case...  And in your wife's dressing room, we find an envelope marked "clue.
label2 That's for our anniversary
label2 My wife does these treasure hunts
label2 I'm hoping you can tell me what this means
label2 You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt
label2 It'll help me track Amy's movements before she disappeared
label2 Of course
label2 "Although this spot couldn't be tighter...  "It's a cozy room for my favorite writer.
label2 I know this one
label2 Although this spot couldn't be any tighter..
label2 It's a cozy room for my favorite writer
label2 Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two
label2 Well, well
label2 What does it say
label2 Clue two
label2 "You'll be the spy, and I'll be his lover
label2 "Let's head on over...  "To the little brown house
label2 These yours
label2 No
label2 But you read the first clue
label2 Randy Professor, naughty student
label2 Me and my ex just swapped cards
label2 Where's this little brown house
label2 I have no idea
label2 Hello
label2 Nicholas dunne
label2 My wife's first pet
label2 Is this necessary
label2 It's... it's..
label2 It's "puddles," right
label2 Or is it "poodles?
label2 Hello, stranger
label2 Fancy meeting you here
label2 It's your dad's house, right
label2 Are you following me
label2 Like you said, it's my dad's house
label2 I come by once a week, make sure the place hasn't burned down
label2 But it looks okay
label2 I'll walk you out
label2 You know..
label2 From the clue
label2 Nope
label2 Still blue
label2 Picture me, I'm a girl who's very, very bad
label2 I need to be punished, and by "punished," I mean "had.
label2 It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five
label2 Bitch
label2 Add one recession...  Subtract two jobs
label2 It's surprisingly effective
label2 Promise me we'll never be like them
label2 Like who
label2 All those awful couples we know
label2 Husbands who treat their wives like the highway patrol...  To be outfoxed and avoided
label2 I think I'm gonna be laid off
label2 We're in a recession
label2 If it happens, we'll deal with it
label2 I'll probably be next
label2 We have each other
label2 You are exceptional
label2 My turn
label2 That's terrible
label2 And they need to borrow from my trust fund
label2 How much
label2 Almost a million
label2 This is where you say, "everything else is background noise.
label2 Amy, if you're laid off...  And I'm laid off..
label2 I said I'd do it
label2 Without talking to me
label2 Well, it's..
label2 Your call
label2 Their money, technically
label2 You're right
label2 Everything else is just background noise
label2 Hey
label2 Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks
label2 Laptoping
label2 I see
label2 You can give your parents $879,000 without talking to me..
label2 But God forbid I buy a video game without getting your permission
label2 You don't trust me
label2 You don't trust my judgment
label2 You certainly don't trust my intention
label2 What are you talking about
label2 That's the basic tenet of a prenup, isn't it
label2 Why are you throwing that in my face again
label2 Because it's easy to throw
label2 Nick, I don't get it
label2 The nagging shrew
label2 The controlling bitch
label2 I'm your wife
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I just don't know how to do this
label2 I've never not had a job
label2 You'll get another job
label2 Hi, go
label2 What
label2 Hold on
label2 What
label2 And suddenly..
label2 Okay, tell me what's wrong
label2 Bless you, Nick
label2 Father
label2 Hey, tom
label2 Nick, good to see you
label2 Good to see you
label2 Hey, guys, hey
label2 Jodie
label2 Oh, we'll find her
label2 You look like hammered shit
label2 Thank you
label2 You ever see that guy in the glasses before
label2 Don't worry
label2 I mean, you tend to get a lot of...  Dogooders
label2 Freaks
label2 Hey, I meant to ask you
label2 Noelle hawthorne
label2 She lives on your street
label2 Amy's best friend
label2 I've never heard the name noelle hawthorne
label2 Oh
label2 Yeah, we might say hi to them on the street
label2 But "best friend"
label2 No
label2 He acted like noelle was a complete stranger
label2 Of course he did
label2 Oh, look
label2 He's being a good guy..
label2 You really don't like him, do you
label2 What's to like
label2 This mailbox is currently full
label2 Press one to...  Nick
label2 I just wanted to introduce myself
label2 I am so sorry for your troubles
label2 Thank you
label2 That's kind
label2 Are you remembering to eat
label2 I'm gonna fix you up my worldfamous chicken frito pie
label2 That's very kind and very unnecessary
label2 You have to keep your strength
label2 Would you...  Say, "chicken frito pie!
label2 You know what
label2 It's a nice photo
label2 I know it is
label2 Will you
label2 Would you go ahead and please delete that picture
label2 You just press...  What is wrong with you
label2 Could you please not share that with anyone
label2 I will share it with whomever I please
label2 Dude
label2 Marybeth is pissed
label2 Why
label2 Marybeth
label2 It's like you're the goddamn homecoming king
label2 It was important to my mother that I be polite..
label2 It looked like you were having fun
label2 I am in a nightmare
label2 All I'm trying to do is be nice...  To the people who are volunteering to help find Amy
label2 You're right
label2 My God, this place literally smells like feces
label2 In your searches, did you find any golf clubs, real fancy
label2 No
label2 How about a brand new stratocaster
label2 Well, all right
label2 How big's that TV
label2 It's not 65inch
label2 Okay
label2 Kibble
label2 Excuse me
label2 He asked me to feed his cat
label2 I saw some in the pantry
label2 Detective boney, officer gilpin
label2 I know y'all are in there
label2 Detective boney
label2 Just remind her it is a possible crime scene
label2 Look at that pieeating grin, from a guy whose wife is missing
label2 How are you doing
label2 Terrific
label2 How's marybeth
label2 And you
label2 Awesome
label2 Hey...  Have you told me everything
label2 Of course
label2 Why would you even ask me that
label2 Ever since you walked into the bar that morning Amy went missing, you seem...   Off
label2 I am off
label2 Everybody's examining me and projecting their shit on me
label2 Can we do that
label2 Of course
label2 You know what I keep thinking
label2 If mom were here
label2 Like I'm 12
label2 Nick, mom would fix it
label2 I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep
label2 Love you
label2 Love you
label2 I am a missourian
label2 Bye, dad
label2 No money, no jobs, no prospects
label2 Mama Maureen..
label2 Stage 4 breast cancer
label2 So, we moved to Missouri
label2 I just wish he'd asked
label2 Nick is happy to be home
label2 But I don't know if he's happy I'm with him
label2 I feel like something he loaded by mistake
label2 Something to be jettisoned, if necessary
label2 I feel like I could disappear
label2 Oh, my God
label2 I saw you on TV
label2 It's so crazy
label2 Yeah, I know
label2 She just vanished
label2 She's just gone
label2 I've been so worried about you
label2 I called you a hundred times
label2 You gotta pick up your phone
label2 Rehearsals
label2 Godspell
label2 My sister's asleep in the other room
label2 I needed to see you
label2 I know this is a bad idea
label2 Can you at least tell me you love me
label2 I've been so scared
label2 Between rehearsals
label2 I know
label2 We need to stop
label2 I need you
label2 Touch me
label2 Stop it
label2 Come here
label2 Okay
label2 Did you, by any chance, tell anybody anything about us
label2 Facebook
label2 I use the disposable phone
label2 You buy my presents in cash
label2 I know, sweetie
label2 Did you leave a pair of red panties in my office
label2 I don't know
label2 Maybe
label2 They better be mine
label2 Sweetheart, think
label2 I'd have to check my red panty inventory
label2 Andie, I need you to take this seriously, okay
label2 Until it's safe
label2 You were going to get a divorce
label2 Never say that out loud again
label2 Okay
label2 I don't wanna fight
label2 I just wanna be with you
label2 Andie, please...  That's all I want
label2 I can't
label2 It's our last time together
label2 Let's make the most of it
label2 My husband has come undone
label2 We moved to Missouri to save Maureen..
label2 It means a lot that you came
label2 We took a hit on the brownstone...  And I used the last of my trust fund to buy him a bar
label2 So far, it's just costing money
label2 Nick uses me for sex when he wants
label2 Otherwise, I don't exist
label2 We should go to outback tonight
label2 That would be nice
label2 I became someone I don't even like
label2 The kind of woman I used to mock
label2 You're out so much
label2 Stay home
label2 I can't, I'm already late
label2 Then, can I come
label2 You would hate it
label2 Do our code
label2 No bullshit
label2 I thought we weren't gonna be that couple
label2 Okay, bye
label2 Hey, I've been thinking
label2 Something positive
label2 Maybe it's time
label2 Now is literally the worst time
label2 It would be a new start for us
label2 And for me, I would have a real purpose here
label2 Not a hobby
label2 An inspiration
label2 We could have had this fight four hours ago
label2 I'm late
label2 You really wanna be the couple that has a baby to save their marriage
label2 "Save"
label2 Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever
label2 Yeah
label2 You're a fucking coward
label2 No, it can't go on like this
label2 Really
label2 I won't
label2 You won't
label2 Why, it's not good enough for you
label2 It's not even close
label2 You stupid bitch
label2 What scared me was how much he wanted to hurt me more
label2 What scared me was that I'd finally realized..
label2 I am frightened of my own husband
label2 Nah, I'll protect you
label2 Jesus
label2 Seems like folks are trying
label2 You really think this is anything
label2 Cross it off the list
label2 Hey, Jason
label2 What's up, Rhonda
label2 "...and dedicated to the proposition that all men..."   Have you seen this girl around here
label2 She was reported missing
label2 "...and so dedicated, can long endure.
label2 Yeah
label2 I remember her
label2 What did she want
label2 She wanted a gun
label2 I told her it's not my thing
label2 I felt bad, though
label2 She seemed really desperate
label2 You don't forget a girl like that in here
label2 She was all in pink
label2 It was Valentine's day
label2 For Valentine's day, I thought I'd buy a gun
label2 That is how crazy I've become
label2 Nick wants me gone but he won't ask for a divorce
label2 The bitch with the prenup
label2 I could go home to my parents..
label2 But I'd have to tell them the truth
label2 And I don't even know if I believe the truth
label2 I'm being paranoid
label2 Crazy
label2 It's just..
label2 I'd sleep better with a gun
label2 Oh, shit
label2 My sister's gonna come out here
label2 Sorry to rush you
label2 It's okay
label2 Here
label2 Let me help you
label2 Just get that
label2 Be very careful
label2 I'm all right
label2 Here you go
label2 Okay, we will
label2 Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy
label2 Don't go crazy
label2 Okay
label2 You fucking asshole
label2 You fucking lied to my fucking face
label2 I'm sorry
label2 How old is she
label2 How long
label2 A year and a half
label2 If I told you, you would have made me stop
label2 It's so fucking small
label2 You're a liar and a cheat
label2 You're just like dad
label2 How did you even meet her
label2 I thought writers hated clichés
label2 I'm not a writer
label2 "Boohoo, I got laid off
label2 It wasn't like that, okay
label2 You have no idea how shitty it was with Amy...  How fucking terrible she made me feel
label2 I would get knots in my stomach...  Just coming home, knowing she would be sitting there..
label2 Dissatisfied, before I even walked in the fucking door
label2 This is so bad
label2 If anybody finds out, you're totally fucked
label2 Boney found a pair of panties in my office...  Where, occasionally, Andie and I..
label2 Are they supertwat's
label2 Her name is Andie
label2 She's not entirely sure
label2 So we are dealing with a 20yearold...  Who isn't sure where she leaves her undies
label2 If they're not Andie's, that means that they're Amy's...  And she left them there for me to find
label2 Nick, I was scared for you before, and now, I'm fucking petrified
label2 We're having a vigil tonight for your missing wife...  And this morning, you're kissing your college girlfriend goodbye
label2 Have you watched television lately
label2 I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep
label2 His wife's nowhere to be found...  And here's Nick dunne for you, flirting
label2 Cute pic, huh
label2 Who is that
label2 Some fucking tragedy groupie
label2 I don't know
label2 She was trying to give me a casserole
label2 On the show today we have defense attorney, Tanner bolt...  Patron Saint to wifekillers everywhere
label2 Tanner bolt, would you actually consider defending Nick dunne
label2 Well, let me just say...  As always, Ellen, thank you for such a warm welcome
label2 But of course, I'd defend Nick dunne
label2 Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath is a lack of empathy
label2 But the truth is, you'd have to be a sociopath...  To behave normally in this situation...  Because it's the most abnormal situation in the world
label2 I'm so sick of being picked apart by women
label2 You need to hire Tanner bolt
label2 I don't deserve this
label2 Innocent until proven guilty
label2 That's exactly what you deserve
label2 Go home, Nick
label2 I can't believe we haven't arrested this guy
label2 We're not gonna arrest anybody...  Just because some blonde dunce says so
label2 Why are you going so easy on him
label2 You got a crush
label2 And, two, don't talk to me that way, ever
label2 We don't know who or what was scaring her, gil
label2 Give me the update
label2 No drug angles panned out yet, so cross that off the list
label2 I talked to the nurses who care for Nick's father
label2 The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten, so cross that off the list
label2 Hey
label2 So, luminol lit up the kitchen like the 4th of July
label2 Whoa
label2 Yeah
label2 The blood is profuse
label2 It is Amy's, type b, and we should have DNA soon
label2 Maybe a club or a twobyfour
label2 She fell there, but I doubt she got back up
label2 Amy's medical records come in
label2 No, we'll have them later tonight
label2 My wife says he's a killer
label2 Hey
label2 Thank you all for coming out
label2 Hey Donnie, how are you
label2 Hey
label2 Thank you, folks
label2 Thank you for being here tonight
label2 It just means the world to our family
label2 And to Amy
label2 Disappeared three days ago
label2 And I want to implore anyone who has any information at all..
label2 Please come forward
label2 Help us
label2 So hot
label2 He is so creepy
label2 I had nothing to do with the disappearance of my wife
label2 I haven't hired a lawyer
label2 I have nothing to hide
label2 Amy is my soul mate
label2 She is brilliant...  She's charming, and wise
label2 Asshole
label2 I love my wife..
label2 So much
label2 And I may not behave for the cameras the way they want me to...  And if they wanna punish me for that, that's okay
label2 But don't harass the people of this town
label2 If you need to mock somebody, mock me
label2 Nick
label2 But please don't turn this investigation into a circus
label2 Where's your wife, Nick
label2 Let the police do their jobs
label2 Did you tell them that, Nick
label2 Did you tell them Amy was six weeks pregnant
label2 Thank you for your support tonight
label2 Let's find Amy
label2 Go ahead, if you guys wanna say something
label2 Nick, where are you going
label2 No questions right now
label2 Thank you
label2 Why are you running away
label2 Don't run
label2 Everybody, stay back
label2 Guys, come on
label2 You know better
label2 Get off the grass, get down to the curb
label2 All right
label2 All right, y'all heard her
label2 No pictures
label2 Hello
label2 Fuck
label2 You scared me
label2 Want a drink
label2 I told you, noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy
label2 They look like pretty good friends to me
label2 Look, I don't know
label2 But it certainly doesn't prove that she's pregnant
label2 We have her medical records coming
label2 Good
label2 So, let's talk while we wait
label2 The scene of the crime
label2 You see, we've seen dozens of home invasions
label2 Dozens and dozens
label2 This area right here, it looked wrong from the second we saw it
label2 The whole thing looked staged
label2 And yet, they remained upright throughout this lifeanddeath struggle
label2 I don't know
label2 What do you want me to say
label2 Did you do any housekeeping the day your wife went missing
label2 No
label2 And I'm sorry to tell you, but that kitchen lit up
label2 Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick
label2 Oh, my God
label2 Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up
label2 Wait a second
label2 If they're trying to stage a crime scene
label2 No blood and no body suggests kidnapping
label2 It tells us, look at people outside the house
label2 A pool of blood and no body suggests homicide
label2 It tells us to look at people inside the house
label2 Which is what we're doing here, Nick
label2 I see
label2 Because right now, all we got is noelle
label2 She says, "not good.
label2 Gil, what do you and your wife argue about
label2 What pisses you off
label2 Money, lack thereof
label2 Me and my ex, it's the same
label2 I mention that because we got a look at your finances, Nick
label2 What
label2 I pulled up some of the merchandise
label2 There are these fun little splurges
label2 I didn't buy any of this stuff
label2 I do
label2 You bought great clubs
label2 I like the robot dog
label2 This is a felony
label2 We need to find out who did this
label2 All right
label2 Let's talk about life insurance
label2 Because in April, you bumped up Amy's life insurance...  To $1.2 million
label2 Yes, I did
label2 You filed the paperwork
label2 Because she told me to
label2 Hold on a sec
label2 Yeah
label2 Okay
label2 For sure
label2 She was pregnant
label2 This is insane
label2 So, my question becomes..
label2 Without a lawyer
label2 Margo
label2 Hey
label2 Just hold on a second
label2 Let me finish
label2 Nick
label2 I was as surprised as..
label2 I know you're upset
label2 I had no idea she was pregnant
label2 Listen, I thought so, too, but evidently that wasn't...  you want to know the truth
label2 Well, I'm as surprised as...  you told me you didn't want kids
label2 I was trying to put a good face on
label2 Then, suddenly, you've got a pregnant wife
label2 Especially when you factor in the secret teenage girlfriend
label2 Oh, stop watching Ellen abbott
label2 You have to fucking talk to me
label2 I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids because she didn't want me to
label2 And we had enough of those already
label2 It was easier to just...   lie to me
label2 I wanted kids
label2 When we first moved here, I went to a fertility clinic
label2 It didn't work
label2 I did my part
label2 When it came time for Amy to do her thing, all of a sudden it was like...  "Well, I don't know
label2 No, thanks.
label2 Now, who would believe you
label2 All right
label2 This is a letter from the clinic...  Notifying me that they're gonna destroy my sample..
label2 Unless I contact them
label2 So, I gave it to Amy
label2 But you were already with Andie by then, right
label2 A year ago, Amy being pregnant would have been the best thing ever
label2 "When your poor Amy has a cold, this dessert just..."  this is the clue you couldn't solve
label2 Yeah
label2 A letter from desi
label2 It was the fucking rich guy who would do anything for her
label2 It just kept hanging over my head
label2 It was disgusting
label2 Your prenup
label2 Nick, why have you kept this stuff
label2 It's like a little box of hate
label2 Maybe I hate her
label2 I love you no matter what
label2 But you need to tell me
label2 Tell you what
label2 What are you asking me
label2 Is that what you're asking me
label2 If I murdered my wife
label2 I would never ask you that
label2 Don't walk on the glass
label2 You have no clue, do you
label2 Why was he here that night
label2 His wife is missing
label2 Why come here
label2 Rhonda, we got this
label2 Let's make the arrest
label2 No
label2 Well, it's incredibly hard
label2 So, I want one last thing
label2 What's that
label2 I want a body
label2 Picture me
label2 I'm a girl who's very, very bad
label2 I need to be punished, and by "punished," I mean "had.
label2 It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five
label2 So, open the door...  Punish
label2 Wood
label2 And look alive
label2 Punish
label2 Wood
label2 Wood
label2 That this child might really save our marriage
label2 But I could be wrong
label2 Because sometimes..
label2 The way he looks at me..
label2 I think...  Man of my dreams...  Father of my child..
label2 He may truly..
label2 Kill me
label2 Wtf
label2 I am so much happier now that I'm dead
label2 Technically, "missing.
label2 Gone
label2 And my lazy, lying, cheating, oblivious husband...  Will go to prison for my murder
label2 Nick dunne took my pride and my dignity...  And my hope and my money
label2 He took and took from me until I no longer existed
label2 That's murder
label2 Let the punishment fit the crime
label2 Harvest the details of her humdrum life
label2 And cram her with stories about your husband's violent temper
label2 Secretly create some money troubles
label2 Credit cards, perhaps online gambling
label2 With the help of the unwitting...  Bump up your life insurance
label2 Purchase getaway car
label2 Craigslist
label2 Generic
label2 Pay cash
label2 You need to package yourself so that people will truly mourn your loss
label2 As if it's so hard to spread your legs
label2 You know what's hard
label2 Faking a pregnancy
label2 First, drain your toilet
label2 Invite pregnant idiot into your home...  And ply her with lemonade
label2 Steal pregnant idiot's urine
label2 A pregnancy is now part of your legal medical record
label2 Happy anniversary
label2 Wait for your clueless husband...  To start his day
label2 And the clock is ticking
label2 Meticulously stage your crime scene...  With just enough mistakes to raise the specter of doubt
label2 You need to bleed
label2 A lot, a lot
label2 A head wound kind of bleed
label2 A crime scene kind of bleed
label2 You need to clean poorly...  Like he would
label2 Clean and bleed
label2 Bleed and clean
label2 And because you're you...  You don't stop there
label2 You need a diary
label2 Minimum, 300 entries on the Nick and Amy story
label2 Start with the fairy tale early days
label2 And they're crucial
label2 You want Nick and Amy to be likeable
label2 After that, you invent
label2 The spending
label2 The abuse
label2 The fear
label2 The threat of violence
label2 And Nick thought he was the writer
label2 Make sure the cops will find it
label2 Finally, honor tradition with a very special treasure hunt
label2 And after all the outrage, when I'm ready..
label2 I'll go out on the water with a handful of pills...  And a pocket full of stones
label2 And when they find my body, they'll know...  Nick dunne dumped his beloved like garbage
label2 And she floated down past all the other..
label2 Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women
label2 Then, Nick will die, too
label2 But, then, we never really existed
label2 "Cool girl.
label2 Men always use that as their defining compliment
label2 "She's a cool girl.
label2 Cool girl is hot
label2 Cool girl is game
label2 Cool girl is fun
label2 She only smiles in a chagrined, loving manner...  And then presents her mouth for fucking
label2 She likes what he likes
label2 So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster who loves fetish manga
label2 If he likes girls gone wild, she's a mall babe...  Who talks football and endures buffalo wings at Hooters
label2 And for him, I'll admit, I was willing to try
label2 I waxstripped my pussy raw
label2 I drank canned beer watching Adam sandier movies
label2 I blew him semiregularly
label2 I lived in the moment
label2 I was fucking game
label2 I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it
label2 Nick teased out of me things I didn't know existed
label2 A lightness, a humor, an ease
label2 Sharper
label2 I inspired him to rise to my level
label2 I forged the man of my dreams
label2 We were happy pretending to be other people
label2 And what's the point of being together if you're not the happiest
label2 But Nick got lazy
label2 He actually expected me to love him unconditionally
label2 Then he dragged me, penniless, to the navel of this great country...  And found himself a newer, younger, bouncier..
label2 You think I'd let him destroy me and end up happier than ever
label2 No fucking way
label2 He doesn't get to win
label2 My cute, charming, saltoftheearth, Missouri guy
label2 He needed to learn
label2 Grownups work for things
label2 Grownups pay
label2 Wait
label2 I need 20 seconds where you don't judge me, interrupt me...  Or get angry
label2 Is that all the stuff from the credit cards
label2 Where do you store goodies for anniversary five
label2 Wood
label2 Woodshed
label2 Yeah, my woodshed
label2 I thought..
label2 It's all right
label2 I would have, too
label2 What's that present
label2 I don't know
label2 Let's find out
label2 "Don't believe that for a second
label2 "I know where you've been, and I know where you're going.
label2 "For this anniversary, I've arranged a trip
label2 "Follow the river, up, up, up
label2 What's "up, up river"
label2 "Up the river.
label2 Fucking crazy bitch
label2 That's what this is
label2 She's framing me for her murder
label2 You married a complete psychopath
label2 The morning of our anniversary..
label2 I was gonna ask her for a divorce
label2 I couldn't fake it for another year, another day
label2 Then what happened
label2 Before I could say anything, she said...  "I need you to go somewhere and really think about our marriage.
label2 She knew I would go to Sawyer beach
label2 She stagemanaged me
label2 And I fucking did it
label2 I went to the beach, I thought about our marriage
label2 I came back and decided I wanted a divorce
label2 You fuck
label2 She's good
label2 Part of me was relieved..
label2 When I thought she was gone
label2 Remember, he beats Judy to death and kills that baby
label2 So I'm punch
label2 We already knew that, Amy, what's your point
label2 Does Missouri have the death penalty
label2 Hey, neighbor
label2 It's been weeks since I had anyone decent next door
label2 Well, I don't know how decent I feel
label2 All right
label2 Nice meeting you
label2 I'm greta
label2 I'm Nancy
label2 Are you going to the marina
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I can't
label2 I've got work to do
label2 All right
label2 You will
label2 Come on
label2 Show me that darling Nicky smile
label2 You asshole
label2 Nancy
label2 Nancy
label2 It's hot again today
label2 So, where are you from
label2 Nebraska
label2 New Orleans
label2 Oh, I just bet you are
label2 Lotions and balms
label2 Ointment
label2 I would hate for y'all to get tan lines
label2 Okay
label2 You know where I'll be
label2 I see we have the same taste in men
label2 I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet
label2 Let me guess
label2 He's trying to watch the big game and you just won't shut up
label2 No, you don't seem like much of a talker
label2 I got it
label2 Worse
label2 Worse
label2 I went to the bar where he works to surprise him
label2 And out he comes with this girl who had no business being in a bar
label2 On the very first night that we met...  We walked by a bakery that was having their sugar delivered
label2 And it was in the air, everywhere
label2 And before he kissed me..
label2 He leaned in...  And did this
label2 And guess what
label2 He did the exact same thing with her
label2 That is the most disgusting thing I ever heard
label2 Thanks very much
label2 Well, we've gone mainstream
label2 It's an appeals process, so we will attempt to appeal to them
label2 Mr. bolt
label2 Tanner bolt
label2 Nick dunne
label2 I have been sitting by the phone, my friend
label2 Do you not believe me
label2 No, I believe you
label2 It's just the craziest thing I've ever heard
label2 I love it
label2 But you gotta have a grudging respect for your wife at this point, right
label2 Are you laughing me out of the building
label2 No
label2 I'm in
label2 I'm way in
label2 You came to the right guy
label2 This is what I do, Nick
label2 This is why I have a $100,000 retainer
label2 $100,000
label2 We'll figure something out
label2 I'll give you a special...  "My wife is skilled in the art of vengeance" rate
label2 Okay
label2 Well, right now, it's a "he said, she said.
label2 No, Nick
label2 She is telling the perfect story
label2 So, we need to start today to prepare your defense, should we need it
label2 And if we decide to go with your version of...  the truth
label2 Then we'll need to realign the public's perception of Amy
label2 Now, that is a huge realignment
label2 We'll need other voices besides yours
label2 There has to be someone out there that she's screwed with in the past
label2 There's a New York guy
label2 Eight years ago, she pressed charges against him
label2 That should be easy to find
label2 Exclassmate, desi collings
label2 She said that he stalked her
label2 He's in St. Louis
label2 You go talk to Tommy, and I'll draw up the contract
label2 Apparently
label2 Tommy
label2 Thanks for seeing me
label2 Yeah, yeah, yeah
label2 You're gonna want a drink
label2 Yeah
label2 No, dude, she said I raped her
label2 First degree, felony rape
label2 Did you do it
label2 Did you do it
label2 Did you get a trial
label2 Fuck, no
label2 I pled down, man
label2 Sexual assault one, no jail time
label2 That's something
label2 Oh, yeah
label2 I'm on a neighborhood watch list, because I have to register as a predator
label2 I haven't had a date in almost a decade, because if a girl googles me...  Could you walk me through what happened
label2 I meet Amy at this party, you know
label2 We click
label2 She's perfect
label2 I think, "what's the catch?
label2 A few months, it hits me
label2 This is not going to be easy
label2 Girls like a fixerupper, but Amy
label2 She made me her business
label2 It was just too much
label2 She went out and bought me ties
label2 Ties
label2 The whole thing just became...   so, you broke up with her
label2 No, I just backed away
label2 Gave her some space
label2 No big deal, right
label2 So I thought
label2 And within two minutes, she's got my pants around my ankles...  And she is kneeling down, and..
label2 I'm sorry
label2 You had sex
label2 Yeah, consensual
label2 It was rough, but she was screaming for it
label2 Next morning, there's two cops at my door
label2 Amy has wounds that are consistent with rape
label2 Ligature marks on her wrist, and my semen
label2 It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed, and raped her
label2 And then, guess what they find
label2 Headboards of my bed, one on each side
label2 The ties you wouldn't wear
label2 Did you ever see her again
label2 Yeah
label2 On TV, last week, with you
label2 I thought, "there's Amy
label2 "She's graduated from being raped to being murdered.
label2 You been watching this, too
label2 We just found out...  Amy elliott dunne was, indeed, pregnant when she went missing
label2 Kelly capitono, this makes me wanna throw up
label2 What is it about a pregnant woman, a woman carrying life inside her...  That turns men into animals
label2 Ellen, this is an epidemic
label2 Let's not forget about the wife, ever
label2 Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend, noelle hawthorne
label2 Thanks for being on the show, noelle
label2 And let me just say this...  Amy would have loved you, and all you do for women
label2 Oh, that's nice
label2 Why don't you tell us about your friend, noelle
label2 Oh, I'd love if just once, someone was like...  "She was a real rag.
label2 She was beautiful and smart and kind
label2 Seems like a rich bitch to me
label2 What do you mean
label2 I don't know
label2 She seems uppity
label2 Spoiled rich girl, married a cheating asshole
label2 Paid the ultimate price
label2 The only secret was her husband
label2 He never introduced himself
label2 Why do you think
label2 I think we know why
label2 Because he had a violent temper
label2 A little harsh
label2 That's life, baby
label2 He knew I'd have seen right through him
label2 Don't get me wrong
label2 I'm just saying, there are consequences
label2 Fuck, yeah
label2 And she was so innocent
label2 You're a good friend, noelle
label2 And you're a good friend of the show
label2 Thanks for coming on
label2 Please tell me you landed Tanner bolt
label2 Tanner bolt landed me
label2 I'm gonna try and see desi collings on my way home
label2 That's just the retainer
label2 Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings
label2 I'm approved for a second mortgage on the house
label2 We will go from there
label2 Thank you
label2 I love you, too
label2 Nick keeps his father, who has Alzheimer's, in a facility
label2 Number of times he visited last year
label2 One
label2 Oh, fuck
label2 His twin sister, margo, well, she is a peach
label2 Playing what, Lauren
label2 Playing house
label2 What the fuck
label2 Twin siblings often enable and abet
label2 While I never examined Nick, or his sister..
label2 Disturbingly close, Lauren
label2 And so, we close with a question
label2 What kind of moral rot..
label2 Allows a beautiful, talented, kind, smart, loving mother...  To vanish without the heavens hearing our outraged cries
label2 Can I bum a cigarette
label2 Amy elliott dunne, we care about you, and we will not forget
label2 And you know what else we won't forget
label2 Missouri has the death penalty
label2 I'd like to report some strange activity...  Near the woodshed on the property of one margo dunne
label2 Hey
label2 Mr. collings
label2 I know you
label2 I saw you at the volunteer center
label2 I wanted to help
label2 I hope you don't mind me coming by
label2 Amy and I believe in the lost art of letterwriting
label2 I always wondered why you kept in touch after...  Everything
label2 You were together for two years in boarding school, right
label2 She was my first serious girlfriend
label2 Why did you break up
label2 Did you cheat on her
label2 That's a rude question
label2 Let me tell you what Amy told me
label2 She dumped you, you completely unraveled
label2 Your wife is missing, and you came all this way to tell me this
label2 I thought there might be another side to this story
label2 Mr. collings
label2 Fuck
label2 The missing persons case of Amy elliott dunne
label2 She is the beautiful blonde inspiration for the amazing Amy kids' book series
label2 You're reading that diary again
label2 It interests me
label2 Hey, Rhonda
label2 "He's gonna kill me.
label2 Why did he go to his dad's house to burn it
label2 It's private
label2 There's no one there
label2 Because he tripped the alarm
label2 You were up his ass with a flashlight
label2 The whole thing just feels hinky
label2 Like finding an envelope marked "clue.
label2 You ever hear the expression...  "The simplest answer is often the correct one"
label2 Actually, I've never found that to be true
label2 Good night
label2 Elvis is in Missouri
label2 Thank God
label2 Come on in
label2 First thing you have to understand about Amy, she loves to teach lessons
label2 Play God
label2 Yeah, old testament God
label2 Okay
label2 Keep talking
label2 Decides to teach me a lesson
label2 Blood in the house, credit cards, life insurance
label2 She does the treasure hunt
label2 Now, the treasure hunt is critical
label2 She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities
label2 And she leaves clue number one for the police..
label2 Which will lead them back to my office..
label2 Which is a place where Andie and I would often...  And she leaves a pair of red panties
label2 Right
label2 Racy, looks bad
label2 Clue two
label2 Another place where Andie and I would occasionally have relations
label2 Clue three
label2 Woodshed
label2 Also a location...  Oh, my God
label2 We had limited options
label2 Put it on Andie's credit card
label2 Andie's statement went right to her parents
label2 Nick, margo, can we head over to the little brown house
label2 This leads us to what
label2 Dad's house is blue
label2 After the divorce, when dad wasn't coming around..
label2 I used to pretend that he was a spy named Mr. brown, who...  For the sake of his children's safety, had to deny their existence
label2 You never told me that
label2 We've got incriminating red panties in your office
label2 We've got a showcase showdown worth of crap in your woodshed
label2 So, what in God's name is at your father's house, Nick
label2 And be honest
label2 I honestly have no idea
label2 We got a lot of uncontained issues here
label2 Nick, do you have any idea as to what Andie's mindset is
label2 We haven't communicated since the vigil
label2 Okay
label2 Amy's parents
label2 No, it's...  More pressure
label2 No, Andie won't do that
label2 She will
label2 Don't take it personally
label2 Amy's got us in an interesting bind
label2 We need to tell the cops about Andie
label2 Really
label2 Right now, Andie just gives you another motive
label2 We need to be on the front end of that
label2 But I'm gonna warn you as to what will happen
label2 They'll go after margo
label2 She's your accomplice
label2 She helped you hide the evidence
label2 In all likelihood, she knows that you killed Amy
label2 God
label2 Well, what are we going to do
label2 No
label2 Any other strategy is missing the point
label2 I've got two exsecret service guys that are really good
label2 I'll put them on it
label2 But where do they start, Nick
label2 Where would Amy go
label2 Are we keeping score
label2 I thought we were steering clear of men for a while
label2 He's nice
label2 Because he wants to fuck you
label2 She's still moping about her ex
label2 He got cheated on, too
label2 I'm not sad
label2 I'm angry
label2 There you go
label2 I almost drank myself to death when my wife left me
label2 Can you believe that
label2 Don't give him the pleasure
label2 I was going to drown myself in the Gulf of Mexico...  Let myself be dinner for the great whites
label2 Gulf is bull sharks, miss nawlins
label2 Why should I die
label2 Please put that on a tshirt
label2 Miss moneybags
label2 I thought you said you were broke
label2 That's a fat wad
label2 It's mostly singles
label2 What are you, a stripper
label2 Swamp girls, or treasure chest
label2 Don't they tease people down in nola
label2 We can expect Nick dunne's arrest any day now
label2 We've got blood in the house, huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy
label2 Crying out for justice
label2 We'll be right back
label2 Tanner has a very bad idea he's going to pitch you
label2 Yeah
label2 It could go so wrong
label2 And you are going to tell her about Andie
label2 Nope
label2 That sounds like a very bad idea
label2 You haven't heard from her in three days
label2 This is a ticking time bomb
label2 People are gonna hate me
label2 And then, they will forgive you
label2 A guy admitting that he's a gigantic asshole on television
label2 People empathize with that
label2 They need to see you
label2 Sharon's specials, they get 10 million viewers
label2 She is a crusader
label2 If she takes you on as a cause...  she's going to ask real questions
label2 What to say, what not to say
label2 A trained monkey
label2 A trained monkey who doesn't get the lethal injection
label2 Nick, this case is about what people think of you
label2 Now, you do this and you will reach millions of those people
label2 Maybe I only need to reach one
label2 Hello
label2 One minute
label2 Hey
label2 Hey
label2 No, I'm just cleaning up
label2 Let us come in and say goodbye
label2 I'll come by before...  let us give you a hand
label2 Yeah, you gotta clear everything out, here
label2 Dorothy is a real stickler
label2 Not even a spare hanger can you leave behind
label2 Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside
label2 You did a real good job
label2 Where is the money, sweetheart
label2 Look under her dress
label2 He talked you into this
label2 The second you leave, I'm calling the cops
label2 Your hair's dyed all hamster
label2 You say your name's Nancy, but you don't even answer to it half the time
label2 You're hiding
label2 I don't know why, and I don't really care
label2 But you ain't gonna call the cops
label2 And I don't think you've ever really been hit before
label2 Sorry, but we really need the money
label2 Next place, be more careful, okay
label2 Excuse me
label2 You can't sleep here
label2 I did not kill my wife
label2 Why don't you try it again
label2 I didn't kill my wife
label2 What are you doing
label2 Every time you look smug...  Or annoyed or tense, I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear
label2 That's supposed to make me less tense
label2 Let's try it again
label2 Yeah, we had some tough years
label2 I lost my job
label2 You both did
label2 We both lost our jobs
label2 Let's talk about your mom, how close you were
label2 Go on
label2 "Built up" implies that an explosion is coming
label2 No
label2 At a certain point, we got on the wrong track
label2 I had a moment of weakness
label2 I disrespected my wife
label2 And I disrespected my marriage
label2 And I'll always regret it
label2 That works
label2 Don't be afraid to play up the dufus husband thing, Nick
label2 "I was an idiot
label2 I'm a fuckup
label2 "Everything I do is wrong.
label2 What men are supposed to do in general
label2 How do you feel
label2 I feel good
label2 Go, can you pass me that box, please
label2 It's Amy's 33rd birthday present to me
label2 You hate that watch
label2 No, go
label2 Just like I love this tie
label2 Just like I love my wife
label2 It's you
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I'm sorry
label2 Good God
label2 Last week..
label2 I threatened to leave, and he said he'd find me and he'd kill me
label2 So, I disappeared
label2 I couldn't even tell my parents
label2 I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid
label2 Well, he is looking for you
label2 He tracked me from my letters to you
label2 You saved them
label2 Knowing you were out there...  Was the only thing that's kept me going these past few years
label2 Let's go to the police
label2 No, I can't turn up now
label2 I'd be a pariah
label2 Everyone would hate me
label2 Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison
label2 He should go to prison for what he's done
label2 It's utterly secluded
label2 Why are you so good to me
label2 Excuse me
label2 I know you, don't I
label2 No
label2 You're one of the nolan girls, right
label2 Excuse us
label2 We should leave
label2 Just a second
label2 That was boney
label2 I'll call her later
label2 Nice to see you
label2 Sharon
label2 Hi
label2 You're gonna be very happy
label2 Sharon
label2 Ms. schieber
label2 Can I get you anything to drink or eat before we get started
label2 No, I had some gummy bears
label2 What the fuck
label2 We have a major shocking development in the amazing Amy disappearance
label2 We go live to that story now
label2 Oh, my God
label2 You little slut
label2 I met Nicholas dunne..
label2 When he was my creative writing teacher at mill valley
label2 Why is she dressed like a babysitter
label2 I am deeply ashamed...  Of having been romantically involved with a married man
label2 The girl with the giant cumonme tits
label2 Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite
label2 I know that is no excuse
label2 No, it is not
label2 I do not, in my heart, believe Nick dunne would have killed for me
label2 My prayers go out to everyone who loves Amy
label2 We have loved Nick dunne like a son
label2 That love ended today
label2 Come on, you're staring at ghosts
label2 He met our trust with lie after lie
label2 We now absolutely believe...  Nick is involved in the disappearance of our daughter
label2 Our amazing Amy
label2 We're gonna have to bow out of this
label2 Nothing has changed
label2 Everything has changed
label2 An hour ago, we were ahead of this
label2 Now
label2 We're on the defense
label2 This is a completely different dynamic
label2 I can handle it
label2 She's going to eat you alive
label2 Just trust me
label2 Okay
label2 Mic him
label2 Thank you
label2 He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist
label2 Yeah, no kidding
label2 Roll tape
label2 Five... four...  Three... two..
label2 Seriously, I can't believe how fucking good you were
label2 Amy brings out the best in me
label2 Keep it together, you two
label2 At least for the next 24 hours
label2 People still hate you
label2 Women want to scratch your eyes out
label2 Andie was really good TV
label2 Therein lies the problem
label2 Ride this out...  And when Sharon airs tomorrow, we'll be looking at a whole new you
label2 No problem
label2 Welcome
label2 I've got music, satellite...  Netflix
label2 He was her teacher
label2 Roku
label2 Internet, obviously
label2 Here is a supposedly grown man...  if there is ever anything you have a taste for and you can't find it...  Just let me know and I will get it for you
label2 Instead of the abc's, he taught her the birds and the bees
label2 Wine cellar's downstairs
label2 I'll get you some clothes, too
label2 Not that I don't appreciate bait shop chic
label2 The floors are heated, just dial to your liking
label2 The shower has steam
label2 The bathtub has a massage cycle
label2 Blackout curtains if you're not
label2 The bed is savoir
label2 You'll never get a better sleep
label2 This is just what I need
label2 I'm so exhausted
label2 I'll leave you to it, then
label2 And I don't want you to worry for one moment
label2 There are cameras everywhere
label2 Anyone...  Who is caught coming or going...  Will be recorded
label2 You are more than safe
label2 And I am not letting you get away again
label2 Good morning
label2 I'm sorry
label2 I need to feel safe
label2 You are very safe
label2 What have you been up to
label2 Nothing
label2 Amy, I'm not Nick
label2 It's hard for me
label2 I know just what that feels like
label2 You were never under my thumb
label2 On your leash
label2 Never
label2 Decent clothes
label2 Hair dye
label2 Makeup
label2 Tweezers
label2 There's a gym overlooking the lake
label2 I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch Sharon schieber, and finally move on
label2 I think that's something I should watch on my own
label2 Nonsense
label2 And I am looking forward...  To my reunion with Amy elliott
label2 Great
label2 Good evening, I'm Sharon schieber
label2 Tonight, exclusively..
label2 Hurry up
label2 But on his infidelity, and all those shocking rumors
label2 Nick dunne...  You're probably the most hated man in America right now
label2 I probably am
label2 I bought that tie
label2 Did you kill your wife, Nick
label2 I did not kill my wife
label2 I am not a murderer
label2 I was unfaithful
label2 And I am deeply ashamed
label2 And, on top of that, you allowed Amy's parents..
label2 Her friends, all the people in your hometown..
label2 Believe you were a loving husband, desperate to find his missing wife
label2 You say that, but I'm wondering how you expect us to believe you...  Now that we know you're a liar
label2 But I don't care about that anymore
label2 I just want to find my wife
label2 I'm just trying to get clear...  Let me be clear
label2 Just because I am not a murderer doesn't make me a good guy
label2 I was a bad husband to a great wife
label2 I broke the vow that I made to her
label2 Those are pretty words, Nick
label2 But what does that really mean to you
label2 It basically means that I was a con artist
label2 I met Amy elliott seven years ago
label2 I was completely transfixed
label2 And I met a woman who dazzled me
label2 And I wanted her to love me..
label2 So I pretended to be better than I was
label2 When we got married, I promised to be that guy
label2 That guy who works harder
label2 That guy who, who lives and acts...  And loves with as much passion as she does
label2 But I failed her
label2 I did what was easy
label2 You talk like a man who believes he can make amends to his wife
label2 Who believes his wife is still alive
label2 She is still alive
label2 Will you look in the lens...  And talk to your wife
label2 If she is out there, able to hear and see you tonight...  What would you like to say to her, Nick
label2 Amy, I love you
label2 And I've taken myself to the woodshed for the way that I've treated you
label2 And if you come back, I promise..
label2 I will spend every day making it up to you
label2 I will be the man that I promised you I would be
label2 I love you
label2 Come home
label2 Regardless of what you thought...  What does it say
label2 I think we can all agree...  Oh, my God
label2 There's more to him than meets the eye
label2 They're going crazy for you
label2 And now they love me
label2 A candor and an honesty that's worthy of respect
label2 He's certainly earned mine
label2 What is it
label2 I'm Sharon schieber
label2 Good night
label2 I usually ignore tipline calls..
label2 But a neighbor was concerned about a strange man around your woodshed
label2 Okay
label2 Fuck
label2 Girlfriend's real cute, Nick
label2 Is that what this is about
label2 I have treated you more than fair throughout this entire investigation
label2 I gave you the benefit of the doubt over and over
label2 Every time you said something stupid..
label2 But I was wrong
label2 That's what this is about
label2 Are these the clubs you don't play golf with
label2 None of that is mine
label2 Those are nice clubs
label2 You got the makings of a real man cave
label2 Everything just waiting until the wife goes away for good
label2 Nick
label2 You can't do that
label2 What can I do to help
label2 I need some time to think
label2 That's the last thing you need
label2 Desi...  twenty years, you have kept me dangling
label2 Finally, last night, you came to me, and you chose me
label2 Don't trust the instinct that left you beaten and homeless...  Sleeping in your car, fearing for your life
label2 I'm not gonna force myself on you
label2 I understand what you're saying, desi
label2 I do
label2 I've been so mistreated for so long
label2 I'll move in here tomorrow...  And we'll work it out together
label2 I just want you to be you again
label2 They only took margo to fuck with you
label2 She's not spending another fucking second in there
label2 What
label2 We tell boney very little
label2 Without a body, without a murder weapon...  Their only hope is a confession
label2 So, you let them do all the talking
label2 That way, we can jumpstart your defense
label2 Recognize these
label2 Yes
label2 Was that how she told you she was pregnant, Nick
label2 Mommy, daddy, baby, and that made you real mad
label2 No
label2 Recognize this
label2 Never seen that before in my life
label2 We found this at your father's house
label2 Is this your wife's handwriting
label2 Our experts thought so, too
label2 Do you wanna play a little true or false
label2 Sure
label2 "And then he brushes the sugar off my lips so he can taste me.
label2 Yeah, that's true
label2 You thought quinoa was a fish
label2 She wanted to get pregnant, you assaulted her
label2 I hit her
label2 No, never happened
label2 Absolutely not
label2 I never touched her
label2 She tried to buy a gun
label2 I doubt that, but I don't know
label2 Shall I read the last entry
label2 "This man may kill me.
label2 In her own words, "this man may kill me.
label2 It's kind of a convenient end note
label2 For future reference..
label2 The truth, you are not a handwriting expert
label2 Okay, I know
label2 Big as a twobyfour, right
label2 Big as a club
label2 We didn't know what the hell it was, but fire in July
label2 We bagged it
label2 I've never seen that before either
label2 We just tested it
label2 Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick
label2 So, finally, Nicholas dunne...  You're under arrest for the murder of your wife
label2 What about my side
label2 Nick
label2 I'd love it
label2 Remember that time we skipped school and drove to the cape
label2 Lobster right from the ocean
label2 This reminds me of that
label2 Neverending holiday
label2 You're not bored
label2 You can discuss 18thcentury symphonies...  19thcentury impressionists, quote proust in French
label2 Nick's idea of culture was a reality TV marathon...  With one hand down his boxers
label2 I really have to get going
label2 But I will be back just as soon as I can
label2 My keys
label2 Thank you
label2 Dunne
label2 You got one hell of a lawyer
label2 Hey
label2 Are you okay
label2 Yes
label2 Are you
label2 Let's go
label2 What does this mean
label2 You can relax at home while we prep for trial
label2 Keep your head down
label2 Tanner, is there any fucking lead on Amy
label2 She's air
label2 Come home, Amy
label2 I dare you
label2 Mr. collings is home
label2 I've missed you
label2 I've been thinking..
label2 I don't wanna be without you
label2 And when all this dies down, we'll go to Greece, like you said

label2 Thank you very much
label2 What do you think
label2 Are we pals again
label2 What do you think
label2 The story's insane
label2 She's on fairly heavy painkillers
label2 It's okay
label2 I want to help
label2 Ms. dunne, I know what you've been through..
label2 So we'll keep this very brief
label2 That morning, the doorbell rang
label2 So normal
label2 I opened the door
label2 Since high school, he won't ever go away
label2 And I've just tried to be nice to him
label2 Answer his letters
label2 Keep him calm
label2 Oh, my God
label2 You can't blame yourself
label2 He pushed inside
label2 But I got away, and ran to the kitchen
label2 And he clubbed me
label2 I collapsed
label2 That club was actually the handle to a punch and Judy puppet
label2 Right
label2 Treasure hunt
label2 I'd hidden some puppets at go's...  then how did desi have that handle
label2 It must have fallen off
label2 I was holding it when desi pushed in
label2 So, he got it from me
label2 About that woodshed..
label2 Tied me to his bed
label2 Back to the woodshed real quick
label2 Real quick
label2 Corresponding to purchases made on credit cards in your husband's name
label2 Nick and credit cards
label2 He buys, I nag
label2 I don't know, probably
label2 They're very close
label2 Now, may I go back to where I was being held prisoner...  By a man with a history of mental problems
label2 Please continue, Ms. dunne
label2 Desi assaulted me that night
label2 Every night
label2 And then, he'd punish me
label2 Starve me
label2 Shave me
label2 Sodomize me
label2 There were cameras everywhere
label2 Please find the tapes
label2 She slit his throat with a box cutter
label2 How did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter..
label2 Can't you just be happy your wife is home and safe
label2 Amy, we found your diary
label2 It contains many concerning allegations of mental and physical abuse
label2 Well, it's the ugly truth
label2 He has a temper
