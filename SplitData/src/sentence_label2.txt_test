Fire in cryogenic compartment
's come down
Talk to me
Wait
Three
It's gonna be 40 below in five minutes
Right
Give us strength, O Lord, to endure
Thank you, gentlemen
We've all taken the vow!  
What brother means to say is we view the presence of any outsider,  especially a woman, as a violation of the harmony,  a potential break in the spiritual unity
What's her medical status
Look
Correct
What's that
I'm the chief medical officer here
I really ought to shave your head
You crashlanded in an E.E.V
Yeah, I'll be sick for a couple of weeks
They didn't make it
Neither have I, for that matter
Why
Natural methane
Disconnected
The corporal was impaled by that safety support
She drowned in her cryotube
Yes
No
We have to do an autopsy
I'm not so sure
Possible contagion
Cholera
Careful
Now, since I'm not a complete idiot,  would you like to tell me what we're really looking for
What's going on, Mr. Clemens
Well, first  the lieutenant is feeling much better, I'm happy to say
Good
We have to cremate the bodies
The lieutenant feels that there is still a possibility of a communicable infection
All doubleychromos
I don't want ripples in the water
Exactly
What do you mean
There's only seven of the friggin' things left, and then we're done with them
If you got the chance
No problem
How's it goin'
She'd soon get the picture
Can't go wrong
The charts say 1 1
Right
"We commit this child...  "and this man to your keeping, O Lord
Why the sacrifice
Nothing's certain
A new beginning
What the fuck are we supposed to do  I, for one  I mean it
There's a lot of talk going around that we've got some disharmony here
I'll tell ya
[ Snickering ]  I ain't going out with him anymore
You got anything to say for yourself
I don't want to hear another word about Golic
As I thought
Well, I guess I must make you nervous
Enough even for you
And until now, no temptation
We're waiting for God to return...  and raise his servants to redemption
What kind of religion
Point is, when the company wanted to close the facility down,  Dillon and the rest of the converts wanted to stay
Now that I've gone out on a limb for you with Andrews,  damaged my already lessthanperfect relationship with that good man,  and briefed you...  on the humdrum history of Fury 1 61,  can you not tell me what you were looking for in the girl
Very direct
Spikey
I think you owe me an answer
I had a terrible dream in hypersleep
Physical contact
When was this
Sorry
Something serious
Official duties
That's his boot
No apologies, Mr. Aaron
I take it he was pulled into the fan
Except the fan was blowing
Will you tell me about your accident
Poor soul backed into a ninefoot fan
A burn
I want to help, but I need to know what's going on...  or what you think is going on
This'll top you up
It's not properly wrapped
Golic
I loved him
Thank you, Mr. Aaron
I'm sorry
I may point out this is the first highlevel communication...  this installation has ever received, to my knowledge
I'm a doctor
Sit down
For her personal edification, of course
Possibly dangerous
About what
And I have my suspicions not all of your concerns with her are medical
She told me she was part of a combat unit that came to grief
You're sure
Get in there
No
No
I gotta reeducate some of the brothers
This makes 1 76
Now, we've encircled this entire compartment once  Hey
It's all right to say "shit.
Somebody will just have to go back and relight them
Okay, who are the comedians
Help me
Go, go, go
Oh, fuck
My legs hurt
No problem
Why were our cryotubes ejected
Lt was in the subflooring
Does the recorder indicate anything
Was there an alien on board
I hurt
You're sure
It wasIt was the dragon
They got sslaughtered like pigs
You called it, sir
Not until we know about the brothers
gonna get anything out of him
He's crazy, he's a fool, but he's not a liar
I'd like to talk to him about thisthis dragon
Isn't that right, Mr. Dillon
lt's important
It's a beauty
Tell me, Lieutenant, what would you suggest we do
Fear
We have some carving knives in the abattoir
That's all
Yes, that's a good girl
Superintendent Andrews wants a meeting
Mmhmm
Nobody's ever been in a hurry to get here before
No
Pissed off
Nobody's persect, only human
Pretty girl
What
Married
tattooed on the back of your head,  you ducked me again
So, I went out and I got more than a little drunk
Boiler had blown on a fuel plant,  and there were 30 casualties
Did you serve your time here
So, do you still trust me with a needle
Amen
Yes
All right
He seems to have been sucked into a ventilator fan
Volunteers will be appreciated
Stop it
Let us be ready
And fast
What the fuck do we do now
Jesus, give us a break
Aaron, we don't want to hear that shit now
Forget fucking Shirley Temple
You run things here anyway
So how are we gonna stop it
Moves differently
The installation's 1 0 miles square
We got a lot of technology, no way to fix it
What 85 is trying to tell you is  Don't call me that
Right
Um,  that leads from the mess hall to the infirmary
Hey, look, there's miles and miles of tunnel through there
Right around...  here
Once you get out of this main shaft, there's no overheads
Most humans have enjoyed that privilege since the Stone Age
No need to be sarcastic
This the only way in or out
This is where we keep it
You can get these drums organized
What's this "85" thing
I saw a drum of this stuff...  fall into a beachhead bunker once
Why should we put our ass on the line for you
The only question is...  what are you gonna do about it
Man, this stuff stinks
I mean, don't breathe too hard
What makes you say that
Yeah
I hate this place
Don't light the fire until I give the signal

Sponsoring a raffle to benefit west county 4h...  And raffling season tickets for mizzou football
I'm the twin
Marybeth, I am really sorry
Should I just go first, and then you guys can say something
Under suspicious circumstances
Please come forward

Mr. elliott, when was the last time you spoke to your daughter
Right, Nick
Do you know about desi collings
Twenty years ago
This is only eight years ago, in New York
What was the charge
Hey, Nick
Yeah
Okay
Afterschool meeting, don't mind if I do
"Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover
"We'll play hot, doting husband, sweet, loving spouse.
I blush
Under my father's name, William dunne
Can you just turn the bell...  yeah, I know
We're good
What you doing
I thought maybe this was the little brown house
"So open the door, and look alive.
Want to test your marriage for weak spots
Those wives who treat their men like dancing monkeys...  To be trained and paraded
Everything else is background noise
My parents' publisher dropped them, and they're in debt up to their ears
That's almost all of it
You know what
More games
What's the laptop for
You are spending a lot
I don't get why you're daring me to be someone I don't wanna be
I'm not that person
I flipped burgers, I painted houses
Slow down, what is it
I knew everything was about to get worse
Mayor
Nick
We videotape everybody that comes in and out of these things
She and her husband have triplets
Excuse me, one sec
Look, these two are yours
So everybody can see him being a good guy
My name's shawna Kelly
Well, a lot of cold cuts
Would you delete that picture for me
But just do me a favor
Yeah
I be considerate, I be a gentleman
And I'm sorry
No, nothing like that
No, it's nowhere near that
Noelle hawthorne
Would you please escort miss hawthorne and her children back out to the street
She's a wreck
Everything
All I want is to come over here, have a beer with you...  And not be judged
Yeah
So, here's a strange, new sentence
And then, we heard from go
I don't mind
Something disposable
Okay
Where have you been
What
I do love you, but we have to be really careful right now
You told me I needed to have my own life
Sit down
Even in texting, or on Facebook
I'm not stupid, Nick
I don't know
This is the last time we're gonna see each other, until...  Until when
I'm sorry
Real quick, but then you have to go
But as it turns out, we couldn't
Last night, I went from desperate to pathetic
I know
It's a bunch of my dorky high school friends
Yeah
A child is not a hobby
I didn't know it was gonna be a fight
And you're gonna walk out the door now
You won't
What scared me wasn't that he'd pushed me
You want me to call for backup
They ought to burn this place down
Why do you ask
Weed, pills
She said it needed to be small, so she could keep it close
Are you sure this is her
In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar, his only line of credit
Can I really think Nick would hurt me
Wake up, baby
Okay
Promise me we'll talk every day
You fucking idiot
She's in her early 20s
You lied to me for over a year
She's one of my students
I guess I'll fuck a teenager.
Flyover boy
I don't know what the fuck it means
Can you imagine
Cable news is all over your shit
Who the fuck is that
Listen, just because this guy isn't walking around weeping...  That doesn't mean that he's not hurting
Tanner, are you trying to tell me that this photo...  Is remotely in the realm of acceptable behavior
Hey, buddy
One, I am conducting an investigation, not a witchhunt
She was trying to buy a gun
Hey
Thoughts on a weapon
Trajectory indicates blunt force
Well, if Tiffany says...  Hey
Rich, thank you so much
As you all know...  My wife, Amy elliott dunne..
I wanna say something, because I think some of you might be wondering...  And are too polite to ask
I'm cooperating with the police
I love you, Amy
But I just wanna ask you in the media, please, harass me..
What did you do to your pregnant wife
Gil, go, go
Stop him
Hey, gil...  On it
Hello
Did you know she was pregnant
She doesn't even know Amy
Let's start over here
Watch this
Because our guys did a luminol test
A lot
Why would they mop up the blood..
Like these homeless you keep mentioning
So, how was your marriage, Nick
$117,000 in credit card debt
I don't even golf
This is identity theft
That was her idea
She wanted me to
All right
I don't want to talk to you again, ever..
I hear you, I hear you
The truth is, Amy didn't want kids
That's a problem for you
Because it would have just been another reason for you to hate her
Masturbate
Maybe
The next day, I saw it in the trash
I wanted a baby with Amy
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's
I don't know, go
Are you asking me if I killed my wife, go
Margo
Who cares
Do you know how hard it is to make a murder case without a body
Be careful
Fuck
Beach
I will practice believing my husband loves me...  And will love this baby
This man of mine may kill me
Soon to be presumed dead
To fake a convincing murder, you have to have discipline
You befriend a local idiot
Cheap
And America loves pregnant women
Voilà
Off he goes
A lot
And leave a little something behind
A fire in July
Those are true
Burn it just the right amount
And if I get everything right, the world will hate Nick...  For killing his beautiful, pregnant wife
Nick and Amy will be gone
Nick loved a girl I was pretending to be
Cool girl never gets angry at her man
When I met Nick dunne, I knew he wanted cool girl
I ate cold pizza and remained a size two
But I made him smarter
We were the happiest couple we knew
He became someone I did not agree to marry
Cool girl
Grownups suffer consequences
Okay
That fucking bitch
"Dear husband, I know you think you're moving through this world unseen
"Sit back and relax, because you are done.
Prison
I just couldn't do it
So you'd have no alibi
She knew exactly what I would do
And by the time you got home...  she was gone
Punch and Judy puppets
As long as you don't own a python and blast death metal at 4 am...  We're gonna be best friends
I could use some creamer
See you around
Hey
Let me guess
You know, I am an expert oiler
So sweet
Least you could do is not keep his secrets for him
You caught your boy rubbing up on some hot little skank...  And he apologized to you by busting you a good one
A sugar storm
What
Thank you
I'm sorry
But, for you, it sucks
Are you kidding me
I win the unwinnable cases
So, what's the plan
She's telling a better story
Make them stop seeing her as America's sweetheart...  And see her for what she is, which a mindfucker of the first degree
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara
I told you, you came to the right guy
Yeah
So, she said you got physical with her
I was looking at 30 years to life
Do I look like I would do well in the yard
I've been unemployed for the last eight years...  Because I have to write "sexual offender" on every job application
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's wellread...  She's got an ass like a 20yearold stripper
She annexed me
And we must have gone 20 rounds over that
Then one night, Amy comes over to my place...  With a bottle of bourbon and a bootleg of this band I love
I know it's your wife
Me
You do know your wife
Last night's bombshell
The third leading cause of death among pregnant women...  Is homicide committed by a boyfriend or husband
Thank you, Ellen
Amy was so nurturing
People love her
We never met Nick
Why was that, noelle
I'm not saying it's okay he killed her
She was so alone
And, go...  Tanner's retainer is $100,000
I've got $2,500 in an ira
I love you
These two spend their days in the bar Amy bought them
They both seem very, very close
It's twincest
Amen
Mr. dunne
I got your address from this letter that you wrote my wife
That's a strange question
Did you treat her bad
You stalked her, you threatened her...  And you attempted suicide in her bed and were institutionalized
You know how it ends
The end
Why didn't he make sure it actually burned
Good night
Hey
She finds out I've been cheating on her with Andie..
Fakes her own death, frames me for it
Rubbing my nose in it
My father's house
A hotel
Amy would have seen the credit card bill
My dad's house
You told her that
Whatever they found, I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad
We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will no doubt go public at any moment
They always do
We need to tell the cops about the woodshed
They can't do that, can they
We find Amy
I have no idea
Hey
We three are the saddest sacks in all the ozarks
I was gonna kill myself
I'm not the asshole
Singles
We're just teasing
And we have Amy elliott dunne, missing for five days..
You're doing Sharon schieber tomorrow in St. Louis
You've gotta throw yourself on it
Why don't we just put out a statement
I will drill you as if you were doing a deposition
They need to like you
Hey, baby
You clearing out
A sock...  Or undies or what have you
I talked him into it
Your glasses are fake
Holy shit
There are a lot of people out there a lot worse than we are
A little less wooden
Mr. dunne, from what I understand, you and your wife had some bumps
I had to move back home so we could take care of my mother...  Who was dying of cancer and my dad, who had...  your dad's scorched earth
For a while, things had been building up
Your "moment" was over 15 months
I know
Thank you
I love that watch
It's you
I lost the baby
He showed up on my doorstep three days ago
You can explain everything
I'm setting you up at my lake house
You know why
No, we're from winnipeg
Tanner
Hope this is worth my while
Thank you so much for doing this
I'm sorry
My name is Andie Fitzgerald
I truly believed we were in love
I apologize for the pain this has caused them
This just got very exciting
We need a moment
I can handle this
Great
One, two, three, four, five
Don't
She's a good person
But, until then...  Don't show your face
Make yourself at home
And just think how her mother must feel at a time like this
There's robes and towels
There's a great view, if you're in the mood
Amy, I am so happy that you are here
The exterior, all along the grounds, the entryway
Don't do that
After so many years under someone's thumb..
A new start
The sooner you look like yourself, the sooner you'll feel like yourself
I'll be back
A husband breaks his silence, not just on his wife's disappearance..
And I probably deserve it
But you were unfaithful
Well, I am desperate to find my missing wife
I didn't come forward with my affair...  Because I knew it would make me look really, really bad
I'm not a good guy
Amy can do that to you
I was this average guy from an average place...  With mediocre aspirations
Instead of doing what was right..
Will you look at that camera for me
You're the best person I've ever known
Here
You fucking killed it
They disliked me, they liked me, they hated me
Margo dunne, this is a search warrant for your property
Call Tanner
I thought, "maybe he's just stupid.
None of this was put here by me
Of course we can
Amy, it's time to move on
Follow that instinct
I've forgotten how to behave
I'm gonna go in, and I'm gonna tell them everything
The truth is my defense
It's Amy's anniversary present to me
It's Amy's diary
He's not a handwriting ex...  Looks like it
That is also true, yes
"Pushed," it says "pushed.
Sure
Judy's missing handle
We found this day one, in the fireplace in your home office
Do not say another word
More coffee
God, yeah
Desi, how could I be bored
That's how the kids wear it
Yeah
Well, you're out on bond
I've got two of my best guys on it
Hello, Mr. collings
Stay with me
Go slowly
Just do it
We'll make sure it's a match
Now that I know you didn't murder your wife, yes
Kidnapping
Can you walk us through what happened
So strange
I've encouraged him
And he grabbed me
I'd just found it
He took me to his lake house
When you went to place the puppets there...  Did you notice that it was packed...  lots of stuff
He hid a lot of stuff at go's
He tied me up like a dog
Please find this
If he had her tied up the whole time
Nick didn't want a baby
