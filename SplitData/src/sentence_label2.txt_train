Fire in cryogenic compartment
All personnel report to...  emergency escape vehicle
Launch of the escape lifeboat will commence...  in Tminus 20 seconds
's come down
Get down to the beach
There may be others
Now
Talk to me
Come on
Come on
Let's go
Get goin', Frank
Get in there
Oh
Jesus Christ
Hell of a way to make a landing
How many
Don't know
Three
Hey, Frank
It's gonna be 40 below in five minutes
All right, all right
Let's get it going
Keep it together
Come on
Right
Here we go, Mr. Dillon
Give us strength, O Lord, to endure
We recognize that we are poor sinners in the hands of an angry God
Amen
[ All ] Amen
Thank you, gentlemen
Here are the facts
As some of you know,  a 337 model E.E.V....  crashlanded here at 0600...  on the morning watch
There was one survivor,  two dead and a droid that was hopelessly smashed beyond repair
I just want to say that I've taken a vow of celibacy
That also includes women
Yes
We've all taken the vow!  
I'd like to say that I, for one,  do not appreciate company policy allowing her to freely...  intermingle with inmates and the rest of the staff
What brother means to say is we view the presence of any outsider,  especially a woman, as a violation of the harmony,  a potential break in the spiritual unity
We are well aware of your feelings in this matter
Hopefully, they will be here inside of a week  Oh, come on
What's her medical status
She doesn't seem too badly damaged
She's unconscious
Can't give you a more specific diagnosis at the moment
Will she live
Look
It's in everybody's interest...  the woman doesn't come out of the infirmary until the rescue team arrives
And certainly not without an escort, right
Sir
Gentlemen, we should all stick to our set routine...  and not get unduly agitated
Right
All right
Thank you, gentlemen
All right
What's that
It's just a little cocktail of my own mix
You a doctor
My name is Clemens
I'm the chief medical officer here
Here
Fury 161
Do you mind
This is basically a stabilizer
I really ought to shave your head
We have a big problem with lice here
And when you're feeling better, I'll give you some clippers,  and you can tend to your private parts yourself
How'd I get here
Evidently separated from your mother ship before you hit our atmosphere
You have any idea how long you were in hypersleep
'Cause coming out the way you did can be quite a jolt to the system
Yeah, I'll be sick for a couple of weeks
Indeed
What
They didn't survive
I have to get to the ship
Have to get to the ship
You're in no condition for that
You want to get me some clothes, or should I just go like this
Given the nature of our indigenous population, I would suggest clothes
[ Clears Throat ]  None of them have seen a woman in years
Why
Keep the pilot light on
The pilot light for what
Blast furnace
Natural methane
We have a foundry, Lieutenant Ripley
How do you know my name
It's stenciled on the back of your shorts
Where are the bodies
We have a morgue
We put them there until the investigative team arrives in about a week, I think
Disconnected
We put what was left on the rubbish tip
The corporal was impaled by that safety support
He never knew what hit him
And the girl
She drowned in her cryotube
I don't think she was conscious when it happened
Where is she
In the morgue
I have to see her
I have to see what's left of her
Is there any particular reason that you're so insistent
Yes
I hate to be repetitious about such a sensitive subject,  but it is persectly clear that she drowned
No
She wasn't
Um  CCould I have a moment alone, please
Yes, of course
What's she doing
Okay
We have to do an autopsy
What
And I told you, she drowned
I'm not so sure
II have to see inside of her
You're disorientated
Half your system's still in  I have a very, very good reason
Possible contagion
What kind exactly
Cholera
Cholera
There hasn't been a case of cholera reported for 200 years
Everything's in place
No indication of disease
Chest
Open the chest
Careful
Flooded with fluid
Ergo, she drowned
Now, since I'm not a complete idiot,  would you like to tell me what we're really looking for
Mr. Clemens
Superintendent
What's going on, Mr. Clemens
That's right, sir
What's going on, Mr. Clemens
Second, in the interest of public health,  I am performing an autopsy
Without my authority
Well, there didn't seem to be time
But it's turned out all right
There's no sign of contagion in the body
But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley didn't parade around in front of the prisoners,  as I am told she did in the last hour
It might also be helpful...  if you kept me informed as to any change in her physical status
Or would that be asking too much
Nonsense
We'll keep the bodies on ice till the rescue team arrives
On ice
There is the public health issue
The lieutenant feels that there is still a possibility of a communicable infection
It would appear that the child drowned
But without the benefit of proper laboratory tests,  it's impossible to be absolutely certain
I would consider it unwise...  to tolerate even the possibility of an unwelcome virus
Would it not, sir
We've 25 prisoners in this facility
All doubleychromos
All thieves, rapists, murderers, child molesters
All scum
Just because they've taken on religion doesn't make them any less dangerous
I don't want to upset the order
I don't want ripples in the water
And I don't want a woman walking around giving them ideas
I see
Exactly
I will leave the details of the cremation to you, Mr. Clemens
They may use the furnace, but I want everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours
You called it, sir
What do you mean
Any dead ox is a good ox
You're bloody right
There's only seven of the friggin' things left, and then we're done with them
God, I hates hosin' these bastards down
I always get shite all over me boots
Talkin' of hosing things down, FrankYeah
You had the chance, what would you say to her
You know
If you got the chance
You mean, casual like
Yeah
I mean, how would you put it to her if you bumped into her in the mess hall or somewhere
No problem
I'd say to her, "Good day, my dear
How's it goin'
Then I'd give her the look, you knowup and down
[ Grunts ]  And I'd give her the wink, the dirty smile
She'd soon get the picture
Yeah, right
And then she'd say, "Kiss my ass, you horny old fucker!
I'd be happy to kiss her anywhere she wants
Yeah, but treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen
Right, Frank
Told you before, Murph
Treat a queen like a whore and a whore like a queen
What do you think killed Babe
Beats me
She just keeled over
The charts say 1 1
In her prime
Never mind
We'll chop her up later and throw her in the stew
Hey, Frank
What's this
"We commit this child...  "and this man to your keeping, O Lord
"They have been released...  from all darkness and pain.
"The child and the man...  "have gone beyond our world
"They are forever eternal...  "and everlasting
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Why are the innocent punished
Why the sacrifice
Nothing's certain
Only that some get called, some get saved
She won't ever know the hardship and grief...  for those of us left behind
We commit these bodies to the void...  with a glad heart
For within each seed,  there is a promise of a flower
[ Gurgling ]  And within each death,  no matter how small,  there's always a new life
A new beginning
Amen
The only one to survive that crash is a woman
What trouble can she cause
What the fuck are we supposed to do  I, for one  I mean it
Okay
There's a lot of talk going around that we've got some disharmony here
Any you guys want to tell me what the problem is
Speak to me, brothers
All right
I don't mind the dark
I don't mind the bugs
I don't mind wanderin' around in some cold, wet, damp tunnel for a week at a time
I don't mind anything
But I mind Golic
That the way you feel about it
The guy's crazy and he smells bad
[ Snickering ]  I ain't going out with him anymore
You got anything to say for yourself
Golic is just another poor, miserable, suffering son of a bitch, just like you and me
'Cept he smells worse
And he's crazy
Knock off the shit
You got a job to do
I don't want to hear another word about Golic
Okay
As I thought
I just wanted to, uh, say thanks for what you said at the funeral
It was, uh  My friends would have appreciated it
Yeah, well, you don't wanna know me, lady
I'm a murderer and rapist of women
Really
Well, I guess I must make you nervous
Do you have any faith, sister
Well, we've got a lot of faith here
I thought women weren't allowed
Well, we've never had any before,  but we tolerate anybody
Even the intolerable
Thank you
Nothing personal
You see, we've got a good place to wait here
And until now, no temptation
What are you waiting for
Huh
We're waiting for God to return...  and raise his servants to redemption
of the alternative people...  embraced religion, as it were, about five years ago
[ Ripley ] I'm on medication
Hardly
Some sort of apocalyptic, millenarian, Christian fundamentalist, uh  Right
Exactly
Point is, when the company wanted to close the facility down,  Dillon and the rest of the converts wanted to stay
And they were allowed to remain as custodians...  with two minders...  and a medical officer
And here we are
How did you get this wonderful assignment
It's okay
Now that I've gone out on a limb for you with Andrews,  damaged my already lessthanperfect relationship with that good man,  and briefed you...  on the humdrum history of Fury 1 61,  can you not tell me what you were looking for in the girl
Ln what way
Ln that way
Very direct
So have I.  â™ª In the year 751 0 â™ª  â™ª If God's acomin' â™ª  â™ª He oughta make it by then â™ª  â™ª Maybe he'll look around and say â™ª  â™ª Guess it's time for the Judgmentâ™ª  Yech
â™ª In the year â™ª â™ª  Hey, Spike
Spike
Are you down there
What are you doing
I really appreciate your affections,  but I am aware that they... deflected my question
In the nicest possible way, of course
You're spoiling the mood
I have a job to do
And now that I'm in your cot,  you think I owe you an answer
I think you owe me an answer
Being in my bed's got nothing to do with it
I had a terrible dream in hypersleep
And I had to be sure what killed her
Anyway, I made a mistake
made another mistake
What's that
Fraternizing with a prisoner
Physical contact
It's against the rules, isn't it
Definitely
When was this
L think you know
You have a bar code on the back of your head
That does deserve an explanation
But I don't think now is the moment
Sorry
On Intercom ] Mr. Clemens
Mr. Aaron
Superintendent Andrews would like you to report...  to vent shaft 22 on the second quadrantnow
Something serious
You could call it that
Sorry
I have to go
Official duties
Murphy
How do you know
That's his boot
I gave him the assignment, sir
No apologies, Mr. Aaron
It wasn't your fault
Well, not much to say, is there
Death was instantaneous
No shit
Sudden rush of air, I'd imagine, except  Right
Almost happened to me once
I've told him so many times, "Stay away from the fans.
Nobody bloody listens
What's that
I don't know
I want to see you in my quarters in 30 minutes, if you'll please, Mr. Clemens
Have you got any ideas
Here you are
You know, wandering around without an escort...  is really gonna piss Superintendent Andrews off
Will you tell me about your accident
Really
How
Hmm
In the air shaft
I found something at the accident site,  just a bit away from where it happened
A mark
A burn
Rather like the one you found on the girl's cryotube
I'm on your side
I want to help, but I need to know what's going on...  or what you think is going on
Lf you really wanna help,  find me a computer with audio capabilities...  so I can access this flight recorder
We don't have anything like that here
The droid that crashed with me
I can point you in the right direction
I can't join you
This'll top you up
Golic, don't fidget
What's all this shit
What the hell does he ever do right
Eat
He's got that down pretty good
You light a candle for Murphy
I'll light a thousand
Never complained about me once
Is it true what they say
His head split into a million pieces
Sit down, Mr. Clemens
Thank you
Sugar
Milk
Just a little, please
Thank you, Mr. Aaron
Listen to me, you piece of shit
You screw with me one more time, I'll cut you in half
I'm sorry
I don't think I understand
They want this woman looked after
They consider her to be very high priority
Why
L have no idea
This accident with Murphy is what happens...  when one of these dumb sons of a bitches walks around with a hardon
I'm a doctor
You're the jailer
We both know exactly what you are
Sit down
I think it might be better if I left
You do
Isn't that lovely
Consider this, Mr. Clemens
How would you like me to explain your sordid history...  to your newfound friend
For her personal edification, of course
I don't like you
Insolent
Possibly dangerous
You question everything
If I didn't need a medical officer,  I wouldn't let you within light years of this operation
I'm eternally grateful
Keep your sarcasms to yourself
About what
About the woman
Don't play with me, Mr. Clemens
You spend every second you can with her
And I have my suspicions not all of your concerns with her are medical
What the hell she was doing in an E.E.V.
She told me she was part of a combat unit that came to grief
Beyond that, I assume it's all classified
I haven't pressed her for more
That's all
You're sure
Yes
No
Get out of here
[ Screams ]  Shut up, you fuckin' bitch
Get in there
Nobody's gonna hear you
Goddamn it, let go of me
Fuck you
No
Hold still
Shh
No
Goddamn it
You okay
No
Take off
I gotta reeducate some of the brothers
We've gotta discuss some matters of the spirit
So let's do it
This is like 1 0 city blocks
How many
Can't you chew a little quieter
I'm trying to figure out how big this compartment is
I can't think with all this goddamn noise you're making
You're not supposed to swear
Now, we've encircled this entire compartment once  Hey
What
What the shit is doing that
Swearing
Shut up
It's all right to say "shit.
What the hell is going on with the candles
Backwash from the closest circulating unit
But if all the candles go out, how the hell we gonna know where we are
Somebody will just have to go back and relight them
I guess I'm nominated
Watch your step, brother
Okay, who are the comedians
Quick, grab it
Help me
Help me
Go
Fuckin' go
Quick
Run
Gimme that
Get this fucking thing off me
Oh, fuck
Let me go
Ah, Ripley
How you feeling
My legs hurt
Uh, listen, I'm sorry
It's okay
How are you
I like your new haircut
No problem
Golic
I'm home
Why were our cryotubes ejected
Stasis interrupted
Fire in cryogenic compartment
Repeat
What started the fire, Bishop
Can you hear me
The fire was electrical
Lt was in the subflooring
Did the sensors pick up anything moving around on the ship prior to separation
It's very dark here, Ripley
I'm not what I used to be
Just tell me
Was there an alien on board
Yes
Is it on the Sulaco or did it come with us on the E.E.V.
Does the company know
It all goes into the computer and gets sent back to network
And they want it
I hurt
Do me a favor
Disconnect me
I could be reworked, but I'll never be top of the line again
I'd rather be nothing
You're sure
It wasn't me
I didn't do it
It wasIt was the dragon
Feeds on minds
What about Boggs and Rains
It wasn't me
It wasn't me
Stark raving mad
I'm not saying it was anyone's fault, but he should have been chained up
You called it, sir
Mad as a fucking hatter
Keep him separated from the rest
Clemens, sedate this poor idiot
Yeah
Not until we know about the brothers
Pull yourself together
Talk to me now
Now, where are Boggs and Rains
gonna get anything out of him
It wasn't me
We'll have to send out a search team
I'm afraid we'll have to assume there's a very good chance...  this simple bastard has murdered them
Now, you don't know that
He's crazy, he's a fool, but he's not a liar
He's telling the truth
I'd like to talk to him about thisthis dragon
[ Andrews ] You're not talking to anyone, Lieutenant
I'm not interested in your opinion,  because you are not in full possession of the facts
Isn't that right, Mr. Dillon
Yeah
That part's right
Then I'll talk to you
When I have finished with my official duties,  I will be quite pleased to have a little chat, yes
Let me see if I have this correct, Lieutenant
It's an eightfoot creature of some kind,  with acid for blood, and it arrived on your spaceship
It kills on sight and is generally unpleasant
And, of course, you expect me to accept all this on your word
No, I don't expect anything
Quite a story, Mr. Aaron
Right, sir
Never heard anything quite like it, sir
Expect not
Tell me, Lieutenant, what would you suggest we do
Well, what kind of weapons have you got
What keeps them from killing you
Fear
There's no way to escape
With the arrival of the next supply ship, the company would eliminate them
This is a maximum security prison,  and you have no weapons of any kind
We have some carving knives in the abattoir
A few more in the mess hall
Some fire axes scattered about the place
That's all
We're on the honor system
Then we're fucked
No, you're fucked
Quarantined
Mr. Aaron will escort you
I think you'll be safe from any large, nasty beast while you're there, right
Yes, that's a good girl
Superintendent Andrews wants a meeting
Isn't there any way off of this place
Some way to escape
No
Supply ship comes every six months
Mmhmm
Fuck
They are sending somebody to pick you up quite soon, I gather
Really
[ Coughs ] What's "soon"
I don't know
Nobody's ever been in a hurry to get here before
You'll just say I'm crazy
That's a bit uncharitable
[ Inhales, Coughing ]  How are you feeling
Sore throat
Pissed off
Well, that's understandable given the circumstances
Perhaps I should give you one of my special cocktails
blames everybody for everything
Nobody's persect, only human
There's no such thing as a perfect human
That's very profound, Golic
Thank you
You married
Me
You should get married, have kids
Pretty girl
They used to like me
For a while
You're gonna die too
What
Just curious
No
How about leveling with me
Could you be more specific
When I asked how you got assigned here, you avoided the question
And then when I asked about the prison I.D
tattooed on the back of your head,  you ducked me again
Lt's a long, sad story...  and more than a little melodramatic
If you insist
After my student years,  despite the fact that I had become...  secretly addicted to morphine,  I was considered to be most promising,  a man with a future
So, I went out and I got more than a little drunk
Then I got called back
Boiler had blown on a fuel plant,  and there were 30 casualties
And 1 1 of them died
Not as a result of the accident...  but because I prescribed the wrong dosage of painkiller
At least I got off the morphine
L'm sorry
L think I was let off lightly
Did you serve your time here
So when they stayed, I stayed
Nobody else would employ me
Magnificent
Give us strength, O Lord, to endure
We recognize that we are poor sinners in the hands of an angry God
Let the circle be unbroken until the day
Amen
What the fuck is this bullshit that's comin' down
We got murder
We got brothers in trouble
I don't want no more bullshit around here
Now, we got problems, we stand together
Yes
Thank you, Mr. Dillon
All right
Here are the facts
At 0800 hours, prisoner Murphy,  through carelessness on his part,  was found dead in vent shaft 1 7
He seems to have been sucked into a ventilator fan
At about 21 00 hours,  prisoner Golic reappeared in a deranged state
There seems to be a good chance that they have met with foul play...  at the hands of prisoner Golic
We need to organize and send out a search party
Volunteers will be appreciated
I think it's fair to say that our smoothly running facility...  has suddenly developed a few problems
Lt's here
It got Clemens
Stop this raving at once
I'm telling you, it's here
Aaron, get that foolish woman back to the infirmary
[ Screams ]  [ All Shouting ]   Out of my way
Fuck
Your wrath has come, and the time is near for us to be judged
The apocalypse is upon us
Let us be ready
Let your mercy be just
It was massive
Amen
L was there
I saw it
What the fuck do we do now
Organize
We gotta organize, right
Well, I guess I'm next in line
85's gonna be in charge
Jesus, give us a break
Don't call me that
no way I can replace Andrews
I know you guys didn't appreciate him
Aaron, we don't want to hear that shit now
Hey, sister, what about you
You're an officer
How about showing us a little leadership
Forget fucking Shirley Temple
Right
You run things here anyway
No fuckin' way
I'm not the officer type
Well, what does this fucking beast want
Is this mother gonna try for us all
Well, ain't that sweet
So how are we gonna stop it
[ Clears Throat ]   We have no weapons
Is that correct
Right
I haven't seen one exactly like this before
But the others were afraid of fire  not much else
Can we seal off this area
No chance
The installation's 1 0 miles square
There's 600 air ducts running to the surface
I see these closedcircuit monitors everywhere
We could try to find it that way
The video system hasn't worked in years
We got a lot of technology, no way to fix it
What 85 is trying to tell you is  Don't call me that
We ain't got no entertainment center, no climate control,  no video system, no surveillance,  no freezers, no fucking ice cream,  no rubbers, no women, no guns
All we got here is shit
Oh, what the hell are we even talking to her for
Why don't we just get her head and shove it through the fucking wall
That sounds good to me
Why don't you shut the fuck up
Right
What are we going to do
What's this
Um,  that leads from the mess hall to the infirmary
It's a ventilation shaft
Hey
Hey, look, there's miles and miles of tunnel through there
It won't go far
It'll nest in this area
Right around...  here
How do you know that
It's like a lion
It sticks close to the zebras
Oh, right
Running around down here in the darkAre you kidding
Once you get out of this main shaft, there's no overheads
Don't we have flashlights
We got thousands of 'em, but no batteries
Torches
Do we have the capacity to make fire
Most humans have enjoyed that privilege since the Stone Age
No need to be sarcastic
Never been used
They were gonna dump a lot of nuclear crap in there
It's clean as a whistle inside
This the only way in or out
That's right
Walls are six feet thick, solid steel
You're saying we get something in there,  there's no way it can get out
That's right
No fucking way
This is where we keep it
Quinitricetyline
L knew that
I've got to get these section arrangements organized with Dillon...  for the paintbrush, uh  So, um David
Yeah
You can get these drums organized
And, uh, don't call me that
What's this "85" thing
Couple of us sneaked a look at his personnel file the day he arrived
Lt's his I.Q
I saw a drum of this stuff...  fall into a beachhead bunker once
The blast put a tug in dry dock for 1 7 weeks
Great stuff
Let me get this straight
You want to burn it down and out of the pipes,  force it in here, slam the door...  and trap its ass
Right
You got something better to do
Why should we put our ass on the line for you
Your ass is already on the line
The only question is...  what are you gonna do about it
There's only one of these fucking batteries in 2,000 that works
Hey, it could have been a lot worse
Yeah
We might have got the paintbrush detail
This shit smells awful
Then don't breathe the fucking fumes
I'm in a fucking pipe with it
I mean, don't breathe too hard
You'll get high
That's good for me
So you miss Doc, right
I thought you two got real close
I guess you've been looking through some keyholes
That's what I thought
Oh
You okay
Yeah
l'm fine
L'm fine
I hate this place
I hate this place
Well
Okay
Don't light the fire until I give the signal
Got it
Can you remember that
Buh  Wait for the fucking signal
Aaah
Come on, come on
We gotta find the sprinklers
Come on
We gotta help these guys
Move
Move
Go to the waste dump
Oh, God
It's all right
It's all right
You're gonna be all right
We got you
Fire's out
[ Screaming Continues ]  Junior
We gotta get him out of here
Come on
We're walking you out
Junior
Behind you
Open the door
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come and get me, fucker
â™ª â™ª [ Woman Vocalizing ]  Even for those who have fallen,  this is a time of rejoicing
They will live forever
Those that are dead are not dead
They have moved up
They have moved to a higher place
Crazy bastards
Keeps 'em out of mischief
You're not the religious type
Me
I've got a job
They open the door, go in there with smart guns and kill it
What have you heard from them
Nothing much
We got a message received
Later, we got something that said you were top priority
They don't cut us in on much
What if they don't want to kill it
Take it back
Yeah
They're not lunatics, you know
Right
Morse, please, cut me loose
No fucking way
Come on, man
It hurts
Oh, sorry
I haven't done nothing
Just don't talk to me
Please
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna sit here and guard your ass like l'm supposed to
I don't need any fucking trouble with Dillon
All I did was tell 'em about the dragon, what it did to Boggs and Rains
You saw it
Fuckin' "A" I saw it
Oh, please
I can't run
It's not going to get in here
We got it trapped
So what's the big deal
Come on
Let me loose, man
Yeah
Aren't I your friend
I love you, Morse
[ Trimmer Clatters ]  Why not
No fucking around...  or I'll get nothing but shit
So where they got it
[ Chuckles ] In the waste tank
Gotta see it again
What the fuck you talking about
No more cigarettes for you
Right
We got the first part
Tell them we trapped it
What do we call it
A xenomorph
Right
Here
Hey, wait a minute
We can't kill it
We don't have any weapons, right
That's all they ever tell us
Treat us like shit
Off and on me now
What the hell you talking about
Talk to me, the beast
You can't go in there, dickhead
Sorry
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
â™ª â™ª [ Vocalizing Continues ]   So, you're telling me they're coming to take this thing away
Yeah, they're gonna try
They don't wanna kill it
We gotta figure out a way to do it before they come here
Why do we have to kill it
You just said the company's coming for it
That's right
Some sort of weapon
Yeah, what's wrong with that
They can't control it
They don't understand
Like I said, what's wrong with that
were a religious man
You don't understand, do you
That world out there doesn't exist for us anymore
We've got our own little world out here
It ain't much, but it's ours
So fuck everybody else
Fuck them
Hey, Dillon
Yeah
Miserable, crazy son of a bitch let him loose
Got what he fucking deserved
Well, now what are we gonna do
Andrews was right
[ Gasps ]  You okay
Piss on her
The fucking thing's loose out there
What are we gonna do
L just said that
And you're the dumb prick that let Golic out
You miserable little shit
Cut that shit out
Tell your fucking bozo to shape up
have to get to the E.E.V
Why
What's up
I just have to use the neuroscanner
You don't look so good
What are we gonna do
Want a smack in the mouth, you stupid wanker
Shut the fuck up and stop causing panic
PanicYou're so fucking stupid, you couldn't spell it
Don't talk to me about panic
We're fucking screwed
All right
Now shut up, both of you
Shut up
Well, I'm out of ideas
Oh, surprise me
What about outside
Great idea
The rescue team's 1 0 hours away
So that makes a lot of sense
Wonderful
You just want us to stay here and let this thing have us for lunch
I want you to get everybody that's still left together
Get 'em into the assembly hall
Okay
Need any help
[ Exhales ]  I don't mean to scare you
Do me a favor and run this keyboard, will you
Okay
What do I do
Hit "B" or "C."  What's "C"
"Display biofunctions.
That's it
Now what
Hit "enhancement.
Keep looking
I don't know how to read this stuff
Hemorrhaging will show as a dark patch
hairline fractures through the base of the skull
What is it
I think you've got one inside of you
That's not possible
What does it look like
I have to see it
Freeze it
You don't want to look at it
Freeze it
l'm sorry
All right
The fucking thing is loose
A rescue team is on its way with guns and shit
Right now there isn't any place that's real safe
But we stay here, in the assembly hall
This place never had any fucking air conditioning
In the meantime, you lay low, be ready and stay right...  in case your time comes
Don't you start bullshitting, Dillon
We're gonna be trapped in here like rats
You got a weapon
You got a blade
Then you take it out and you fucking use it
So you think we're gonna stab this mothersucker to death
No, I don't think shit
Maybe
Maybe you'll hurt it before it takes you out, huh
Isn't that something
And I'll tell you, until the rescue team gets here, we're fucked
So you better get prepared
Well, I ain't staying here
Well, then, suit yourself
Fire
Yeah
Holy shit
Well, all right
Fuckin' "A.
Fuckin' "A.
It's up
What do you want to say
Tell them the whole place has gone toxic
Are you kidding
Then they won't come here
Yeah
I know
What are you talking about
Our only hope is that they kill this fucker
I don't know, freeze you  They can do an operation
They've got the technology
If this organism gets off the planet, it'll kill everything
They just want it for their bioweapons division, okay
So we can't let them come here
Fuck you
Look, I'm sorry you've got this thing inside you, but l'm getting rescued
I don't give a shit about these stupid prisoners, but l've got a wife, a kid
I'll go home on the next rotation
This is hard
I'm gonna send this message
I'm sorry, babe
It's classified
Listen, you stupid little shit
This has got to be done, okay
No way
You're not getting it
No fucking way
Understand
I think you're okay
Ah
Thanks
Have you got any ideas
[ Exhales ]  It won't kill me
I'm carrying the new queen
You really wanna bet this thing's that smart
Maybe I'll go find it
See how smart it is
You're gonna go and look for it
I have a pretty good idea of where it is
It's just down there... in the basement
It's a metaphor
Wanna come
Where are you when I need you
Don't be afraid
You've been in my life so long,  I can't remember anything else
Now do something for me
It's easy
Just  Just do what you do
Oh
It won't kill me
You're supposed to be laying low
I have one inside of me
Big one won't kill its own
What are you talking about
I just saw it,  an hour ago
I could've been lunch, but it wouldn't touch me
It ran away
It knows I'm carrying its future
Aw, bullshit
I saw it... on the CAT scan
It's a queenan egg layer
Still sounds like bullshit to me
If that thing's inside you, how'd it get there
When I was in hypersleep, I guess
L was violated
Now I get to be the mother
I need you to help me
I need you to kill me
I'm dead anyway
I can't survive it
But the one inside of me can generate thousands more,  can wipe out the whole universe
Lt has to die
So somebody's gotta kill me
Are you up to it
No speeches
No prayers
I don't like losing a fight
Not to nobody, not to nothing
Fuck
That damn thing out there has already killed half my men,  got the other half scared shitless
As long as it's alive, sister, you're not gonna save any universe
You fucking coward
I want that thing
I want to get this thing, and I need you to do it
Otherwise, fuck you
Go kill yourself
We waste this thing,  then you take care of me
No problem
Quick, easy and painless
This is the choice
At least we take a shot
We owe it one
It's fucked us up
Maybe we can get even for the others
Now how do you want it
I'm talkin' about killing that big motherfucker
The rescue team's on its way
We could just sit this out
[ Ripley ] Rescue team for whom
For us
They just want the beast
I don't give a damn what they want
They're not gonna pick us off one by one, are they
I wouldn't be so sure
Come on
They're gonna take us home
They're not gonna take us home
Jesus Christ
Give us a break
You guys have got to be fucking nuts
Look, I've got a wife and a kid
You're not one of us
You're not a believer
You're a fucking company man
Okay, I'm a company man and not a fucking criminal
Well, I'm smart enough not to have a life sentence on this rock
Fuck you
Piss off, 85
Yeah, and I'm smart enough to wait for some firepower to show up before we fight this thing
Right, Morse
Right
Okay
Just sit here on your asses
How about if I sit here on my ass
No problem
Oh, I forgot
You're the guy that's made a deal with God...  to live forever, huh
Me and her'll do all the fighting
Okay
I want to see it dead
I hate the fucker
Why the fuck can't we wait for the company and have some guns on our side
Why do we have to go on some fucking suicide run
Right
Because they won't kill it
They might kill you just for having seen it
But they're not gonna kill it
That is crazy
That is horseshit
The next time they sent in marines
They were expendable too
What makes you think they're gonna care about a bunch of lifers...  who found God at the ass end of space
You really think they're going to let you...  interfere with their plans for this thing
They think we'rewe're crud
And they don't give a fuck about one friend of yours...  that'sthat's died
Have you got some sort of plan
This is a lead works, isn't it
All we got to do is lure the fucking beast into the mold,  drown it in hot lead
All right
So how do we do that
What are we gonna use for bait
We're all gonna die
The only question is when
This is as good a place as any...  to take your first steps to heaven
Only question is how you check out
Do you want it on your feet...  or on your fucking knees, begging
I ain't much for begging
So I say fuck that thing
Let's fight it
Fuck it
Let's go for it
What if it runs at us
That's a fucking good idea
Channel "A," Door 1 open
We fired it up five, six years ago
You sure the piston's gonna work
There's nothing for sure in this place
We trap it here first, then you pull the lever, start the piston
Then the piston's gonna push the mothersucker right into the mold
Then one of the guys will pour the lead
End of story
What if somebody screws it up
You got one chance
One shot at it
That's all
We'll never have time to reset it
Now remember, when you pull the lever,  for a few seconds you're gonna be trapped in here with that fuckin' thing
If you guys don't drop the ball, I won't
Well, you just better be right about that thing not wanting you
Where are you gonna be
I'll be around
What about the others
Where are they
Praying
You believe in this heaven shit
I don't know
Me neither
Fuck it, though
What else have we got to believe in
Say that for fucking sure
WellHey
Silence
I can't hear   Let's launch this thing
Channel "B," Door 7
Hey, guys
My door ain't working
What the fuck's he saying
Did anybody hear anything
Come on
Come and get me, you fucker
It's behind me
Still behind me
It's in Channel "B"
Still coming
Shut the doors
This thing is really pissed off
Did you say "B"
No, "E"
But you said we should stay here
Move your fucking ass
Morse
I think I found Vincent
Yoohoo
Hey, fuckface
Come and get me
A7 closed
Open the east wing
Door B7 safe
You cool
Okay
Over to "E," everybody
Where the fuck is "E"
This way
Troy
Troy
Troy, help 'em
Where the hell are they going
Look, you're immune, they're not
So what are we doing
Improvising
We're improvising
Great
Here
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty
Oh, my God
Oh, myYou bastard
[ Hissing ]  It's coming
It's coming, Dillon
It's comin' after us
Shut the fucking doors
That was the plan
Dillon
Anybody
This is not a drill
Kevin
Gregor
Where the fuck are you
Come on
Door 3, "F" Channel closed
I hope
What the fuck are you doing

Hold it like this
What the fuck  You'll fucking kill someone, you fucking moron
Ow
[ Hissing ]  [ Screams ]   Morse
Kevin
[ Screams ]  Gregor
All they have to do is run down the damn corridor
Where the hell is it
[ Hissing ]  [ Screams ]  It's coming
Aw, Jesus
No
No
[ Grunting ]  No
What are you doing
No
[ Stammering ]   Okay
Okay
What the heck
All right
Kevin
Don't struggle
Don't move
Don't struggle
[ Grunts ]  Come on
Come on, Kevin
Come on
Come on
Come on
The doors
It's coming
Take the piston
It's all right
It's okay
It's okay
It's all right, Kevin
Kevin
Leave him
He's dead
Lure it in
How much time
Four or five minutes
But we've got to get it back in here before the piston seals this place off
Now, let's move it
[ Gasps ]       Help me
Jude
Dillon
Help me, Dillon
Don't look back, Jude
Run as fast as you fucking can
God
Help
Door 3 closed
[ Panting ]   Jesus Christ
Warder Aaron, sir
1 3751 2
Not many of us left, sir
Where is Lieutenant Ripley
If she's alive, she's in the furnace
She's in the lead works with the beast
Wouldn't wait
Jesus Christ
Scared me shitless
[ Laughing ]  I thought you were the fucking beast
You fuck
Move
Come on
Come on, get out of there
Come here
Ripley, we're running out of time
Ripley, where are you
[ Grunting ]   [ Tail Whipping ]  [ Grunts, Screams ]   No
Get out of there
What the fuck is wrong with you
No
Let it go
Let it go
Yes
It's working
Scream
Scream
Come on
We got to get it in front of the piston
Get back there
It's following us
Come on
Come and get us
Up to the door
Close it
Come on, motherfucker
Come on
Get the door
Get the door
Morse
Now
Shut it
Now
Shut the fucking door
[ Hisses ]  I'm going for the lead
Go
What about you
I'm staying
Bullshit
There's gonna be 1 0 tons of hot lead in there
I keep telling you, I want to die
We got a deal
It dies first, then you
I'm not gonna move without you
Now get going
Dillon
What about me
God will take care of you now, sister
Pour the lead
Fuck you
[ Hisses ]  Go on
Pour it, Ripley
Go on
Damn it
Pour it now
Come on
Come on
That's all you've got
Come on
Morse
Morse, over here
Ripley
Pour the lead
Pour the lead
[ Grunting ]  [ Grunting ]   I hate bugs
It's burning hot
Hit the sprinklers
Douse the fucker
[ Hissing ]  [ Grunts ]   Gotcha
[ Ripley ] Don't come any closer
Wait
They're here to help
Ripley
Bishop
I'm here to help you
No more bullshit
I just felt it move
You know who I am
You're a droid
Sent by the fucking company
No
I designed it
I'm very human
The company sent me here to show you a friendly face,  to demonstrate how important you are to us,  to me
You just want to take it back
We want to kill it and take you home
You're wrong
We want to help
We're gonna take that out of you
And keep it
Can't allow it to live
Everything we know would be in jeopardy
Ripley, time is important
Let us deal with the malignancy
We've got a surgical bay set up on the rescue ship
Come with me
It's very quick
Painless
A couple of incisions
And then it's over
You still can have a life, children  And most important, you'll know it's dead
What guarantee do I have...  once you've taken it out, you'll destroy it
You have to trust me
Please
Trust me
What's this gonna achieve
[ Screams ]   Stop
Ow
Oh, Jesus
Will you help me
What do you want me to do
There was no need for any of it
Fucking android
I'm not a droid
It's the chance of a lifetime
You must let me have it
It's a magnificent specimen
Oh, Jesus
No pictures
What are you doing
No
Come on, you
Oh, fuck you
Ash, Captain Dallas are dead
Cargo and ship destroyed
I should reach the frontier in about six weeks

Do you have a speech for the occasion
<i>With a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels.</i>  I can't think of anything
<i>For a second, I forget about Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>  <i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>  It's getting exciting now
Think of everything we've accomplished
<i>Suddenly I realize that all of this, the gun, the bombs, the revolution,</i>  <i>has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>  <i>Bob
Bob had bitch tits.</i>  <i>This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.</i>  <i>The big moosie slobbering all over me, that was Bob.</i>  We're still men
Yes, we're men
Men is what we are
Then hormone therapy.</i>  <i>He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high</i>  <i>and his body upped the oestrogen.</i>  <i> That was where I fit..
They'll have to drain my pecs again.</i>  <i>..between those huge sweating tits</i>  <i>that hung enormous, the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>  OK, you cry now
<i>No, wait

<i>It must have been Tuesday

Prioritize these
Here's your flight coupons

I'd like to order  the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles

<i>Red and blue Tuinals, lipstickred Seconals...</i>  No
You need healthy, natural sleep
Chew some valerian root and get more exercise
I'm in pain
You wanna see pain
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights
See the guys with testicular cancer
That's pain
I always wanted three kids... two boys and a girl
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy
Well, I... She...  She had her first child last week
With... With her... With her new husband
Fuck
Thank God, you know..
I'm glad for her
Thank you, Thomas
I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage
And that gives me strength
It's time for the oneonones
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example and really open ourselves up
Could you find a partner
<i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>  <i>His eyes already shrinkwrapped in tears.</i>  <i>Knees together
Those awkward little steps.</i>   My name is Bob
Bob
<i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>  <i>You know that chest expansion programme on latenight TV?</i>  <i>That was his idea.</i>  I was a juicer
Diabonal and  Wisterol
Oh, they use that on racehorses, for Christ sakes
I'm divorced
My two grown kids  won't even return my phone calls
<i>Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>  Go ahead,... Cornelius
You can cry
I let go.</i>  That's really good
<i>Lost in oblivion.</i>  <i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>  <i>I found freedom
Losing all hope was freedom.</i>  It's OK.  <i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>  <i>I became addicted.</i>  If I didn't say anything  people always assumed the worst
They cried harder... then I cried harder
It moves over your body, healing you
Now keep this going
Remember to breathe  and step forward through the back door of the room
Where does it lead
To your cave
That's right
You're going deeper into your cave
And you're going to find  your power animal

<i>Every evening I died.</i>  <i>And every evening I was born again.</i>  <i>Resurrected.</i>  <i>Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too.</i>  <i>Being there, pressed against his tits,</i>  <i>ready to cry.</i>  <i>This was my vacation.</i>  <i>And she</i>  <i>ruined everything.</i>  This is cancer, right
<i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i>  <i>did not have testicular cancer.</i>  <i>She was a liar.</i>  <i>She had no diseases at all.</i>  <i>I had seen her at Free And Clear, my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>  <i>Then at Hope, my bimonthly sicklecell circle.</i>  <i>And again, at Seize The Day, my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>  <i>Marla,</i>  <i>the big tourist.</i>  <i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>  <i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>  <i>I couldn't cry

But I don't know for how long
That's as much certainty as anyone can give me
I no longer have any fear of death
But..
I am in a pretty lonely place
I'm so close to the end, and all I want is to get laid for the last time
I have pornographic movies in my apartment,   and lubricants and amyl nitrite
Thank you, Chloe
Everyone, let's thank Chloe
Thank you, Chloe
You're standing at the entrance of your cave
You step inside your cave and you walk...  <i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>  <i>Marla.</i>  <i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.</i>  <i>But you can't.</i>  <i>..deeper into your cave as you walk.</i>  <i>You feel a healing energy all around you.</i>  <i>Now find your power animal.</i>  Slide
OK. Let's partner up
Pick someone special to you tonight
Hey
We need to talk
What
Yeah
You're a faker
You're not dying
Sorry
In the Tibetanphilosophy, SylviaPlath sense of the word, I know we're all dying
But you're not dying the way Chloe is
So
I've seen you
I saw you at melanoma, I saw you at tuberculosis
I saw you practising this
Practising what
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert
I'll expose you
Go ahead
I'll expose you
Come together
Let yourselves cry
Oh, God
It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee
Look, this is important
These are my groups
I've been coming for over a year
I don't know
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak
Yeah
Yeah
Share yourself... completely
Look, you don't want to get into this
Really
I'm not kidding
I can't cry if another faker is present, and I need this
You gotta find somewhere else to go
Candystripe a cancer ward
It's not my problem
Hold on
We'll split up the week, OK
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis
You take tuberculosis
OK. Good
Fine
Testicular cancer should be no contest
Technically, I have more right to be there
You still have your balls
I dunno
Am I
No
What do you want
I'll take the parasites
Take the blood parasites
I want brain parasites
I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia
You can't have the whole brain
So far, you have four
I only have two
OK. Take both the parasites
They're yours
Now we both have three...  Hey
You left half your clothes
What, are you selling those
I'm selling some clothes
We each have three
That's six
What about the seventh day
I want bowel cancer
<i>The girl had done her homework.</i>  No
I want bowel cancer
That's your favorite too
Tried to slip it by me, eh
Look, we'll split it
Deal
Looks like this is goodbye
Let's not make a big thing out of it
How's this for not making a big thing
Hey, Marla
Marla
We might wanna switch nights
OK.  <i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>  <i>Marla's philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.</i>  <i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>  It doesn't have your name
Who are you
Cornelius
Rupert
Travis
Any of the stupid names you give each night
<i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>  <i>SFO
Mountain
Central
Lose an hour
<i>This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>  <i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>  <i>If you wake up at a different time, in a different place,</i>  <i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>  <i>Everywhere I travel,</i>  <i>tiny life.</i>  <i>Singleserving sugar and cream.</i>  <i>Single pat of butter.</i>  <i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>  <i>Shampooconditioner combos.</i>  <i>Samplepackage mouthwash
Tiny bars of soap.</i>  <i>The people I meet on each flight,</i>  <i>they're singleserving friends.</i>  <i>Between takeoff and landing, we have our time together.</i>  <i>That's all we get.</i>  <i>Welcome!</i>  <i>On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>  <i>I was a recall coordinator
My job was to apply the formula.</i>  The infant went through the windshield
<i>A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>  <i>The rear differential locks up.</i>  The teenager's braces are stuck to the ashtray
<i>The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.</i>  <i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>  The father must have been huge
See where the fat burned to the seat
Very modern art
<i>Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.</i>  <i>Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.</i>  <i>Multiply the result by the average outofcourt settlement, C.</i>  <i>A x B x C</i>  equals X
If X is less than the cost of a recall,  we don't do one
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents
You wouldn't believe
A major one
<i>Every time the plane banked too sharply on takeoff or landing,</i>  <i>I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.</i>  <i>Anything.</i>  <i>Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.</i>  "If you are seated in an emergency exit row  and would be unable or unwilling to perform the duties  listed on the safety card, please ask a flight attendant to reseat you.
Wanna switch seats
No
I'm not sure I'm the man for that particularjob
An exitdoor procedure at 30,000ft
The illusion of safety
Yeah
I guess so
So you can breathe
Oxygen gets you high
In a catastrophic emergency, you take giant panic breaths
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile
You accept your fate
Blank faces
Calm as Hindu cows
That's...  That's an interesting theory
What do you do
What do you mean
Why
So you can pretend you're interested
OK.  You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh
Soap
Sorry
I make and I sell soap
The yardstick of civilization
<i>And this is how I met...</i>  Tyler Durden
Did you know if you mix gasoline and frozen orange juice, you can make napalm
No, I did not
Is that true
One can make all kinds of explosives with simple household items
Really
If one was so inclined
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting singleserving friend I have ever met
Very clever
How's it working out for you
What
Being clever
Great
Right up
A question of etiquette
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch
<i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>  <i>Airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.</i>   Was it ticking
Throwers know modern bombs don't tick
Sorry, throwers
Baggage handlers
My suitcase was vibrating
Nine times out of ten  it's an electric razor
But... every once in a while  it's a dildo
<i>We have to use the indefinite article, a dildo, never</i>  <i>your dildo.</i>  I don't own...  <i>I had everything in that suitcase
My CK shirts.</i>  <i>My DKNYshoes
My AX ties.</i>  <i>Never mind.</i>  Hey
That's my car
<i>Home was a condo on the 15th floor</i>  <i>of a filing cabinet for widows and professionals.</i>  <i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>  <i>A foot of concrete is important</i>  <i>when your nextdoor neighbor has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>  <i>Or when a blast of debris that used to be your personal effects</i>  <i>blows out of your windows and sails flaming into the night.</i>  <i>I suppose these things happen.</i>  There's... nothing up there
Police orders
Do you have somebody you can call
Who's this?</i>  <i> Tyler
Who is this?</i>  We met... We met on the airplane
We had the same suitcase
The clever guy
Right.</i>  I called a second ago
There was no answer
<i> I'm at a payphone
Yeah, I *69'd you
I never pick up my phone.</i>  <i>So what's up?</i>  Well
You know, it could be worse
A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep and toss it out of a car
There's always that
When you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that's it
That's the last sofa I'll need
Whatever happens, that sofa problem is handled
I had it all
I had a stereo that was very decent
I was close to being complete
Shit, man
Now it's all gone
All gone
All gone
A comforter
Just a blanket
Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is
Is this essential to our survival in the huntergatherer sense
No
I dunno
Consumers
Right
We're consumers
We are byproducts of a lifestyle obsession
These things don't concern me
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,  television with 500 channels,  some guy's name on my underwear
Viagra
Olestra
Martha Stewart
Fuck Martha Stewart
It's all going down
So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns
I say never be complete
I say stop being perfect
I say let's evolve
Let the chips fall where they may
But that's me, and I could be wrong
It's just stuff
Not a tragedy...  You did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living
Fuck, you're right
I don't smoke
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...  What
Do what you like, man
Oh, it's late
Hey, thanks for the beer
Yeah, man
What
What
A hotel
Yeah
What are you talking about
Oh, God
Three pitchers of beer and you still can't ask
You called me because you needed a place to stay
Oh, hey
Yes, you did
So just ask
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man
Would... Would that be a problem
Is it a problem for you to ask
Yeah
Thanks
I want you to do me a favor
Yeah, sure
I want you to hit me as hard as you can
What
<i>Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.</i>  <i>Tyler was a night person.</i>  While the rest of us slept, he worked
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel
It comes on a few
Someone has to switch the projectors at the exact moment  that one reel ends and the next one begins
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns
That's the cue for a changeover
He flips the projectors, movie keeps going and the audience has no idea
Why would anyone want this shitjob
Because it affords him interesting opportunities
Like splicing a frame of pornography into family films
So when the snooty cat and the courageous dog with the celebrity voices first meet,  that's when you'll catch a flash of Tyler's contribution to the film
Nice, big cock
Even a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work
<i>He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.</i>  Do not watch
I cannot go when you watch
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque, he farted on meringues,  and as for the cream of mushroom soup...  Go ahead, tell 'em
You just want me to hit you
Come on
Do me this one favor
Why
I don't know
Never been in a fight
You
But that's a good thing
I don't wanna die without any scars
Come on
Hit me, before I lose my nerve
Oh, God
This is crazy
Let it rip
I don't know about this
I don't either
Who gives a shit
Noone's watching
What do you care
This is crazy
That's right
Where
Like, in the face
This is so fucking stupid
Motherfucker
He hit me in the ear
Well, Jesus, I'm sorry
Why the ear, man
No, that was perfect
No, it's all right
It really hurts
Right
Hit me again
No, you hit me
We should do this again sometime
Where's your car
What car
That's you
That's me
That's the toilet
Good
Yeah, thanks
<i>What a shithole.</i>  <i>Nothing worked.</i>  <i>Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.</i>  <i>There were no neighbors
Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>  <i>That fart smell of steam
Hey, guys
Hey
<i>Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.</i>  <i>By the end of the first month, I didn't miss TV.</i>  <i>I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.</i>  Can I be next
Lose the tie
<i>At night, Tyler and I were alone for half a mile in every direction.</i>  <i>Rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>  <i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>  <i>Everywhere were rusted nails to snag your elbow on.</i>  <i>The previous occupant had been a shutin.</i>  Hey, man
What are you reading
Listen to this
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata
Without me,  Jack could not regulate his heart rate or breathing.
There's a whole series of these
"I Am Jill's Nipples.
"I Am Jack's Colon.
I Kill Jack.
<i> You could deal with anything
Have you finished those reports?</i>  <i>If you could choose, who would you fight?</i>  I'd fight my boss, probably
Really
Yeah, why
I'd fight my dad
I don't know my dad
I mean, I know him, but..
He left when I was like, six years old
He did this every six years
He changes city and starts a new family
Fucker's setting up franchises
So it was real important that I go
That sounds familiar
So I graduate
Call him up longdistance and say, "Dad, now what?
He says, "Get ajob.
Same here
Make my yearly call again
"Dad, now what?
He says, "I dunno
Get married.
You can't get married
I'm a 30yearold boy
I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need
<i>Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>  <i>But every Saturday night, we were finding something out.</i>  <i>We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.</i>  <i>It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>  <i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>  <i>I should have been looking for a new condo or haggling with my insurance company.</i>  <i>I should have been upset about my nice flaming little shit.</i>  <i>But I wasn't.</i>  The premise of cybernetting an office is make things more efficient
<i>Monday mornings, I just thought about next week.</i>  Can I get the icon in cornflower blue
Absolutely
Because waste is a thief
You liked it, didn't you
<i>You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.</i>  <i>It was right in everyone's face.</i>  <i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>  <i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.</i>  <i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>  Come on, you've gotta go home
Turn off the jukebox
Lock the back
<i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.</i>  Gentlemen
Welcome to Fight Club
The first rule of Fight Club is  you do not talk about Fight Club
Third rule of Fight Club
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,  the fight is over
Only two guys to a fight
Fifth rule
One fight at a time, fellas
Sixth rule
No shirts
Seventh rule
Fights will go on as long as they have to
And the eighth and final rule
If this is your first night at Fight Club  you have to fight
<i>You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.</i>  <i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>  <i>Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight,</i>  <i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>  <i>Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were outside of it.</i>  <i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time
Alive or dead
Doesn't matter
Who'd be tough
Hemingway
You
Shatner
I'd fight William Shatner
Oh, selfimprovement is masturbation
Now, selfdestruction..
Excuse me
Stop
<i>When the fight was over, nothing was solved.</i>  <i>But nothing mattered.</i>  Cool
<i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>  Hey, man
How about next week
How about next month?
New guy, you too
<i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>  He fell down some stairs
I fell down some stairs
<i>Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>  OK. Any historical figure
Good answer
How about you
Lincoln
Lincoln
Big guy, big reach
Fuck
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart
Hello
You left a forwarding number.</i>  I haven't seen you at any support groups
<i>We split 'em up
That was the idea
Remember?</i>  Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours
How do you know
I found a new one
Really
It's for men only
Like the testicle thing
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous
I'm on my way out.</i>  Me too
I've got a stomach full of Xanax
I took what was left of a bottle
It might have been too much
<i>Picture Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.</i>  This isn't a forreal suicide thing
So you're staying in tonight, then
Do you wanna wait and hear me describe death
<i>Do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>  <i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>  <i>Tyler's door was closed
I'd been here for two months and his door was never closed.</i>  You won't believe this dream I had last night
I can hardly believe anything about last night
What
This is my house
What are you doing here
Fuck you
Oh, you've got some fuckedup friends
Silly cooze
I come in last night
Phone's off the hook
<i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>  <i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>  Do you think it'll live up to its name
<i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>  <i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>  <i>Ten,</i>  <i>nine,... eight...</i>  <i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i>  <i>think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>  <i>Five,</i>  <i>four...</i>  Hang on
You got here fast
Did I call you
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic
It's not a threat to you
Oh, fuck
Somebody called the cops
End of the hall
The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl
She has lost faith in herself
She's a monster
You have every reason to live
She's infectious human waste
Miss Singer
If I fall asleep,  I'm done for
You're gonna have to keep me up  all night
Unfuckingbelievable
<i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>   You know what I mean, you fucked her
No, I didn't
Never
No
God, not at all
<i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>  Are you sure
You can tell me
<i> Put a gun to my head and spray my brains
That's good.</i>  She's a predator posing as a house pet
Stay away
The shit that came out of this woman's mouth, I had never heard
My God
I haven't been fucked like that since grade school
<i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>  <i>The other night, he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.</i>  Marla doesn't need a lover, just a caseworker
This isn't love, it's sport fucking
Sit down
Now, listen
I can't have you talking to her about me
Why would I...  Say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or anybody,... we're done
Now promise me
You promise
OK.   Yeah, I promise
Promise
What...  That's three times you promised
<i>If only I had wasted a few minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>  <i>none of this would have happened.</i>  Harder, yes
<i>I could have moved to another room.</i>  <i>On the third floor where I might not have heard them.</i>  <i>But I didn't.</i>   What are you doing
Just going to bed
Wanna finish her off
No
No, thank you
Who were you talking to
Shut up
<i>I became the calm little center of the world.</i>  <i>I was the Zen master.</i>  <i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>  <i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>  Is that your blood
Some of it, yeah
Take the rest of the day off
Come back Monday with some clean clothes
Get yourself together
"</i>  <i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that
"</i>  <i>"I am enlightened
"</i>  <i>You give up the condo life, give up all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>  <i>move to a dilapidated house in a toxic waste area,</i>  <i>and you have to come home to this.</i>  <i> Hello
This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.</i>  <i>We have some new information about the incident at your former condo.</i>  Yes
<i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>  No, I wasn't aware of that
<i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>  Does this sound strange to you
<i>Yes, sir, strange
Very strange.</i>  <i> The dynamite  Dynamite?</i>  left a residue of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride
No, what does it mean?</i>  It means it was homemade
I'm sorry
This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir
<i> The gas was just a detonator
Who would go and do that?</i>  <i> I'll ask the questions
Tell him.</i>  Tell him the liberator who destroyed my property realigned my perceptions
<i>Excuse me
Are you there?</i>  I am listening
Have you recently made enemies who might have access to homemade dynamite
Enemies
Reject civilization,  especially material possessions
<i> Son, this is serious
Yes, it's very serious.</i>  Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me
That condo was my life
OK
I loved every stick of furniture in that place
I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>  <i> Is this not a good time for you
Just tell him you fucking did it!</i>  Tell him you blew it all up
That's what he wants to hear
<i> Are you still there
Wait
I may need to talk to you, so you let me know if you're gonna leave town
OK.</i>  <i>Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.</i>  <i>My parents pulled this exact same act for years.</i>  The condom is the glass slipper of our generation
You slip one on when you meet a stranger
You... dance all night
Then you throw it away
The condom, I mean
Not the stranger
What
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1
It's a bridesmaid's dress
Someone loved it intensely  for one day
Like a Christmas tree
So special
It's on the side of the road
Tinsel still clinging to it
Like a sex crime victim
Underwear inside out
Bound with electrical tape
Well then, it suits you
Get rid of her
<i> What
You get rid of her
Don't mention me.</i>  <i>I am six years old again, passing messages between parents.</i>   I really think it's time you left
Don't worry, I'm leaving
You are such a nutcase
I can't keep up
Gotta get off  Thanks
Bye
Why do you still waste time with her
<i>At least she's trying to hit bottom.</i>  And I'm not
Feathers up your butt do not make you a chicken
What are we doing tonight
Tonight... we make soap
To make soap, first we render fat
The salt balance has to be just right  so the best fat for soap comes from humans
Wait, what is this place
A liposuction clinic
Richest, creamiest fat in the world
Fat of the land
No
Don't pull it, don't pull it
Oh, God
As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface
Like in Boy Scouts
It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout
Keep stirring
Once the tallow hardens, you skim off a layer of glycerin
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust, you've got dynamite
<i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>  People found clothes got cleaner when washed at a certain point in the river
No
Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river
Bodies burnt
Water permeated the ashes to create lye
This is lye
Once it mixed with the melted body fat, a white soapy discharge crept into the river
May I see your hand, please
What is this
It will hurt more than any burn and it will leave a scar
<i>Meditation worked for cancer, it could work now.</i>   Don't shut the pain out
Oh, God
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes, like the first monkey shot into space
<i>I tried not to think of the word searing of flesh.</i>  Stop it
This is your pain, this is your burning hand
I'm going to my cave to find my power animal
No
Don't deal with this the way those dead people do
I get the point
No
You're feeling premature enlightenment
It's the greatest moment of your life, and you're off somewhere else
Shut up
Our fathers were our models for God
If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God
You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you
He never wanted you
In all probability, He hates you
This is not the worst thing that can happen
We don't need Him
I agree
We are God's unwanted children
So be it
I'm getting water
You can use water and make it worse or...   Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn
First, you have to give up
You don't know how this feels
It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything
OK.  Congratulations
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom
<i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar.</i>  <i>God knows what they charged.</i>   This is the best soap
Why, thank you, Susan
<i>It was beautiful.</i>  <i>We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.</i>  <i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>  <i>I didn't wear a tie to work any more.</i>  "The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club.
<i>I'm halfasleep again
Pretend you're me
Make a managerial decision
What would you do
Well, I gotta tell you,  I'd be very, very careful who you talk to about that
Because the person who wrote that is dangerous
And this buttondown, Oxfordcloth psycho might just snap  and then stalk from office to office  with an Armalite AR10 carbine gaspowered semiautomatic weapon,  pumping round after round into colleagues and coworkers
Someone very, very close to you
<i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>  <i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>  Or maybe you shouldn't bring me every piece of trash you pick up
Compliance and Liability
My tit's gonna rot off
I need to take this
What do you mean
Go to a hospital
I can't afford to waste money on a doctor
I don't know about this, Marla
Please
<i>She didn't call Tyler
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines
Where are they, exactly
Tragically, they're dead
I'm alive and I'm in poverty
Want any
No, no
I got one for you
What happened to your hand
Oh, nothing
Feel anything
No
OK, I'm pretty sure
You feel nothing
No, nothing
Well, that's a relief
Thank you
No problem
I wish I could return the favor
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family
I think I'm OK.  Well, thanks, anyway
Are we done
Yeah, we're done
See you... around
It's me
Bob
Hey, Bob
We all thought you were dead
No, no
Still here
How are you, Bob
Better than I've ever been in my whole life
Still remaining men together
No, no
I got something so much better now
Well..
The first rule is, I'm not supposed to talk about it
And the second rule is  I'm not supposed to talk about it
And the third rule is...  Bob, Bob
Look at my face, Bob
That's fucking... fucking great
I've never seen you there
I go Tuesdays and Thursdays
I go Saturday
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right
Have you heard about the guy that invented it
Yeah, actually..
I hear all kinds of things
He's a great man
Do you know about Tyler Durden
Actually, you did
Thank you for this
<i>Fight Club.</i>  <i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>  <i>Our gift to the world.</i>  I look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces
Shut up
Which means a lot of people have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club
I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived
I see all this potential
And I see it squandered
Goddamn it, an entire generation pumping gas
Waiting tables
Working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need
We're the middle children of history
No purpose or place
We have no Great War
No Great Depression
Our great depression is our lives
We've all been raised on television to believe  that one day we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars
But we won't
We're slowly learning that fact
And we're very, very pissed off
Yeah
Who am I
Yeah
There's a sign on the front that says Lou's Tavern
I'm fucking Lou
Tyler Durden
We have a deal worked out with Irvine
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone
He don't own this place
I do
How much money's he getting for this
There is no money
Free to all
Ain't that something
Look, stupid fuck
I want everybody out of here right now
You should join our club
Did you hear what I just said
You and your friend
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou
Still not getting it
OK, OK, I got it
I got it, I got it
Shit, I lost it
Back
Everybody back
Ah, Lou
Come on, man
We really like this place
That's right, Lou
Shut the fuck up
Oh, yeah
Is that fucking funny
Unbelievable
You don't know where I've been, Lou
Oh, my God
You don't know where I've been
Please, Lou
Fucking use the basement
Christ
I want your word, Lou
I want your word
Thanks, Lou
We'll see you next week
This week, each one of you has a homework assignment
You're gonna go out
You're gonna start a fight with a total stranger
Excellent choice, sir
Hey
Watch out, jackass
<i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>  Son of a bitch
<i>Most people, normal people, do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>  Excuse me
You sprayed me with your hose
That's not necessary...  Jay
Put the hose down
Stop it
Stop it
Sorry
We need to talk
With your constant absenteeism
With your unpresentable appearance
You're up for review
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise
Let's pretend
You're the Department of Transportation, OK
Someone informs you that this company  installs frontseat mounting brackets that failed collision tests,  brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,  and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive
What then
Are you threatening me
No...  Get the fuck out of here
I have a better solution
In exchange for my salary,  my job will be never to tell people these things that I know
I don't even have to come into the office
I can do this job from home
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are, you crazy little shit
I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>  What the hell are you doing
That hurt
Why would you do that
Oh, my God
No
Please stop
Oh, God, no
Please
No
<i>For some reason, I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>  No
Give me the paychecks, like I asked, and you won't ever see me again
<i>Then, at our most excellent moment together...</i>  Thank God
<i>Telephone, computer,</i>  <i>fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>  <i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>  <i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.</i>  <i>Now, the center of Fight Club became the two men fighting.</i>  <i>The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness.</i>  <i>Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel</i>  <i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>  <i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>  Thank you, sir
<i>Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.</i>  <i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>   There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City
Yeah, I heard
There's one in Penns Grove too
Bob even found one up in New Castle
Did you start that one
No
Stop for a second
Turn around
What are we doing
Homework assignment
What kind
Human sacrifice
Is that a gun
It's a gun
What are you doing
Meet me in the back
Don't fuck around
<i>On a long enough time line,</i>  <i>the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>  What are you doing
Come on
Hands behind your back
Give me your wallet
Raymond K Hessel
Small, cramped basement apartment
How did you know
They give shitty apartments letters
You're going to die
No
Is that your mom and dad
Pick up your dental records
Know why
There'll be nothing left of your face
Oh, come on
An expired community college student ID
S... S... Stuff
Stuff
I asked you what you studied
Biology, mostly
Why
I don't know
The question, Raymond, was what did you want to be
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus
Veterinarian
Veterinarian
Animals
Animals and stuff
Stuff
Yeah, I got that
So you need more schooling
Too much school
Would you rather be dead
No, please...  You'd rather die here, on your knees, in the back of a convenience store
Gonna check in on you
I know where you live
If you're not working to be a veterinarian in six weeks,  you will be dead
Now run on home
Run, Forrest, run
I feel ill
Imagine how he feels
What the fuck was the point of that?
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K Hessel's life
<i>You had to give it to him.</i>  <i> Come on
He had a plan.</i>  <i>And it started to make sense in a Tylersort of way.</i>  <i>No fear
No distractions.</i>  <i>The ability to let that which does not matter</i>  <i>truly slide.</i>  <i>You are not your job.</i>  You're not how much money you have in the bank
You're not the car you drive
You're not your fucking khakis
You are the allsinging, alldancing crap of the world
I'll be out of your way in a sec
You don't have to go
No, I mean..
It's OK.  Are you still going to groups
Yeah
Chloe's dead
Wow, Chloe
When did that happen
Do you care
Yeah, well..
It was the smart move on her part
Listen...  What are you getting out of all this
What
I mean, all this
Why do you keep...  Is this making you happy
Yeah, well, sometimes
I don't understand
Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person
What is... What is that
What do you get out of it
No... That's not the same thing at all
Us
I'm sorry
Do you hear this
Hear what
All that noise
Hold on
No, wait
Don't change the subject
You're not talking about me, are you
No
Playing doctor
What was going on there
What are you talking about
Nothing
I don't think so
What do you want
Look at me
No
What is that?
It's nothing
My God
Who did this
A person
Guy or girl
What do you care
What do you care if I ask
Leave me alone
I am not
Let me go
No
Talk to me
This conversation  This conversation   is over
is over
Hey, this is getting a little old
What is... What is all this
What do you think
Hey, why do we need bunk beds
Hey
Too young
Sorry
If the applicant is young, tell him he's too young
Old, too old
Applicant
If the applicant waits three days without food or shelter,  he may enter and begin training
Training for what
You think this is a game
You're too young to train here, end of story
Get the fuck out of here
Bad news, friend
It's not gonna happen
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding
It's not the end of the world
Go
You're trespassing and I will have to call the police
Don't you look at me
You're never getting in this fucking house
Now get the fuck off my porch
Get off my porch
<i>Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>  I'm gonna go inside and I'm gonna get a shovel
Yes, sir
Two pair of black pants
Yes, sir
One pair black boots
Black socks
One blackjacket
Yes, sir
Yes, sir
All right
Your tits are too big
Get the fuck off my porch
Bob
Bob
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space
Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good
You are too fucking old, fatty
And you... You're too fucking  blond
Get out of here, the both of you
<i>And so it went.</i>  Listen up, maggots
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake
You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else
<i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>  <i>We are the allsinging, alldancing crap of the world.</i>  <i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>  <i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>  <i>To what purpose?</i>  <i>For what greater good?</i>  <i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>  When he was like, "You are not yourjob",  I was like, "Yeah!
Hey, what's all this
OK
What's going on
We're celebrating
What are we celebrating
Go on
Hey
<i>Investigators are here
The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>  <i>Could you tell us what you think has happened here?</i>  <i>We believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism in the city</i>  <i>somehow related to underground boxing clubs.</i>  <i>We will be coordinating a rigorous investigation.</i>  <i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs who just arrived on the scene</i>  <i> of a fouralarm fire that broke out...  She's hot.</i>  <i>Back to you in the studio.</i>   Yeah
Yeah
Holy shit
Yeah
What the fuck did you guys do
<i>Arson investigators are on the premises...</i>  Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir
It will take dedication and commitment and, most of all, cooperation
Streets are safer now
There is hope in the inner city
However..
These are the first steps in a long journey
That is why we have created Project Hope
Bob
Project Hope will be ajoint effort  between the police and community leaders
It will be a powerful new weapon in the war against crime
His balls are ice cold
Hi
You will publicly state there is no underground group or  these guys are gonna take your balls
<i>They'll send one to the New York Times and one to the LA Times.</i>  Look
The people you are after are the people you depend on
We cook your meals
We connect your calls
We drive your ambulances
We guard you while you sleep
Do not fuck with us
Ball check
Let's go
Yeah
<i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i>  <i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>  <i>I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers</i>  <i>and smother those French beaches I'd never see.</i>  <i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>  Where did you go, psycho boy
I felt like destroying something beautiful
Get him to a fucking hospital
Don't worry, Mr Durden
Airport parking
Long term
After you, Mr Durden
Something on your mind, dear
No
Yeah, why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem
First rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions
Fight Club was the beginning
Now it's left the basements and it's Project Mayhem
We started Fight Club together
Remember
It's as much mine as it is yours
Yeah
Weren't we doing this together
This does not belong to us
We are not special
Fuck that
You should have told me
Hey, Tyler
What do you want?
A statement of purpose
Should I email you
Oh...  You decide your level of involvement
I wanna know certain things first
The first rule of Project Mayhem..
Shut up
I wanna know what you're thinking
Forget about what you think you know about life, friendship,  and especially about you and me
What is that supposed to mean
What do you wish you'd done before you died
Paint a selfportrait
Build a house
I don't know
Nothing
Get in the right lane
You have to know
If you died now, how would you feel about your life
I don't know
Nothing good
Come on
Stop fucking around
Tyler
Jesus Christ
Goddamn it
Goddamn it
Fuck Fight Club
Fuck Marla
I am sick of all your shit
Quit screwing around
Steer
Look at you
Steer
You're fucking pathetic
Why
Why
What are you talking about
Why do you think I blew up your condo
What
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat
Stop trying to control everything and just let go
All right
Fine
Fine
<i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>  <i>This must have been what all those people felt like</i>  <i>before I filed them as statistics in my reports.</i>  Goddamn
In the world I see,  you're stalking elk through the Grand Canyon forests  around the ruins of Rockefeller Center
You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower
And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,  laying strips of venison in the empty carpool lane  of some abandoned superhighway
Feel better, champ
<i>And then...</i>  Tyler
You know how much ether is here
<i>Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.</i>  Hang on a second
It's under control, sir
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not..
Right... OK.  <i>I'm all alone.</i>  <i>My father dumped me
Tyler dumped me.</i>  <i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>  <i>What comes next in Project Mayhem only Tyler knows.</i>  <i>The second rule is you do not ask questions.</i>  Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away
The Paper Street Soap Company
Can I come in
He's not here
What
Tyler isn't here
Tyler went away
Two gunshot wounds coming through
Make some fucking room
What happened
What happened
We were on assignment
We were supposed to kill two birds with one stone
Destroy a piece of corporate art...  Operation Latte Thunder
..and trash a franchise coffee bar
We had it all worked out, sir
It went smooth until...  Police
Freeze
They shot Bob
They shot him in the head
Fucking pigs
Those motherfuckers
You morons
You're running around in ski masks trying to blow things up
What did you think was gonna happen?
Get rid of the evidence
We gotta get rid of this body
Bury him
What
Take him to the garden and bury him
Come on, people, let's go
Get away from him
What are you talking about
This is a person
He's my friend and you're not burying him in the garden
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir
This is Bob
Sir, in..
In Project Mayhem, we have no names
This is a man and he has a name, and it's Robert Paulsen, OK
He's a man  and he's dead now because of us
Do you understand that
I understand
In death, a member of Project Mayhem  has a name
His name... is Robert Paulsen
His name is Robert Paulsen
Come on, guys
Stop it
His name is Robert Paulsen
Shut up
This is all over with
Get the fuck out of here
No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit
I need to see you...  <i>I went to all the cities on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.</i>  <i>I didn't know how or why, but I could look at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>  <i>I'm looking for Tyler Durden
It's very important that I talk to him.</i>  I wish I could help you,  sir
<i>Every city I went to,</i>  <i>as soon as I set foot off the plane</i>  <i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>  Hey
Hey
Taxi
I'm a member
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler
You're a moron
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
<i>Tyler had been busy... setting up franchises all over the country.</i>  <i>Was I asleep
Had I slept?</i>  <i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>   We've just heard the stories
What kind of stories
He has plastic surgery every three years
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard
Is Mr Durden building an army
<i>I was living in a state of perpetual dèŒ…jè„¿ vu.</i>  <i>Everywhere I went,</i>  <i>I felt I'd already been there.</i>  <i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>  <i>The smell of dried blood,</i>  <i>dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>  <i>That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.</i>  <i>The feel of a floor still warm from a fight the night before.</i>  <i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>  His name is Robert Paulsen..
Welcome back, sir
How have you been
Do you know me
Is this a test, sir
No
You were in here last Thursday
Thursday
You were standing where you are now, asking how good security is
It's tight as a drum, sir
Who do you think I am
No, this is not a test
You're Mr Durden
You're the one who gave me this
Marla, it's me.</i>  <i> Have we ever done it
Done what?</i>  Had sex
What kind of stupid question is that
Stupid because it's yes or because it's no
<i> Is this a trick
I need to know...</i>  You wanna know if I think we were just having sex or making love
<i> We did make love
Did we do it or not?
You fuck me, then snub me
You're sensitive, then you turn into an asshole
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler
<i>We just lost cabin pressure.</i>  What did you just say
What is wrong with you
Say my name
Tyler Durden
You fucking freak
What's going on
I'm not there
Jesus, Tyler
You fucking talked to her about me
What the fuck is going on
I asked you for one thing
One simple thing
Why do people think that I'm you
Answer me
Answer me
Why do people think I'm you
I think you know
No, I don't
I..
I don't know
You got it
No
Do not fuck with us
Because...  Say it
Because we're the same person
That's right
<i>We are the allsinging, alldancing crap.</i>   I don't understand this
You could not do this on your own
All the ways you wish you could be,  that's me
I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,  I'm free in all the ways that you are not
Oh, no
Tyler's not here
Tyler went away
This isn't possible
This is crazy
People do it every day
They see themselves as they'd like to be
They don't have the courage you have to just run with it
We should do this again sometime
At times, you imagine you're watching me
If this is your first time, you have to fight
Little by little, you're just letting yourself become  Tyler Durden
You are not yourjob or how much money you have
You have a house
Rented in your name
You have jobs, a life
You work nights because you can't sleep
Or you stay up and make soap
You're fucking Marla, Tyler
Oh, my God
Now you see our dilemma
She knows too much
I think we're gonna have to talk about how this might compromise our goals
What... What are you saying
This is bullshit
You are insane
No
You're insane
<i>It's called a changeover.</i>  <i>The movie goes on</i>  <i>and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>   Sir
Are you checking out
Yeah
Bill me
When were these made
Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning
<i>Have I been going to bed earlier every night
Have I been sleeping later?</i>  <i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>  Is anybody here
<i>DèŒ…jè„¿ vu all over again.</i>  With enough soap, one could blow up anything
<i> 1888.  Who am I calling?</i>  <i>1888 Franklin
This is maintenance
Hello?</i>  <i>Hello?</i>  1888 Franklin Street
<i>Yes
Yeah, yeah.</i>  I need to talk to your supervisor right away
<i> Speaking
OK, listen to me.</i>  Something terrible is about to happen to your building
Don't worry about us, sir
We're solid.</i>  <i>2160.</i>  Marla
Marla
Hey, wait
Wait
Marla
Marla
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom
They almost broke my arm
They were burning their fingertips with lye
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say
You have every right to be..
I'll just have a coffee, thanks
Sir
Anything you order is free of charge, sir
Why is it free of charge
Don't ask
Whatever
Clean food, please
In that case, may I advise against the clam chowder
No clam chowder
You got about 30 seconds
I know I've been acting very strange, OK
I know it seems there's two sides to me...  Two sides
You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass
I know
What
The nature of our relationship wasn't clear  to me for reasons I won't go into
I know I haven't treated you well
Whatever
Fifteen seconds, please
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry
What I've come to realize is that I really like you, Marla
You do
I really do
I care about you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you because of me
What
You need to leave town for a while
Get out of any major city
Just go camping...  You're an insane person
I've involved you in something terrible
No
Shut up
You're not safe
Shut up
Listen, I tried, Tyler
I know you did
There are things about you I like
You're smart, funny
You're spectacular in bed
You have very serious emotional problems
Deepseated problems for which you should seek professional help
I know, and I'm sorry
You're sorry, I'm sorry
I can't
And I won't
I'm gone
You can't leave, Marla
You're not safe
Marla, you don't understand
Leave me alone
Let go
I don't ever wanna see you again
That's fine..
Here, wait right here
Shut up
Take this money and get on this bus
I promise I won't bother you again
Please get on the bus
Please get on the bus
They think you're a threat
I can't explain it now, just trust me
If I know where you are, you won't be safe
I'll keep this, it's asshole tax
Fine
Remember, stay out of major cities
You're the worst thing that ever happened to me
Hello
I need you to arrest me
I am the leader of a terrorist organization  responsible for numerous acts of vandalism and assault all over this city
In the metropolitan area, we had probably 200 members
This is a tightlyregimented organization  with many cells capable of operating independent of central leadership
Go to the house, OK
That's our headquarters
In the back, buried in the garden,  you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen
In the basement, you're gonna find some bathtubs  that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin
I believe the plan is to blow up  the headquarters of these credit card companies  and the TRW building
Why these buildings
Why credit card companies
If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero
Keep him talking
I need to make a phone call
I really admire what you're doing
What
You're a genius, sir
You said if anyone ever interferes with Project Mayhem, even you,  we gotta get his balls
Don't fight
It will set an example
You're making a big mistake
You said you'd say that
I'm not Tyler Durden
You told us you'd say that too
I am Tyler Durden
Listen to me
I'm giving you a direct order
We're aborting this mission now
Are you fucking out of your minds
Is somebody timing this
Keep your mouth shut
Shit
Some of this information checks out
Be right there
Hey, wait
I got him
Stop fighting
Where's the rubber band
Get away from me
Drop that fucking knife
Back up
Get down on the floor
The first person that comes out of this door  gets a lead salad
Understand
Get away
<i>I ran.</i>  <i>I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>  <i>Then I ran some more.</i>  What the fuck are you doing
Running around in your underpants
You look crazy
No
I'm onto you
I know what's going on here
I got us a great place to watch from
It'll be like payperview
Oh, Christ
Now what are you doing
Why
I can't let this happen
There are 10 other bombs in 10 other buildings
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder
The buildings are empty
We're not killing anyone
We're setting 'em free
Bob is dead
They shot him in the head
I'm not listening to you
You're not even there
I wouldn't do that
Not unless you knew which wires were what
<i>Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent all day thinking about the wrong ones.</i>  You think
Oh, heavens, no
Not the green one
Pull any one but the green one
I asked you not to do that
Fuck
Tyler, get away from the van
Tyler, I'm not kidding
OK.  You are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend  near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin
Cool it, Tyler
Come on
Don't go
What?
Three minutes
This is it
Ground zero
<i>I think this is about where we came in.</i>  Do you have a speech for the occasion
I'm sorry
I still can't think of anything
Flashback humor
Two and a half
Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history
One step closer to economic equilibrium
Why is she here
Tying up loose ends
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck
I beg you, please don't do this
I'm not doing this
This is what we want
No.</i>   I don't want this
Right
We have to forget about you
You're a voice in my head
You're a voice in mine
You need me
No
I don't
You created me
I didn't create some loser alter ego to make me feel better
Take some responsibility
I do
So, please, I'm begging you, please call this off
Have I ever let us down
How far have you come because of me?
I will bring us through this
As always, I will carry you kicking and screaming  and in the end you will thank me
Tyler
I'm grateful to you
For everything that you've done for me
But this is too much
I don't want this
Your shitjob back
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms
I won't do it
This can't be happening
It's already done, so shut up
60 seconds till CRI
I can figure this out
This isn't even real
You're not real, that gun... That gun isn't even in your hand
Good for you
It doesn't change a thing
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head
Not my head, Tyler
Our head
Interesting
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy
Hey
Friends
OK.  My eyes are open
What's that smell
Where is everybody
Oh, no
What's going on
Mr Durden
Are you... Are you all right, sir
Oh, yeah, I'm OK.  You look terrible, sir
What happened
No, no, no, sir
He's not kidding
You need assistance
I'm fine
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine
Stop it
Let her go
Christ Almighty
You
Leave her with me
Meet me downstairs
Are you sure
Yes, I'm sure
What kind of sick fucking game are you playing at?
Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face
What happened
Don't ask
You're shot
Yes, I'm shot
Oh, my God
One tough motherfucker
Who did this
I did, actually
Find some gauze
Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me
I'm really OK.  Trust me
Everything's gonna be fine
You met me at a very strange time in my life
I always think of her head
I picture cracking her lovely skull...  Unspooling her brains..
Trying to get answers
The primal questions of any marriage
"What are you thinking?
"How are you feeling?
The Irish prince graces us with his presence
His majesty prefers not to be moistened
I got you a present
You loved it
Thank you
I'll add it to the collection
Can you pour me a bourbon
What's up, jitters
Well, if you're not going to talk, I'm gonna have to fill the silence...  With another excruciating story by margo dunne
I like that one
Or how about the time I saw that woman who looked exactly like my friend Monica
But it wasn't Monica
It was a total stranger
Who was also named Monica
Made it kind of interesting
I'm just having a bad day
Amy
Five years
Five
That came fast
And furious
I'm so crazy, stupid happy
I met a boy
A great, sweet, gorgeous, coolass guy
I just want you to be careful...  Where you put down that monkbrewed Belgian wheat beer...  Because the party's down to three beast lights and a bottle of pucker
It might attract some desperate characters
I mean, the amish are on a rumspringa
They already relieved me of my artisanal meat platter
Finally, someone tells me how to pronounce that word
"Meat"
Yes, "meat.
One syllable
Whose beer am I about to drink
Let's see, who's your type
I don't see you sitting quietly..
While he bloviates on his postgrad thesis about proust
Uhoh
Is that him
Ironic hipster, so selfaware, he makes everything a joke
What type are you
Cornfed, saltoftheearth Missouri guy
Missouri
Cute
Native new yorker
What's your name
Amy
Well, Amy, who are you
A, I'm an awardwinning scrimshander
C, I write personality quizzes for magazines
Okay
So I'd recognize you
I'm gonna go with "c."  And you
Who are you
So, you write for a men's magazine
God, does that make you an expert on being a man
No
It's what to wear, what to drink
How to bullshit
Never with you
Ha, ha
It's hard to believe you
Why
I think it's your chin
Yeah, it's quite villainous
A hundred percent true, no bullshit
Okay
We all move to New York...  And we end up living in these little cubby holes, and that's not it
Come outside
Then, you're in it
You have to see this
Hey
I have to kiss you now
I can't let you go through a sugar storm unkissed
Wait a second
There you go
Nick dunne..
I really like you
So, is Amy gonna do one of those anniversary...  Treasure hunts
You mean the forced march designed to prove...  What an oblivious and uncaring asshole her husband is
Life
I don't remember the point
Spin
What was the clue last year she got so mad about
"When your poor Amy has a cold...  "This dessert just must be sold.
The answer
I still don't know the answer, go
A few years ago, you'd have known
A few years ago, it was fun
She got me a beautiful notebook
Told me to go write my novel
What did you get her
A kite
Okay
Anyway
She led me outside to the dying rosebush in the backyard
That's symbolic
Yeah
Wood
So, what did you get her
There's no good gift for wood
I know
Go home, fuck her brains out, slap her with your penis
The bar
Why, yes
Hang on one second
Hey, it's watchful Wally
Hey, Walt
What's going on
I'll be right there
Hey, buddy
What are you doing out here
Thanks, Walt
Amy
Hello
Come on in
Hey
Mister dunne
Hi
I'm detective Rhonda boney
This is officer James gilpin
I don't know where my wife is
And I came home to this
Now, I don't panic easily..
But it's weird, right
How long have you two been here
Two years in September
We used to live in New York
City
Yeah, I was a writer
Why did you all move back here
My mom got sick
Oh, I'm sorry
How is she
She's dead
What do you do now, for work
My sister margo and I own the bar downtown
Love the name
Very meta
Thanks
Pretty things
Stay
My office, here
Beautiful dress
It's our anniversary
It's a guest bedroom, there
Cat's room on the end
I checked up here
This is my wife's office
Amy's office
Impressive gal
Yeah
Should I be concerned
I remember these
I loved these books
Wait a minute
Yeah
She is
Wow
AmazingfuckingAmy is getting fucking married
With me, regular, flawed, real Amy, jealous, as always, of the golden child
Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy, who's getting fucking married
In the next book, amazing Amy became a prodigy
Did you play volleyball
I got cut, freshman year
When did you have a dog
She got the dog
Puddles made her more relatable
Wow
I love your parents..
But they really can be assholes
Nick
Hey, thanks for coming, man
No problem
Hey, sweetheart
Big night for your mom
People wanna hear from you
We can't stay long
Fifteen minutes, tops
This is why I have my brownstone
My trust fund
I know I can't complain
Your parents literally plagiarized your childhood
No, they improved upon it, and then peddled it to the masses
I thought you were gonna wear white to match the wedding theme
"If it's worth doing, it's worth doing..."  hold up
I know how this ends
Don't tell me
Amy, you know what would make dad's night
I'm on it
I love having strangers pick at my scabs
I'm curious whether..
It's difficult for you to see amazing Amy heading down the aisle
Is that correct
Correct
Amazing Amy has always been one step ahead of me
Excuse me
I'm sorry, I just have a few questions
It's you
I'm here in a strictly journalistic capacity
Two magical years
Two magical years
In the course of that time, you've had the opportunity...  To perform such gracious gestures as...  Not correcting Nick when he pronounced "quinoa" as "kweenoa.
He also thought it was a fish
He thinks velveeta is a cheese
You also manage to appear shocked and delighted..
that's just frightening
You also bought Nick his very first pair of scissors
And matching stapler
Amy elliott, you are more than amazing
You challenge me
You surprise me
And, fun fact for the readers...  You have a worldclass vagina
My colleagues tell me that you are not yet married
Is that correct
I'm not
And then..
The night wasn't so bad anymore
And it's done
Crossed off the list
Now, normally, we would not treat this as a missing persons case so quick..
Good
We've got forensics over at your place
You got somewhere to stay
I could stay at my sister's
We're tracking Amy's phone, her credit cards
We will organize searches, put up flyers
We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow
You're having a press conference
I wanna get the word out, right
Time is of the essence in these cases
But, that said, do you wanna wait and call a lawyer
Absolutely not
So, you and Amy have been here two years
You tend bar..
I own the bar
And I teach creative writing at mvcc
No kids
Not yet
A woman with all those degrees, what does she do
I don't know
She keeps busy
She's a voracious reader
So, she's always got a book in her hand
Well, days can get long
Or prescription pills
Just last week, we had a soccer mom
Nice lady
Got her teeth kicked in over some oxycontin
Ever since that mall went bust, half the town is out of work
We cannot keep up with the drug violence
I'm pretty sure that's not it
No, not really
No friends
This whole town
She was very close with my mom, before she passed away
In our neighborhood
I think maybe you guys should check that out
We'll look into that
Where were you before that
Just to cross that out
Well, I was home
I left at 9:30, I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper
Did you visit with anyone there
I kind of go to Sawyer beach for the solitude
So, your wife has no friends here
Is she kinda standoffish
Rubs people the wrong way
She's from New York
She's got very high standards
Type a
That can make you crazy if you're not like that
You seem pretty laidback
Type b
God, I don't know
I'd have to look it up at the house
You don't know if she has friends, you don't know what she does all day...  And you don't know your wife's blood type
Sure you all are married
Maybe it's type o
Where are her folks
Yeah
Can they get here time for this press conference tomorrow
Tomorrow
I have no idea
I haven't talked to them
You can't get a signal in this building
Call them, please, Nick
Now
Fine
No
I apologize, marybeth
I didn't know what was going on
Now I'm at the station...  And the cops are at the house, and it's serious and I'm calling you
There's a lot of things that are being juggled right now
I'm standing right next to detective Rhonda boney...  Who's the lead investigator on this and she's...  My motherinlaw would like to speak with you
I wanna go home
I don't know why I have to be here
I don't wanna be here
I wanna go home
Dad
What's going on
Really
You're Nick dunne
We've been trying to get a hold of you all afternoon
My wife is missing
Bitch
Your father wandered out of comfort hill after lunch
We found him walking route 79, disoriented
We've been trying to call you for the last..
I don't get a cell signal in this building
I've been sitting 20 feet away from you
Sir, please don't take that tone with me
Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch
You wanna drive him home
Thanks
This voice mailbox is currently full
Fuck
Get your fucking hands off me
Thanks
Marriage is hard work
And compromise and more work
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter.
"When young Amy's hope did wane...  "She wandered here..."  Well, it's not true
"...In search of Jane.
With us, two years..
It's just good
You were an alienated teen and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you
Look at that
My God
You naughty minx
Well, technically, we are supposed to fuck at the next stop
Yeah, in keeping with tradition
But I might be willing to bend the rules this once
I'm enthusiastic
Look at that
It's confirmed by the..
Year two
Cotton
We had that joke that our sex was too good for ordinary
I wanna punch us in the face
That's pretty great
I mean, that is pretty great
Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer
I don't need a lawyer
Well, did they ask personal stuff about Amy
You know, they asked...  Why didn't she have any friends
I said she was complicated
Nick
Everyone knows "complicated" is code for "bitch.
God
Thanks
It's so bizarre
It seems like the kind of thing that would happen to Amy
She always attracts...  drama
It's just me and you
Just because I don't like to be around Amy..
Doesn't mean I don't care about her
Anyway, whoever took her is bound to bring her back
Detective
Excuse me
I'm Amy's best friend
Well, great
Where do you live, noelle
1032
Wonderful
Can I come by in half an hour
Y'all know anything yet
I'm sorry
I got guys on the clock in here
But that's usually bath time
Well, we'll talk in between shampoos
All right
So, what do you got
Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep
Not that weird, but that is awfully high
So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep
Well, okay

House is rented in her name
Car's in her name
Credit cards, utilities, phone bill, all in her name
Even his bar's in her name
I don't know that that's so surprising
No
What you got
It's with her unmentionables
Well, we have our first clue
I have to take a shower
No, don't
You wanna look like you've been up all night
That's a weird thing to say
Well, when you're upset, you bottle up
You can seem angry, like...  please don't say, "like dad.
Or else you swing into your momma'sboy charm offensive and that can feel glib
Perfect
I'll balance on the exact fucking edge of your emotional razor

Hi, rand
Hey, man
I'm detective boney
Margo
We played tennis yesterday, Nick
I just can't get over it
Marybeth, I am really sorry
I knew you never should have moved back here
We didn't have a lot of choice
But we are all here now
And we will find Amy, together
Should I just go first, and then you guys can say something
Good
Disappeared from our home on the morning of July 5th..
Under suspicious circumstances
Louder
If anyone out there has any information..
Thank you
I'm rand elliott
My wife, marybeth elliott
Should I have said my name
Amy is our only child
She's bright, she's beautiful
She's kind
She really is amazing Amy
And we just want her back
Amy is a decorated scholar
She forged a successful career in journalism
She returned here to her husband's hometown...  And she made a life in her adopted home
We're establishing a volunteer headquarters at the drury lodge
We have a hotline, 18554Amytips
And our website is www.Findamazingamy.Com
Mr. dunne
Mr. elliott
Mr. dunne, any signs of foul play
Smile
That's all for now
Amy is the kind of girl who attracts admirers
Right, Nick
Yeah, definitely
And we've had instances...   Where things got..
Scary
Yeah, I know all about desi collings
He was obsessed
He attempted suicide after Amy broke up with him sophomore year
We had to file a restraining order
This would be high school
But he recently moved to St. Louis
That's just two hours away
To be fair, he is from St. Louis
We also have Tommy O'Hara
This is only eight years ago, in New York
She broke up with him, he got very physical
What was the charge
Sexual assault, threat, battery, what
I didn't know this
Okay
Thank you
Anything more recent
Not that I know of
Hey, Nick
Yeah
A missing persons case...  And in your wife's dressing room, we find an envelope marked "clue.
That's for our anniversary
My wife does these treasure hunts
I'm hoping you can tell me what this means
You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt
It'll help me track Amy's movements before she disappeared
Of course
"Although this spot couldn't be tighter...  "It's a cozy room for my favorite writer.
I know this one
Although this spot couldn't be any tighter..
It's a cozy room for my favorite writer
Well, well
What does it say
Clue two
"Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover
"You'll be the spy, and I'll be his lover
"Let's head on over...  "To the little brown house
These yours
No
But you read the first clue
Randy Professor, naughty student
Me and my ex just swapped cards
Where's this little brown house
I have no idea
Hello
Nicholas dunne
Under my father's name, William dunne
Is this necessary
Can you just turn the bell...  yeah, I know
It's "puddles," right
Or is it "poodles?
We're good
Hello, stranger
Fancy meeting you here
It's your dad's house, right
Like you said, it's my dad's house
I come by once a week, make sure the place hasn't burned down
But it looks okay
I'll walk you out
You know..
I thought maybe this was the little brown house
Nope
Still blue
Picture me, I'm a girl who's very, very bad
I need to be punished, and by "punished," I mean "had.
It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five
Bitch
Want to test your marriage for weak spots
Add one recession...  Subtract two jobs
It's surprisingly effective
Promise me we'll never be like them
Those wives who treat their men like dancing monkeys...  To be trained and paraded
Husbands who treat their wives like the highway patrol...  To be outfoxed and avoided
I think I'm gonna be laid off
We're in a recession
If it happens, we'll deal with it
I'll probably be next
We have each other
You are exceptional
My parents' publisher dropped them, and they're in debt up to their ears
That's terrible
And they need to borrow from my trust fund
How much
Almost a million
That's almost all of it
This is where you say, "everything else is background noise.
I said I'd do it
Without talking to me
Well, it's..
Your call
You know what
You're right
Everything else is just background noise
Hey
Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks
What's the laptop for
I see
You can give your parents $879,000 without talking to me..
But God forbid I buy a video game without getting your permission
You are spending a lot
You don't trust me
You don't trust my judgment
You certainly don't trust my intention
That's the basic tenet of a prenup, isn't it
Because it's easy to throw
Nick, I don't get it
I don't get why you're daring me to be someone I don't wanna be
The nagging shrew
The controlling bitch
I'm your wife
I'm sorry
I just don't know how to do this
I flipped burgers, I painted houses
You'll get another job
Hi, go
What
What
And suddenly..
Slow down, what is it
I knew everything was about to get worse
Okay, tell me what's wrong
Bless you, Nick
Hey, tom
Mayor
Nick, good to see you
Good to see you
Hey, guys, hey
Nick
Oh, we'll find her
Thank you
You ever see that guy in the glasses before
We videotape everybody that comes in and out of these things
I mean, you tend to get a lot of...  Dogooders
Freaks
Hey, I meant to ask you
Noelle hawthorne
She lives on your street
Amy's best friend
She and her husband have triplets
Oh
But "best friend"
No
Excuse me, one sec
Of course he did
Look, these two are yours
Oh, look
He's being a good guy..
So everybody can see him being a good guy
You really don't like him, do you
This mailbox is currently full
Press one to...  Nick
My name's shawna Kelly
I am so sorry for your troubles
Thank you
That's kind
Are you remembering to eat
Well, a lot of cold cuts
That's very kind and very unnecessary
You have to keep your strength
Would you...  Say, "chicken frito pie!
You know what
Would you delete that picture for me
I know it is
But just do me a favor
Will you
Would you go ahead and please delete that picture
You just press...  What is wrong with you
I will share it with whomever I please
Dude
Yeah
Why
Marybeth
It was important to my mother that I be polite..
I be considerate, I be a gentleman
It looked like you were having fun
I am in a nightmare
All I'm trying to do is be nice...  To the people who are volunteering to help find Amy
And I'm sorry
My God, this place literally smells like feces
In your searches, did you find any golf clubs, real fancy
No
How about a brand new stratocaster
Well, all right
How big's that TV
No, it's nowhere near that
Okay
Kibble
He asked me to feed his cat
I saw some in the pantry
Detective boney, officer gilpin
Noelle hawthorne
I know y'all are in there
Detective boney
Just remind her it is a possible crime scene
Look at that pieeating grin, from a guy whose wife is missing
Terrific
How's marybeth
She's a wreck
And you
Awesome
Hey...  Have you told me everything
Of course
Everything
I am off
Everybody's examining me and projecting their shit on me
All I want is to come over here, have a beer with you...  And not be judged
Can we do that
Of course
You know what I keep thinking
If mom were here
Like I'm 12
Nick, mom would fix it
Love you
Love you
So, here's a strange, new sentence
I am a missourian
Bye, dad
No money, no jobs, no prospects
Mama Maureen..
So, we moved to Missouri
I don't mind
I just wish he'd asked
Nick is happy to be home
But I don't know if he's happy I'm with him
I feel like something he loaded by mistake
Something disposable
I feel like I could disappear
Oh, my God
I saw you on TV
Okay
It's so crazy
She just vanished
She's just gone
I've been so worried about you
Where have you been
You gotta pick up your phone
What
Godspell
My sister's asleep in the other room
I needed to see you
Can you at least tell me you love me
I do love you, but we have to be really careful right now
I've been so scared
Between rehearsals
You told me I needed to have my own life
I know
I need you
Touch me
Come here
Sit down
Okay
Did you, by any chance, tell anybody anything about us
Even in texting, or on Facebook
Facebook
You buy my presents in cash
I'm not stupid, Nick
I know, sweetie
Did you leave a pair of red panties in my office
I don't know
They better be mine
Sweetheart, think
I don't know
Andie, I need you to take this seriously, okay
This is the last time we're gonna see each other, until...  Until when
Until it's safe
You were going to get a divorce
Okay
I'm sorry
I don't wanna fight
Andie, please...  That's all I want
I can't
It's our last time together
Let's make the most of it
Real quick, but then you have to go
My husband has come undone
But as it turns out, we couldn't
It means a lot that you came
We took a hit on the brownstone...  And I used the last of my trust fund to buy him a bar
Nick uses me for sex when he wants
We should go to outback tonight
That would be nice
Last night, I went from desperate to pathetic
I became someone I don't even like
The kind of woman I used to mock
You're out so much
I know
Stay home
Then, can I come
You would hate it
It's a bunch of my dorky high school friends
No bullshit
I thought we weren't gonna be that couple
Hey, I've been thinking
Yeah
Something positive
Maybe it's time
Now is literally the worst time
And for me, I would have a real purpose here
A child is not a hobby
Not a hobby
An inspiration
I'm late
I didn't know it was gonna be a fight
You really wanna be the couple that has a baby to save their marriage
Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever
And you're gonna walk out the door now
Yeah
You're a fucking coward
Really
I won't
You won't
Why, it's not good enough for you
It's not even close
You stupid bitch
What scared me wasn't that he'd pushed me
What scared me was that I'd finally realized..
I am frightened of my own husband
You want me to call for backup
Nah, I'll protect you
Jesus
They ought to burn this place down
Seems like folks are trying
You really think this is anything
Hey, Jason
What's up, Rhonda
"...and dedicated to the proposition that all men..."   Have you seen this girl around here
She was reported missing
"...and so dedicated, can long endure.
Yeah
I remember her
What did she want
She wanted a gun
I felt bad, though
She seemed really desperate
She said it needed to be small, so she could keep it close
You don't forget a girl like that in here
She was all in pink
It was Valentine's day
For Valentine's day, I thought I'd buy a gun
Nick wants me gone but he won't ask for a divorce
In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar, his only line of credit
The bitch with the prenup
I could go home to my parents..
And I don't even know if I believe the truth
Can I really think Nick would hurt me
I'm being paranoid
Crazy
It's just..
I'd sleep better with a gun
Wake up, baby
My sister's gonna come out here
Sorry to rush you
It's okay
Here
Let me help you
Be very careful
I'm all right
Here you go
Promise me we'll talk every day
Okay, we will
Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy
Don't go crazy
You fucking idiot
You fucking asshole
You fucking lied to my fucking face
I'm sorry
She's in her early 20s
A year and a half
You lied to me for over a year
If I told you, you would have made me stop
It's so fucking small
You're a liar and a cheat
How did you even meet her
She's one of my students
I thought writers hated clichÃ©s
I'm not a writer
"Boohoo, I got laid off
I guess I'll fuck a teenager.
You have no idea how shitty it was with Amy...  How fucking terrible she made me feel
I would get knots in my stomach...  Just coming home, knowing she would be sitting there..
Dissatisfied, before I even walked in the fucking door
This is so bad
If anybody finds out, you're totally fucked
Boney found a pair of panties in my office...  Where, occasionally, Andie and I..
I don't know what the fuck it means
Are they supertwat's
Her name is Andie
So we are dealing with a 20yearold...  Who isn't sure where she leaves her undies
If they're not Andie's, that means that they're Amy's...  And she left them there for me to find
Nick, I was scared for you before, and now, I'm fucking petrified
We're having a vigil tonight for your missing wife...  And this morning, you're kissing your college girlfriend goodbye
Have you watched television lately
Cable news is all over your shit
His wife's nowhere to be found...  And here's Nick dunne for you, flirting
Cute pic, huh
Who is that
Who the fuck is that
I don't know
She was trying to give me a casserole
On the show today we have defense attorney, Tanner bolt...  Patron Saint to wifekillers everywhere
Tanner bolt, would you actually consider defending Nick dunne
Well, let me just say...  As always, Ellen, thank you for such a warm welcome
But of course, I'd defend Nick dunne
But the truth is, you'd have to be a sociopath...  To behave normally in this situation...  Because it's the most abnormal situation in the world
Tanner, are you trying to tell me that this photo...  Is remotely in the realm of acceptable behavior
I'm so sick of being picked apart by women
You need to hire Tanner bolt
Innocent until proven guilty
That's exactly what you deserve
Go home, Nick
Hey, buddy
I can't believe we haven't arrested this guy
We're not gonna arrest anybody...  Just because some blonde dunce says so
Why are you going so easy on him
One, I am conducting an investigation, not a witchhunt
She was trying to buy a gun
We don't know who or what was scaring her, gil
Give me the update
No drug angles panned out yet, so cross that off the list
I talked to the nurses who care for Nick's father
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten, so cross that off the list
Hey
Hey
Whoa
Yeah
The blood is profuse
Thoughts on a weapon
Maybe a club or a twobyfour
She fell there, but I doubt she got back up
Amy's medical records come in
No, we'll have them later tonight
My wife says he's a killer
Well, if Tiffany says...  Hey
Hey
Thank you all for coming out
Rich, thank you so much
Thank you, folks
Thank you for being here tonight
It just means the world to our family
And to Amy
As you all know...  My wife, Amy elliott dunne..
And I want to implore anyone who has any information at all..
Please come forward
Help us
So hot
I wanna say something, because I think some of you might be wondering...  And are too polite to ask
I had nothing to do with the disappearance of my wife
I'm cooperating with the police
I haven't hired a lawyer
I have nothing to hide
Amy is my soul mate
Asshole
I love my wife..
So much
And I may not behave for the cameras the way they want me to...  And if they wanna punish me for that, that's okay
But I just wanna ask you in the media, please, harass me..
But don't harass the people of this town
Nick
But please don't turn this investigation into a circus
Where's your wife, Nick
What did you do to your pregnant wife
Did you tell them that, Nick
Did you tell them Amy was six weeks pregnant
Thank you for your support tonight
Go ahead, if you guys wanna say something
Gil, go, go
Nick, where are you going
No questions right now
Thank you
Why are you running away
Don't run
Everybody, stay back
You know better
Get off the grass, get down to the curb
Hey, gil...  On it
All right, y'all heard her
No pictures
Hello
Hello
Fuck
You scared me
Want a drink
I told you, noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy
She doesn't even know Amy
They look like pretty good friends to me
Look, I don't know
We have her medical records coming
Good
So, let's talk while we wait
Let's start over here
The scene of the crime
Dozens and dozens
This area right here, it looked wrong from the second we saw it
The whole thing looked staged
And yet, they remained upright throughout this lifeanddeath struggle
I don't know
What do you want me to say
Did you do any housekeeping the day your wife went missing
Because our guys did a luminol test
And I'm sorry to tell you, but that kitchen lit up
Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick
Oh, my God
Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up
Wait a second
Why would they mop up the blood..
If they're trying to stage a crime scene
It tells us, look at people outside the house
Like these homeless you keep mentioning
A pool of blood and no body suggests homicide
It tells us to look at people inside the house
I see
So, how was your marriage, Nick
Because right now, all we got is noelle
She says, "not good.
What pisses you off
Me and my ex, it's the same
I mention that because we got a look at your finances, Nick
$117,000 in credit card debt
What
I pulled up some of the merchandise
There are these fun little splurges
I didn't buy any of this stuff
I do
You bought great clubs
I like the robot dog
This is identity theft
This is a felony
All right
Let's talk about life insurance
Because in April, you bumped up Amy's life insurance...  To $1.2 million
That was her idea
She wanted me to
You filed the paperwork
Because she told me to
Yeah
Okay
All right
She was pregnant
This is insane
I don't want to talk to you again, ever..
Without a lawyer
Margo
Hey
Just hold on a second
Nick
I hear you, I hear you
I was as surprised as..
I know you're upset
I had no idea she was pregnant
Listen, I thought so, too, but evidently that wasn't...  you want to know the truth
Well, I'm as surprised as...  you told me you didn't want kids
Then, suddenly, you've got a pregnant wife
That's a problem for you
Especially when you factor in the secret teenage girlfriend
Oh, stop watching Ellen abbott
I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids because she didn't want me to
Because it would have just been another reason for you to hate her
And we had enough of those already
It was easier to just...   lie to me
I wanted kids
When we first moved here, I went to a fertility clinic
It didn't work
I did my part
When it came time for Amy to do her thing, all of a sudden it was like...  "Well, I don't know
Maybe
No, thanks.
Now, who would believe you
This is a letter from the clinic...  Notifying me that they're gonna destroy my sample..
Unless I contact them
So, I gave it to Amy
The next day, I saw it in the trash
I wanted a baby with Amy
"When your poor Amy has a cold, this dessert just..."  this is the clue you couldn't solve
Yeah
A letter from desi
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's
It was the fucking rich guy who would do anything for her
It just kept hanging over my head
Your prenup
Nick, why have you kept this stuff
It's like a little box of hate
I don't know, go
I love you no matter what
But you need to tell me
What are you asking me
Are you asking me if I killed my wife, go
Is that what you're asking me
If I murdered my wife
Margo
Don't walk on the glass
You have no clue, do you
Why was he here that night
His wife is missing
Who cares
Rhonda, we got this
Let's make the arrest
Do you know how hard it is to make a murder case without a body
No
So, I want one last thing
What's that
I want a body
I'm a girl who's very, very bad
Be careful
I need to be punished, and by "punished," I mean "had.
Fuck
It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five
So, open the door...  Punish
Beach
And look alive
Wood
Wood
I will practice believing my husband loves me...  And will love this baby
That this child might really save our marriage
But I could be wrong
The way he looks at me..
This man of mine may kill me
He may truly..
Kill me
Wtf
I am so much happier now that I'm dead
Technically, "missing.
Gone
And my lazy, lying, cheating, oblivious husband...  Will go to prison for my murder
Nick dunne took my pride and my dignity...  And my hope and my money
He took and took from me until I no longer existed
Let the punishment fit the crime
To fake a convincing murder, you have to have discipline
Harvest the details of her humdrum life
And cram her with stories about your husband's violent temper
Secretly create some money troubles
Credit cards, perhaps online gambling
With the help of the unwitting...  Bump up your life insurance
Purchase getaway car
Generic
Cheap
Pay cash
You need to package yourself so that people will truly mourn your loss
And America loves pregnant women
You know what's hard
Faking a pregnancy
First, drain your toilet
Invite pregnant idiot into your home...  And ply her with lemonade
Steal pregnant idiot's urine
A pregnancy is now part of your legal medical record
Happy anniversary
Off he goes
And the clock is ticking
Meticulously stage your crime scene...  With just enough mistakes to raise the specter of doubt
You need to bleed
A lot
A head wound kind of bleed
A crime scene kind of bleed
You need to clean poorly...  Like he would
Clean and bleed
Bleed and clean
And because you're you...  You don't stop there
You need a diary
Minimum, 300 entries on the Nick and Amy story
Start with the fairy tale early days
Those are true
And they're crucial
You want Nick and Amy to be likeable
The spending
The abuse
The fear
The threat of violence
Burn it just the right amount
Make sure the cops will find it
Finally, honor tradition with a very special treasure hunt
And if I get everything right, the world will hate Nick...  For killing his beautiful, pregnant wife
And after all the outrage, when I'm ready..
And when they find my body, they'll know...  Nick dunne dumped his beloved like garbage
And she floated down past all the other..
Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women
Then, Nick will die, too
But, then, we never really existed
Nick loved a girl I was pretending to be
Men always use that as their defining compliment
"She's a cool girl.
Cool girl is hot
Cool girl is fun
Cool girl never gets angry at her man
She only smiles in a chagrined, loving manner...  And then presents her mouth for fucking
So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster who loves fetish manga
If he likes girls gone wild, she's a mall babe...  Who talks football and endures buffalo wings at Hooters
When I met Nick dunne, I knew he wanted cool girl
And for him, I'll admit, I was willing to try
I waxstripped my pussy raw
I drank canned beer watching Adam sandier movies
I blew him semiregularly
I lived in the moment
I was fucking game
I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it
Nick teased out of me things I didn't know existed
A lightness, a humor, an ease
Sharper
I inspired him to rise to my level
I forged the man of my dreams
We were happy pretending to be other people
And what's the point of being together if you're not the happiest
But Nick got lazy
He became someone I did not agree to marry
Then he dragged me, penniless, to the navel of this great country...  And found himself a newer, younger, bouncier..
Cool girl
You think I'd let him destroy me and end up happier than ever
No fucking way
My cute, charming, saltoftheearth, Missouri guy
He needed to learn
Grownups pay
Grownups suffer consequences
Wait
I need 20 seconds where you don't judge me, interrupt me...  Or get angry
Okay
Where do you store goodies for anniversary five
Wood
Woodshed
That fucking bitch
I thought..
It's all right
I would have, too
What's that present
I don't know
"Dear husband, I know you think you're moving through this world unseen
"Don't believe that for a second
"I know where you've been, and I know where you're going.
"For this anniversary, I've arranged a trip
"Follow the river, up, up, up
What's "up, up river"
"Up the river.
Prison
That's what this is
She's framing me for her murder
You married a complete psychopath
The morning of our anniversary..
I just couldn't do it
I couldn't fake it for another year, another day
Then what happened
Before I could say anything, she said...  "I need you to go somewhere and really think about our marriage.
So you'd have no alibi
She stagemanaged me
And I fucking did it
I went to the beach, I thought about our marriage
I came back and decided I wanted a divorce
You fuck
She's good
Part of me was relieved..
When I thought she was gone
Punch and Judy puppets
So I'm punch
We already knew that, Amy, what's your point
Does Missouri have the death penalty
It's been weeks since I had anyone decent next door
Well, I don't know how decent I feel
As long as you don't own a python and blast death metal at 4 am...  We're gonna be best friends
All right
I'm greta
I'm Nancy
Are you going to the marina
I could use some creamer
I'm sorry
I can't
I've got work to do
See you around
You will
Come on
Show me that darling Nicky smile
Hey
Nancy
Nancy
It's hot again today
Let me guess
Nebraska
New Orleans
Oh, I just bet you are
Lotions and balms
Ointment
So sweet
Okay
You know where I'll be
I see we have the same taste in men
Least you could do is not keep his secrets for him
Let me guess
He's trying to watch the big game and you just won't shut up
No, you don't seem like much of a talker
You caught your boy rubbing up on some hot little skank...  And he apologized to you by busting you a good one
Worse
Worse
I went to the bar where he works to surprise him
And out he comes with this girl who had no business being in a bar
On the very first night that we met...  We walked by a bakery that was having their sugar delivered
A sugar storm
And before he kissed me..
He leaned in...  And did this
What
He did the exact same thing with her
Thank you
Thanks very much
Well, we've gone mainstream
It's an appeals process, so we will attempt to appeal to them
Mr. bolt
Tanner bolt
Nick dunne
I have been sitting by the phone, my friend
Do you not believe me
No, I believe you
It's just the craziest thing I've ever heard
But, for you, it sucks
But you gotta have a grudging respect for your wife at this point, right
Are you laughing me out of the building
No
Are you kidding me
I'm way in
You came to the right guy
This is what I do, Nick
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer
$100,000
We'll figure something out
Okay
So, what's the plan
Well, right now, it's a "he said, she said.
No, Nick
She is telling the perfect story
So, we need to start today to prepare your defense, should we need it
And if we decide to go with your version of...  the truth
Then we'll need to realign the public's perception of Amy
Make them stop seeing her as America's sweetheart...  And see her for what she is, which a mindfucker of the first degree
Now, that is a huge realignment
There has to be someone out there that she's screwed with in the past
There's a New York guy
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara
That should be easy to find
She said that he stalked her
He's in St. Louis
You go talk to Tommy, and I'll draw up the contract
I told you, you came to the right guy
Tommy
Yeah
Thanks for seeing me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
So, she said you got physical with her
No, dude, she said I raped her
First degree, felony rape
Did you do it
Did you do it
I was looking at 30 years to life
Did you get a trial
Do I look like I would do well in the yard
I pled down, man
Sexual assault one, no jail time
That's something
I've been unemployed for the last eight years...  Because I have to write "sexual offender" on every job application
I'm on a neighborhood watch list, because I have to register as a predator
I haven't had a date in almost a decade, because if a girl googles me...  Could you walk me through what happened
I meet Amy at this party, you know
She's perfect
I think, "what's the catch?
A few months, it hits me
This is not going to be easy
Girls like a fixerupper, but Amy
She made me her business
It was just too much
She went out and bought me ties
And we must have gone 20 rounds over that
Ties
The whole thing just became...   so, you broke up with her
No, I just backed away
So I thought
Then one night, Amy comes over to my place...  With a bottle of bourbon and a bootleg of this band I love
And within two minutes, she's got my pants around my ankles...  And she is kneeling down, and..
I'm sorry
I know it's your wife
You had sex
Yeah, consensual
Next morning, there's two cops at my door
Ligature marks on her wrist, and my semen
It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed, and raped her
Me
And then, guess what they find
Headboards of my bed, one on each side
The ties you wouldn't wear
You do know your wife
Yeah
On TV, last week, with you
"She's graduated from being raped to being murdered.
You been watching this, too
Last night's bombshell
We just found out...  Amy elliott dunne was, indeed, pregnant when she went missing
Kelly capitono, this makes me wanna throw up
What is it about a pregnant woman, a woman carrying life inside her...  That turns men into animals
The third leading cause of death among pregnant women...  Is homicide committed by a boyfriend or husband
Let's not forget about the wife, ever
Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend, noelle hawthorne
Thanks for being on the show, noelle
Thank you, Ellen
Oh, that's nice
Amy was so nurturing
Oh, I'd love if just once, someone was like...  "She was a real rag.
She was beautiful and smart and kind
Seems like a rich bitch to me
People love her
I don't know
She seems uppity
Spoiled rich girl, married a cheating asshole
The only secret was her husband
We never met Nick
He never introduced himself
Why do you think
I think we know why
Because he had a violent temper
A little harsh
That's life, baby
Don't get me wrong
I'm not saying it's okay he killed her
I'm just saying, there are consequences
Fuck, yeah
And she was so innocent
You're a good friend, noelle
And you're a good friend of the show
Thanks for coming on
Please tell me you landed Tanner bolt
Tanner bolt landed me
And, go...  Tanner's retainer is $100,000
That's just the retainer
Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings
I've got $2,500 in an ira
We will go from there
Thank you
I love you
I love you, too
Nick keeps his father, who has Alzheimer's, in a facility
One
Oh, fuck
His twin sister, margo, well, she is a peach
These two spend their days in the bar Amy bought them
Playing house
Twin siblings often enable and abet
While I never examined Nick, or his sister..
They both seem very, very close
Disturbingly close, Lauren
And so, we close with a question
What kind of moral rot..
Allows a beautiful, talented, kind, smart, loving mother...  To vanish without the heavens hearing our outraged cries
Amy elliott dunne, we care about you, and we will not forget
And you know what else we won't forget
Missouri has the death penalty
Amen
I'd like to report some strange activity...  Near the woodshed on the property of one margo dunne
Hey
Mr. dunne
Mr. collings
I saw you at the volunteer center
I wanted to help
I hope you don't mind me coming by
Amy and I believe in the lost art of letterwriting
I always wondered why you kept in touch after...  Everything
You were together for two years in boarding school, right
She was my first serious girlfriend
Why did you break up
Did you treat her bad
Did you cheat on her
That's a rude question
She dumped you, you completely unraveled
You stalked her, you threatened her...  And you attempted suicide in her bed and were institutionalized
Your wife is missing, and you came all this way to tell me this
I thought there might be another side to this story
Fuck
The missing persons case of Amy elliott dunne
She is the beautiful blonde inspiration for the amazing Amy kids' book series
You're reading that diary again
It interests me
Hey, Rhonda
"He's gonna kill me.
The end
It's private
There's no one there
Why didn't he make sure it actually burned
Because he tripped the alarm
The whole thing just feels hinky
Like finding an envelope marked "clue.
You ever hear the expression...  "The simplest answer is often the correct one"
Actually, I've never found that to be true
Good night
Hey
Thank God
Come on in
First thing you have to understand about Amy, she loves to teach lessons
Play God
Yeah, old testament God
Keep talking
She finds out I've been cheating on her with Andie..
Fakes her own death, frames me for it
Blood in the house, credit cards, life insurance
She does the treasure hunt
Now, the treasure hunt is critical
She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities
Rubbing my nose in it
And she leaves clue number one for the police..
Which is a place where Andie and I would often...  And she leaves a pair of red panties
Right
Racy, looks bad
Clue two
Another place where Andie and I would occasionally have relations
Woodshed
Also a location...  Oh, my God
We had limited options
A hotel
Put it on Andie's credit card
Andie's statement went right to her parents
Nick, margo, can we head over to the little brown house
This leads us to what
My dad's house
Dad's house is blue
I used to pretend that he was a spy named Mr. brown, who...  For the sake of his children's safety, had to deny their existence
You never told me that
You told her that
We've got incriminating red panties in your office
We've got a showcase showdown worth of crap in your woodshed
So, what in God's name is at your father's house, Nick
I honestly have no idea
Whatever they found, I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad
We got a lot of uncontained issues here
We haven't communicated since the vigil
Okay
Amy's parents
No, it's...  More pressure
We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will no doubt go public at any moment
She will
They always do
Amy's got us in an interesting bind
We need to tell the cops about Andie
Really
Right now, Andie just gives you another motive
We need to be on the front end of that
But I'm gonna warn you as to what will happen
They'll go after margo
They can't do that, can they
She's your accomplice
She helped you hide the evidence
God
Well, what are we going to do
No
Any other strategy is missing the point
I've got two exsecret service guys that are really good
I'll put them on it
Where would Amy go
I have no idea
Hey
I thought we were steering clear of men for a while
He's nice
Because he wants to fuck you
She's still moping about her ex
He got cheated on, too
We three are the saddest sacks in all the ozarks
I'm angry
There you go
I almost drank myself to death when my wife left me
Can you believe that
Don't give him the pleasure
I was going to drown myself in the Gulf of Mexico...  Let myself be dinner for the great whites
Gulf is bull sharks, miss nawlins
Why should I die
I'm not the asshole
Miss moneybags
That's a fat wad
It's mostly singles
Singles
What are you, a stripper
Swamp girls, or treasure chest
We're just teasing
Don't they tease people down in nola
We've got blood in the house, huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy
Crying out for justice
We'll be right back
Tanner has a very bad idea he's going to pitch you
You're doing Sharon schieber tomorrow in St. Louis
It could go so wrong
And you are going to tell her about Andie
Nope
That sounds like a very bad idea
You haven't heard from her in three days
You've gotta throw yourself on it
People are gonna hate me
And then, they will forgive you
A guy admitting that he's a gigantic asshole on television
Why don't we just put out a statement
They need to see you
Sharon's specials, they get 10 million viewers
She is a crusader
If she takes you on as a cause...  she's going to ask real questions
What to say, what not to say
A trained monkey who doesn't get the lethal injection
Nick, this case is about what people think of you
They need to like you
Now, you do this and you will reach millions of those people
Maybe I only need to reach one
Hello
Hey, baby
One minute
Hey
No, I'm just cleaning up
Let us come in and say goodbye
I'll come by before...  let us give you a hand
Yeah, you gotta clear everything out, here
Dorothy is a real stickler
Not even a spare hanger can you leave behind
A sock...  Or undies or what have you
You did a real good job
Look under her dress
He talked you into this
I talked him into it
The second you leave, I'm calling the cops
Your glasses are fake
You say your name's Nancy, but you don't even answer to it half the time
You're hiding
I don't know why, and I don't really care
But you ain't gonna call the cops
And I don't think you've ever really been hit before
Holy shit
Next place, be more careful, okay
There are a lot of people out there a lot worse than we are
Excuse me
You can't sleep here
A little less wooden
I didn't kill my wife
What are you doing
Every time you look smug...  Or annoyed or tense, I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear
That's supposed to make me less tense
Let's try it again
Yeah, we had some tough years
I lost my job
You both did
We both lost our jobs
I had to move back home so we could take care of my mother...  Who was dying of cancer and my dad, who had...  your dad's scorched earth
Go on
For a while, things had been building up
"Built up" implies that an explosion is coming
At a certain point, we got on the wrong track
I had a moment of weakness
I disrespected my wife
And I disrespected my marriage
And I'll always regret it
That works
Don't be afraid to play up the dufus husband thing, Nick
I'm a fuckup
"Everything I do is wrong.
I know
What men are supposed to do in general
Thank you
I feel good
Go, can you pass me that box, please
It's Amy's 33rd birthday present to me
You hate that watch
No, go
I love that watch
Just like I love my wife
It's you
It's you
I'm sorry
Good God
Last week..
I threatened to leave, and he said he'd find me and he'd kill me
I lost the baby
I couldn't even tell my parents
I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid
Well, he is looking for you
He showed up on my doorstep three days ago
You saved them
Knowing you were out there...  Was the only thing that's kept me going these past few years
Let's go to the police
You can explain everything
I'd be a pariah
Everyone would hate me
Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison
I'm setting you up at my lake house
It's utterly secluded
Why are you so good to me
You know why
I know you, don't I
No
No, we're from winnipeg
Excuse us
We should leave
That was boney
I'll call her later
Tanner
Nice to see you
Sharon
Hope this is worth my while
You're gonna be very happy
Sharon
Ms. schieber
Thank you so much for doing this
Can I get you anything to drink or eat before we get started
What the fuck
I'm sorry
We have a major shocking development in the amazing Amy disappearance
We go live to that story now
Oh, my God
My name is Andie Fitzgerald
When he was my creative writing teacher at mill valley
Why is she dressed like a babysitter
I am deeply ashamed...  Of having been romantically involved with a married man
I truly believed we were in love
Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite
I know that is no excuse
No, it is not
I do not, in my heart, believe Nick dunne would have killed for me
My prayers go out to everyone who loves Amy
I apologize for the pain this has caused them
We have loved Nick dunne like a son
He met our trust with lie after lie
We now absolutely believe...  Nick is involved in the disappearance of our daughter
Our amazing Amy
This just got very exciting
We need a moment
We're gonna have to bow out of this
Nothing has changed
Everything has changed
I can handle this
We're on the defense
This is a completely different dynamic
I can handle it
Just trust me
Okay
Great
Mic him
Thank you
He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist
Yeah, no kidding
Roll tape
Five... four...  Three... two..
Seriously, I can't believe how fucking good you were
Amy brings out the best in me
Don't
People still hate you
Women want to scratch your eyes out
Andie was really good TV
She's a good person
Ride this out...  And when Sharon airs tomorrow, we'll be looking at a whole new you
But, until then...  Don't show your face
No problem
Welcome
Make yourself at home
I've got music, satellite...  Netflix
He was her teacher
Internet, obviously
Here is a supposedly grown man...  if there is ever anything you have a taste for and you can't find it...  Just let me know and I will get it for you
And just think how her mother must feel at a time like this
Wine cellar's downstairs
I'll get you some clothes, too
The floors are heated, just dial to your liking
There's robes and towels
The shower has steam
The bathtub has a massage cycle
There's a great view, if you're in the mood
Blackout curtains if you're not
The bed is savoir
This is just what I need
I'm so exhausted
I'll leave you to it, then
Amy, I am so happy that you are here
And I don't want you to worry for one moment
The exterior, all along the grounds, the entryway
Anyone...  Who is caught coming or going...  Will be recorded
And I am not letting you get away again
Good morning
Don't do that
I'm sorry
I need to feel safe
What have you been up to
Amy, I'm not Nick
It's hard for me
After so many years under someone's thumb..
I know just what that feels like
On your leash
Never
A new start
Decent clothes
Hair dye
Makeup
Tweezers
There's a gym overlooking the lake
I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch Sharon schieber, and finally move on
I think that's something I should watch on my own
Nonsense
And I am looking forward...  To my reunion with Amy elliott
Good evening, I'm Sharon schieber
Tonight, exclusively..
Hurry up
A husband breaks his silence, not just on his wife's disappearance..
But on his infidelity, and all those shocking rumors
Nick dunne...  You're probably the most hated man in America right now
And I probably deserve it
I bought that tie
Did you kill your wife, Nick
I did not kill my wife
But you were unfaithful
I was unfaithful
And I am deeply ashamed
And, on top of that, you allowed Amy's parents..
Her friends, all the people in your hometown..
Believe you were a loving husband, desperate to find his missing wife
You say that, but I'm wondering how you expect us to believe you...  Now that we know you're a liar
I didn't come forward with my affair...  Because I knew it would make me look really, really bad
I just want to find my wife
I'm just trying to get clear...  Let me be clear
I'm not a good guy
I was a bad husband to a great wife
I broke the vow that I made to her
Those are pretty words, Nick
But what does that really mean to you
It basically means that I was a con artist
I met Amy elliott seven years ago
I was completely transfixed
And I met a woman who dazzled me
And I wanted her to love me..
So I pretended to be better than I was
When we got married, I promised to be that guy
That guy who works harder
That guy who, who lives and acts...  And loves with as much passion as she does
But I failed her
I did what was easy
You talk like a man who believes he can make amends to his wife
Who believes his wife is still alive
She is still alive
Will you look in the lens...  And talk to your wife
If she is out there, able to hear and see you tonight...  What would you like to say to her, Nick
Amy, I love you
And I've taken myself to the woodshed for the way that I've treated you
And if you come back, I promise..
I will spend every day making it up to you
I love you
Come home
Here
Regardless of what you thought...  What does it say
I think we can all agree...  Oh, my God
You fucking killed it
They're going crazy for you
They disliked me, they liked me, they hated me
And now they love me
He's certainly earned mine
What is it
Good night
Margo dunne, this is a search warrant for your property
I usually ignore tipline calls..
But a neighbor was concerned about a strange man around your woodshed
Call Tanner
Okay
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick
Is that what this is about
I have treated you more than fair throughout this entire investigation
Every time you said something stupid..
I thought, "maybe he's just stupid.
But I was wrong
That's what this is about
None of that is mine
None of this was put here by me
Those are nice clubs
You got the makings of a real man cave
Nick
You can't do that
Of course we can
Amy, it's time to move on
What can I do to help
I need some time to think
That's the last thing you need
Finally, last night, you came to me, and you chose me
Follow that instinct
I'm not gonna force myself on you
I understand what you're saying, desi
I do
I've forgotten how to behave
I'll move in here tomorrow...  And we'll work it out together
I just want you to be you again
They only took margo to fuck with you
I'm gonna go in, and I'm gonna tell them everything
What
We tell boney very little
So, you let them do all the talking
That way, we can jumpstart your defense
The truth is my defense
Recognize these
It's Amy's anniversary present to me
Was that how she told you she was pregnant, Nick
Mommy, daddy, baby, and that made you real mad
No
Recognize this
Never seen that before in my life
It's Amy's diary
We found this at your father's house
He's not a handwriting ex...  Looks like it
Our experts thought so, too
Do you wanna play a little true or false
"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips so he can taste me.
Yeah, that's true
That is also true, yes
She wanted to get pregnant, you assaulted her
I hit her
No, never happened
"Pushed," it says "pushed.
Absolutely not
She tried to buy a gun
I doubt that, but I don't know
Shall I read the last entry
Sure
In her own words, "this man may kill me.
It's kind of a convenient end note
For future reference..
The truth, you are not a handwriting expert
Okay, I know
Big as a twobyfour, right
Big as a club
We didn't know what the hell it was, but fire in July
We bagged it
I've never seen that before either
We just tested it
Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick
Do not say another word
What about my side
Nick
More coffee
Remember that time we skipped school and drove to the cape
God, yeah
Lobster right from the ocean
This reminds me of that
You're not bored
Desi, how could I be bored
You can discuss 18thcentury symphonies...  19thcentury impressionists, quote proust in French
I really have to get going
But I will be back just as soon as I can
My keys
Thank you
Dunne
You got one hell of a lawyer
Hey
Are you okay
Yes
Are you
Let's go
Well, you're out on bond
You can relax at home while we prep for trial
Keep your head down
Tanner, is there any fucking lead on Amy
I've got two of my best guys on it
She's air
I dare you
Mr. collings is home
I've missed you
I've been thinking..
I don't wanna be without you
Stay with me
And when all this dies down, we'll go to Greece, like you said
Octopus and scrabble
How long do you think until it's done
Six months for the trial
Sentencing will be quick
He'll appeal
I can watch the rest overseas
But I want it
Don't rush
Just do it
Harder
Her wounds are consistent with rape
There was semen present
We'll make sure it's a match
Yeah, it'll match
What do you think
Are we pals again
Now that I know you didn't murder your wife, yes
What do you think
Kidnapping
The story's insane
It's okay
I want to help
So we'll keep this very brief
Can you walk us through what happened
That morning, the doorbell rang
So normal
So strange
Since high school, he won't ever go away
And I've just tried to be nice to him
Answer his letters
Oh, my God
I've encouraged him
You can't blame yourself
He pushed inside
And he grabbed me
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen
I collapsed
That club was actually the handle to a punch and Judy puppet
Right
Treasure hunt
I'd hidden some puppets at go's...  then how did desi have that handle
It must have fallen off
So, he got it from me
About that woodshed..
He took me to his lake house
Tied me to his bed
Real quick
When you went to place the puppets there...  Did you notice that it was packed...  lots of stuff
Corresponding to purchases made on credit cards in your husband's name
Nick and credit cards
He buys, I nag
I don't know, probably
He hid a lot of stuff at go's
They're very close
Please continue, Ms. dunne
Desi assaulted me that night
Every night
He tied me up like a dog
Starve me
Shave me
Sodomize me
Please find this
She slit his throat with a box cutter
How did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter..
If he had her tied up the whole time
Can't you just be happy your wife is home and safe
Amy, we found your diary
It contains many concerning allegations of mental and physical abuse
Well, it's the ugly truth
Nick didn't want a baby
We had money problems
But I love him
Then why did you try to buy a gun
If I could just clarify one thing...  if this case had been left in your deeply incompetent hands...  My husband would be on death row...  And I'd be tied, still, spreadeagle...  Ms. dunne, you've been very brave
We're finished
Now, I have to ask you...  Do you feel safe going home with your husband
We prayed to God, and God has answered our prayers
Amy dunne is home
But for right now, we wanna sit tight...  And just be thankful and grateful for this miracle on the Mississippi
Excuse me
Excuse us, folks
We love you, Amy
I'm not pretending
You were perfect
You do know I was just telling you what you wanted to hear, right
That's how well you know me
You know me in your marrow
Okay
Take off your clothes
I need to make sure you're not wearing a wire
You killed someone, Amy
I'm a fighter
I fought my way back to you
You killed a guy
You slashed his throat with a box cutter
And I obliged
But I want that Nick
I'm leaving
You really think that's smart
Wounded, raped wife battles her way back to her husband...  And he deserts her
They'll destroy you
Neighbors will shun you
And I'll make sure that no one forgets the pain you caused me
I don't want anything to do with your groupies outside
Once they go..
I go
Sleep on it
There can be
Good night
Hey, Nick
Crepe
Sure
She was his dream girl
And when this spoiled, rich, entitled little boy couldn't have her..
You must be so proud
It's been four hours
Nick
Nick
What's next for you and Amy
When two people love each other and can't make that work...  That's the real tragedy
Kiss my cheek
I can't believe that fucking spider is America's sweetheart
She told me she killed desi
Not selfdefense
Murder
Can't we get a wire
Yeah, because she had me strip naked, and stand in the shower
I swear, you two are the most fuckedup people I've ever known
And I specialize in fuckedup
You and Amy under the same roof
You should pitch that as reality television
Nick and I have been through some bad patches
We've had our dark days
But we thank you so much...  For supporting us in our new life together, for forgiving Nick
Really, your encouragement means the world
She's good
The real housewives of branson
Take care of this guy, will you
I can't believe you're just leaving now
You are not at risk anymore
I'm the definition of "at risk.
You may wanna thank her
Just don't piss her off
See you, guys
Elvis has left Missouri
We need to check Amy's story, piece by piece
Nick, I can't do anything
We had the national spotlight on us, we stained the rug
That doesn't mean you have to be done
It does
Couldn't sleep
Come on...  Let me tuck you back in
You know you can sleep with me, right
Yeah, it's just..
I would never, ever hurt you
I do need you to participate, though
I need you to do your part
Okay
Everything you have heard about my wife...  Is a lie
She is a calculating, murderous psychopath
And I have been complicit...  Nick
Nick
Honey
Not the entire time, but on and off throughout
"So, Nick, how does it feel to have your wife back?
"It's fantastic
"How many people are lucky enough to get a second chance at love?
"Fantastic" is a little flippant
I need you to admit that you got the credit cards...  And that you hid all that stuff at go's and that you pushed me
I'm gonna need those three things to feel safe
Don't worry
I know exactly what to say
Nick
What a beautiful home
I so appreciate you giving us this time, Nick
You went on national television...  And told people that I murdered my wife
You implied that I had carnal relations with my sister
I didn't use the "I" word
I said you two were "extremely close.
You and a panel of nitwits diagnosed me as a sociopath
Icebreaker
To go with your robot dog
What is it
It's for you
Open it
I don't need any more gifts from you
Open it
I didn't touch you
You didn't need to
Bullshit
You threw it out
The notice, yes
I want a blood test
I want a paternity test
I love tests
You can teach those people to hate me all you want
I don't care
I won't have to teach your child to hate you
He'll do that all by himself
I'm the cunt you married
The only time you liked yourself...  Was when you were trying to be someone this cunt might like
I'm not a quitter
I'm that cunt
I've killed for you
Who else can say that
No way, baby
I'm it
Look, you're delusional
Why would you even want this
Yes, I loved you
And cause each other pain
That's marriage
Now, I'm getting ready
I can't watch you play house with that thing for the next 18 years
I can't just walk away
No, I won't
And you know it
It's gonna be my child
I'm not gonna leave it
You wanna stay
I have a responsibility
You wanna stay with her
Go, you're my voice of reason
I need you with me on this
Of course I'm with you
I was with you before we were even born
We've been through the darkness
We've come out, united
We communicate
We're honest with each other
And
And
We're gonna be parents
My goodness
Thank you
"What are you thinking?
"How are you feeling?
"What have we done to each other?
"What will we do?
I wrote it all down: 4,200 square feet, four floors
Courtyard in back, southfacing garden
Perfect
Shouldn't we wait for the car service
No, we'll sit in traffic forever
Is that the listing sheet
There is no listing sheet
It'll be gone by this afternoon   Well, how many more after this one
None
Sarah, do you have to ride that here
Mom, we're in the street
Evan
One day you will learn to respect people's time, Lydia
I’m so sorry
I’m meeting Arthur Digby Laurence in 26 minutes...  ...and if you think he's the kind of man who tolerates tardiness...  ...you are sadly mistaken
You're a saint to wait for us
Thank you
Hello
It’s kind of between a townhouse and a brownstone
Built in 1879, this is the middle of the house, the parlor floor
Here is the living room
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...  ...which was renovated in '94 with all the expected amenities
Sarah
There are two bedroom floors above
My God, it's amazing
Hey, kid
I don't have to tell you this amount of living space is uncommon in Manhattan
It’s got a yard
Sort of
It allows for an expansive garden
Working elevator
The previous owner was disabled the last years of his life
Highly unusual, the elevator
You will not find this in 90 percent of brownstones
Perhaps it's something of a fixerupper, but we anticipate enormous interest
Shall we have a look at the rest
You should make an offer immediately
Can I see it first
You can't move from Greenwich to the Upper West Side...  ...and expect to still have a house, a yard and a dog and cat, but here it is
It’s got everything you told me you wanted and more
You could have two
It’s a fortune
Mom, it's not Barneys
You don't have to pay the price on the tag
He can afford it
Hardwood floors throughout, as many as six working fireplaces
This is the top floor
Two bedrooms
They share one small bath
Originally, this would have been the servants' quarters
The previous owner kept a small nursing staff
I don't know if you have livein help
No, it's just the two of us
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, or what have you
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine, the financier
May I ask what you do, Mrs....  Altman
Actually, I’m going back to school
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals
I didn't realize you were Stephan Altman's wife
Yes, until recently
Master bath
Pearlstine's been in all the papers since he died
He was a recluse
Rich, paranoid
Now they can't find half his money
Stop calling it "the property.
It sounds ridiculous
Walkin closet
Could the little one please stop that
Kid, no elevator
That's strange
Is this room smaller than it should be
You're the first person to notice
On caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea
It’s called a panic room
What
A safe room
A castle keep in medieval times
They're in vogue in highend construction
One can't be too careful about home invasion
This is perfect
What will you do
Call the police and wait till Tuesday
Traipse downstairs in your underthings to check it out
Concrete walls
Buried phone line, not connected to the house's main line
Call the police, nobody can cut you off
You have your own ventilation system
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers nearly every corner of the house
This whole thing makes me nervous
Ever read any Poe
What's to keep somebody from prying open the door
Steel
Thick steel
Very thick steel
Full battery backup, so even if the power's out...  ...it's still functional
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he
Open it, please
And with kids like he's apparently got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide
Please open the door
That is highly inappropriate
My room
Definitely my room
That door is a hazard
Not at all
Motion detector, like an elevator
The door won't close if it's blocked
There's another one at your ankles
I know they'll take asking price
It’s working
I hooked up the phone
Good for you, Mom
Hooked up a phone
579 what
Patsy's Pizza
please hold
Hey
Enough
What do you mean
I should've thought of something special
I like pizza
Fuck him
Don't
Fuck her, too
I agree
Don't you think this place has way too many stairs
You didn't carry anything up them
You never asked what I thought of this house
I didn't want you to tell me you hated it
I liked our old house
You know what I was thinking
I was thinking we could stencil the whole bookcase
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves
Go ahead
Oh, damn
Dad already did it
I’m going with him on Sunday
So I’ll take a cab and meet him there
Is that what he said
Isn't that what's so great about Manhattan
You don't have to drive me everywhere
Why'd you bring me here if I can't go anywhere on my own
That's it
I quit
I’m not fighting with you till tomorrow
Come here
It’s disgusting how much I love you
Yeah
It’s too dark
Better
That's better
"Bypass nonready zone.
"Bypass nonready zone.

"Bypass nonready zone.

"Enter zone number.
"Shunt again.
ln the morning I got to figure out how to turn this thing off
Do it
Come on
Jesus fucking Christ
Amateur
We got a problem
We need to talk
It’s about time
I’m freezing my tits off out there
This is Raoul
Who the fuck is Raoul
Raoul is okay
Where'd you get him
Through some people
Open the fucking door
No shit
There's a girl on the top floor, a woman on the third
They're asleep
They're not supposed to be here
This is your department, Junior
They are not supposed to be here
We're on videotape
We've been on videotape since we got here and the tapes are upstairs
14day escrow
You fucked me
That's almost 3 weeks
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks
Business days
Escrow is always business days
Fiveday weeks always
Right
Just wait a minute
Wait a minute
We can handle this
Can we still handle this
It’s just a woman and a kid
Unless Daddy comes home
Daddy's banging some B model on the Upper East Side
It’s just her and the kid
Now, can we do this
Yeah, we can do it
And not with me
Wait
Twenty minutes
She'll call the police
They'll be here before I unpack my bags
So, we keep an eye on her
I don't want Raoul to administrate that
He's not even supposed to be here
Nobody gets hurt
What about us
What if she has a gun
Who are you
You know we can't do this without you
This is still a good plan
This is a great plan
It’s just got a slight twist
Felony kidnapping
Thirty years
You make a lot of promises, don't you
You promise me, you promise your kids
No family
You're right
It’s all fucked up
I fucked it up
Hey, I want that money
I want it
But you...  ...you need that money
Or have you forgotten why you're here
So let's quit dicking around, okay, and get this over with
Kill the phones
Top floor, little girl
Give me that
You stay here
Nobody gets past
Wake up
Get up
What did you do that for
Where are you going
What's going on
People
They're in the elevator, heading down
Fuck
They're coming down to you
I don't hurt people
They're going downstairs
That room
What
No, press emergency stop
Fuck
Coming back up
That's you
Go
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Mother...  Shit
That's seven years bad luck
Shit
Tell me they're not in there
It doesn't work
It’s a different phone line
I never hooked it up
Now what
I can't hear a thing
I don't know
Rob us...
I don't know
What do we do
We wait
Well, they can't
They can't get in
It’s not possible
Mom
I heard you
Do you feel okay
You shaky
No
No
Please
Don't worry about me
What do you think he'll do
Hang out while the cops waltz in
Use your head
Here he comes
I locked the roof access
She's not getting down from there
Good
Could she have hooked it up today
No
You don't just call up Bell Atlantic
I checked the paperwork and the phone is not connected
You see
I thought she wouldn't be here
He said she wouldn't
Fuck you
And fuck you
She is not supposed...  Do it
Excuse me
She's lying
You're full of...  It’s not an intercom
It’s a PA system
I know
I suggest you leave before they get here
What
He's saying that we don't have a phone
How could he know that
If only it were that easy
Some paper
I need some paper
Give me some paper
You going to help us out
You got a piece of paper
I don't know
"What we want is in that room"
They're coming in here, aren't they
I told you
They can't get in here
What do you know about this room
What do we know about that room
Just a few details
We're not coming out, and we're not letting you in
Get out of my house
Say "fuck.
You fuck
Mom
What
Get the fuck out of my house
She's a woman
Women need security
She won't believe you
She needs to know she's dealing with decent people and she can trust us
What
She's not coming down
Shut up
Will you please shut up and let me think
You know what
Fine
You think
What if she did call the cops
She didn't
If cops were coming, do you think l'd still be here
Okay, fine
Good, excellent
We all believe you
What is funny about this
Is this shit funny to you
I spent the last 12 years building these rooms...  ...to keep out people like us
It’s all so ironic and amusing, okay
We can't
You can't get in the panic room
That's the whole point
We have to get her to come out
And why would she do that
I don't know
We keep her here, we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...  ...and I don't want any help from Joe Pesci over here
They want to hole up in this house
Fine
We make it impossible for them to leave
I’m working on that
Are you okay
Yeah
I’m okay
You can't wig out
I know
I mean it
I won't
You know, people never get buried alive anymore
Really
Yeah, I read that
And when did this happen all the time
Twenty, thirty years ago
I don't know
They're locking us in
Sarah, calm down
You know what could happen if you let yourself get worked up
Sarah
What the hell are you doing
We're coming in from below
Even if you got through the concrete, there's steel
You won't even make a dent
We'll see
Hey
If some idiot with a sledgehammer could break in...  ...do you really think that I would still have a job
Don't get that in your eye
Neighbor
Help
Please help us
Help us
Help
Help us, please
Call the police
Shit
You guys just going to stand there
Why
He can't get in here with a hammer, can he
Could you be any louder
Give me a hand with those boxes
I’m in charge here
Now, what the hell is going on
They're going to get in here
No, they can't get in here
We'll be just fine
Oh, this is good
This could work
I was just thinking that we should do something like this
Open it
Open it some more
We're just sending them a message
They'll get the point
Honey, get down on the ground
Quit dicking around and open this fucking thing up
We're trying to scare them, not kill them
What is it
It’s bad
They're coughing
If they're coughing, they're going to die
Nobody is going to die, man
Will you please have the balls to follow through with something
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out
They'll have a hangover
How are we going to get in there if they pass out, Junior
They won't pass out, numbnuts
They'll throw up first
Stay on the ground and breathe
Turn it down
Turn it down
It’s too much
Don't you start up with this shit
I’m turning it down
Keep his ass off of me
We're not killing anybody
Tell him to turn it down
Turn the shit off
No
Mom
Just a second
Get under this
Fucking amateurs, man
It’s my fucking idea
Shut the fuck up
What is that
Turn the gas off
Turn the gas off right now
Get back
God
Get it off me
It’s okay
You fucking bitch
You fucking bitch
I’m coming in there
Calm the fuck down
Promise me you'll never do anything like that
I won't
They're moving
At least they're still moving in there
Talk to him
Please, man, give it a rest
That Morse code
SOS
Where'd you learn that
Titanic
We got to talk
No, no, no
Not you
Come on, come on, come on
Come on
Wake up
There's been a change here
$100,000 is not enough
Not for this shit
I want a third of whatever's in that room up there
Fine
Full share, onethird
Congratulations
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000
Your parents will be proud
Got him
Let me straighten out something else
I’m not losing my half of the money because..
Slow down
Half
Did you sleep through grade school
Five seconds ago, it was a third....  Come on
But this wasn't my idea, so he's your problem
You're right
It wasn't your idea
It was my idea
Come on, look over here
Yes, yes, yes
Let's hope this guy's an exBoy Scout
We're here
Help us
Help
Open your window
Help
We're never going to get out of here
Are you done
No
I’m the one the old man finally told about the safe
I’m the one who found the guy who built it, and I convinced him to break into it
Wait a minute
What
Where are they
Where's the third guy
I left my cell phone by the bed
I earned that money
I will not let you jeopardize my fucking plan...  ...because you have a problem relating to others
Got it
If I don't come back, close this door
Just do what I say
He touches me again, I’ll shoot him
Wait
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle, or can we get back to work
Don't take no tone with me, jerkwad
I’ll shove it up your ass and snap it off
You live in Flatbush
What is this
I got some news for you
Go
Go
Fuck
What did she get
No
Charger
She has a cell phone
All right, signal
Come on
Signal
I don't think they'll be talking on no cell phone from in there
Why not
You can't call out from in there
I didn't hook up this line, but I hooked up the main line
If we can find it, we can cut into it
I’m not built for that shit
Be careful
Get the phone
It doesn't come off
Rip it off
Screwdriver
Junior, when I asked you to cut the phone lines, did you cut the main line
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone in the kitchen
Strip this and expose the wires
What are we doing
I have no idea
Okay, got it
Yeah
Okay
Yellow, yellow
Okay
Dial tone
911 emergency
Please hold
No, no
Call Dad
How do you live in New York and not have a single Percocet
Stephan
Put Stephan on the line
Who is this
It’s Meg
Do you know what time it is
Put him on the phone, bitch
It's your fucking wife
Hello
You've got to help us
Move
They broke in...  What..
He'll do something
No, he won't
He'll call the police
You don't know her
She won't let him
He knows that there's trouble
He heard me
He's across the park
That's why we got houses close to each other
He'll help us
Yes, he will
I’m sorry
No, I’m sorry
Why
I was trying not to tell you
I’m dizzy and hungry
All she's got is Nyquil and fucking Midol
Looks like that gas idea didn't work so well
Whose fault was that
This is impossible
What's the plan now, hot rod
Here, drink this
All right, drink lots of water
You dropped to the low 40s
We have to get your bloodsugar up
Can you hear me okay
I’m just dizzy, not deaf
Great
Smart ass
Did you see anything in here
Any candy bars or something sweet
Let's check it again
Mom, I did it
If we stay calm, everything will be fine
Stay calm
You're making me nervous
I’m sorry
What if I keep dropping
You won't
I’ll figure something out
You know, he's right
What are you talking about
I don't need to be involved...  ...with anything so harrowing or perilous at this point in my life
You're giving up
Hell, yes
I don't need the fucking aggravation
I’ll make an anonymous phone call
They'll find the floor safe
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax
Take it
Go out and get loaded
Wait a minute
Say what you just said again
Say that shit about the money again, babycakes
Before
Yeah, before
Splitting the money in your head, you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand
What are you doing
That was after tax, which makes it more than a million and a half gross
So now you're a tax attorney
There's sugar in everything
Places you'd never expect
Like ketchup
Where else
Travel kit
A fuckup like you has got to get less than everybody else...  ...so now I don't know what to think
You're adding up money you'll never touch, buddy
How much is in there
Mouthwash
Saccharin
Hey, I’m talking to you
Answer me
There's more
And when were you going to tell us this minor economic detail
It’s totally fucking moot
Why are we having this conversation
What were you thinking
How did you expect to get away with this
What's the matter with you
You got us into this mess, and you were going to fuck us
You got yourself into this
You got the custody lawyers up your ass
Things didn't work out
Play past it
Sugarfree
Mints
Sugarfree
I’m opening that safe
It’s looking doubtful there, big guy
I will split the money with Raoul
But I don't ever want to see you again
Cops show up on my doorstep, we will know who sent them...  ...and we will fucking find you
I’ll see you, Burnham
Mom
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street a couple of times...  ...think you know all about it
You don't know nothing about me
Shut your eyes and don't turn around
Okay
You should see the look on your face
What's happening
Don't you fucking move
No, don't
Come here
Come here
Don't shoot, please
Shut it, lock it and get the fuck away from it
Stop it, you fucking...  Fucking what
Clown
ldiot
Who's the clown now
Me
That's right
It’s burning me
You
Remember that
Find out who the fuck that is
Give me your wallet
Give me your wallet
Stephan Altman
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan
Don't know
Cut off
Phones are dead
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan
He's telling the truth
Yeah
Yeah, he probably is
Because when I do this, people don't lie
What
What do you want
Get us into that room
I can't
You're full of ideas
You just got to squeeze one out
You've got till the count of three
Then you end up like Junior over there
One, squeeze
Two, squeeze
I don't know what to tell you
Three
Wait
Okay
I got an idea
Maybe
Help
Rubber Soul..
Stay warm, all right
Let It Be, Reviver, Sgt
Dad
No, no
Take it easy
Open the door
No
Don't open the door
Just make it look good
Don't you tell me what...  Open the door
Don't open..
Knock it off
You kill him, they'll never open that door
Oh, god
Lie down
Lie down
All right
You'll be fine
Come on
He's fucking crazy
You're a strong girl
You be strong
Be strong, sweetheart
Just get off him
It’s almost over
Yeah, that's it
That's it
I’ll be right back
It’s got blood on it
You might want to wear it inside out
Get your tapes
Who's this
It’s her kid
Who gives a fuck
Hurry up
Get your stuff
Hey, lady
Mom
What are you doing
We've got your kid
Come down here
Let's get this over with
Shit
What happened
No
Let her out
No
Where's your gun
I don't know
Open up
Open it
Shut up
Listen to me
She's got your gun
Stop screaming
Stop it
Put the gun down and step away from the door
You got to open the door
My daughter is very sick
She needs an injection
Do you hear me
Open the door so I can give her a shot
If I open the door, you'll shoot us
Give her the shot
Do you need this
Can you do this yourself
Coma
Die
Fuck
Open it
Put the gun on the floor
And go all the way downstairs
And I'll give her the shot, all right
I told you to leave the gun
If you pull any shit like that again, I will fucking kill her
Do you hear me
If you step outside, I’ll kill her
If I see a uniform inside this house, I'll cut her fucking throat
Yes
But please, just give her the shot
Please
Please
Don't fucking do it
While we're in here, she'll call the cops
Are you going to open the safe
Don't you look at me
You got to talk me through this
This right here
It’s this
Nice house you guys got
Dad's rich
Mom's just mad
Tap it
I wish I could have put my kid in a place like this
It’s not that I didn't try
Sometimes things, they don't work out the way you want them to
Done
Wasn't supposed to be like this
Nobody was supposed to even be here
Thanks...  ...Burnham
Wasn't supposed to be like this
She's going to be okay
It'll be over soon
Stephan
Oh, my god
Can you move
Not much
I think my arm is broken
Raise your arm
Try again
Come on
Try again
Meg, please don't do anything stupid
They're going to kill us
It'll be okay that way
Stephan, they'll kill her
Holy shit
She called the goddamn cops
You called the police
Of course, I called them
She killed the kid
She just killed her own kid
Don't say a word
No, her husband must have called them
Foreign son of a bitch
I told you
Where is she
There
What the fuck's she doing
I’m just trying to unlock....   Is everything okay
You all right, ma'am
It’s a little after 4:00 a.m.  We got a call, ma'am
Somebody called you
Can we come in
We'd like to come in
No, you can't come in
Ma'am, you sure you're all right
I’m fine
Well, you don't look so hot yourself, Officer Keeney
Come on, I’m freezing out here
"There are three.
What
Your husband said you called for help
Oh, that phone call
And your neighbors...  ...called in about some loud shouts or a loudspeaker of some kind
That was the TV
It’s off now
Can I just ask you one question
What was the end of that sentence
When you said, "There are three"...  ...what was the rest
Thank God I came to my senses before I said all that, and I hung up...  ...so nobody would ever have to know what I was thinking
Unless, of course...  ...two policemen came in the middle of the night and interrogated me
So, Rick, you want to go
Or do you want her to tell you which three things
All right
Ma'am...  ...if there's something you want to say to us...  ...but maybe you can't say it right now...  ...you might want to make some kind of a signal...  ...by blinking your eyes a few times
Something like that
Man...  ...you guys are good
You mean, like if there was somebody in the house or something
They really train you guys
No, I’m fine
Cross my heart
'Night, ma'am
This kid has seen my face
Yeah, well, that's not my problem
Yeah, it is
You're on the hook, too
Do one
Same price for the rest
Stay the fuck away from me
You know how this is going to end
Goddamn
Why the hell didn't we do that
What's she doing
What the fuck does she think she's doing
She's got your gun
Just let me drill, man
Empty
Come on, man
Bank bonds
Two, three, four, five....  Why are we doing this
Because it's going to come to that
There are 22
22 million dollars
That lying little shit
Lift
Christ, I’ll buy you new tools
You'll be okay
It’s glass
I got you
Hurry up
Watch the glass
Get down here
Wait
Wait
Dad, don't shoot him
Let my daughter go
We're finished
Your daughter's fine
We'll go out the back door
You'll never see us again
Let her go
It’s okay
Let's go
Let's go
Let her go
Let go of her
Sarah, come here
Put that gun down
Sarah, come here
Put that gun down
Do as I say
Don't be crazy, man
Let her go
Are you okay
Did they hurt you
Did they touch you
No
Shoot him
Get off her
You'll be okay now
Police
Don't move
Nobody move
Team two, upstairs
Team three, down
Are you okay
Are you all right
Don't move, motherfucker
Don't move
Move away from the wall
Get off the fence
Move
Put your hands in the air
It'll be okay
It’s fine, Dad
Is there anybody else in the house
No
It’s okay
I’m all right
I want to see the palms of your hands
Do you hear me
You're going to be fine
Everything is going to be fine
This sounds interesting

Then they heard the gun go off
Both barrels

Just look at all the passion on that wall
All but the paperwork

The kid
What kind of fucking question is that
There's always these questions with you

His wife killed him
Detective Somerset
I'm Detective Mills



..just get in town 20 minutes ago, they dump me here
Look, um... 
Mills
Sit, talk  I'd like to get to the precinct
You know, not much time for this transition thing
I meant to ask you something, when we spoke on the phone before
Yeah
Why here
WeIl, all this effort to get transferred
It's the first question that popped into my head
Or the same reasons you had before you decided to quit, yeah
You just met me
Maybe I'm not understanding the question
It's very simple
You actually fought to get reassigned here
I've just never seen it done that way before
It would be great



I want you to look and l want you to listen, okay
Now, l wasn't standing around guarding the Taco Bell
I've worked Homicide five years
Not here
I understand that
WeIl, over the next seven days, detective, you'll do me the favor of remembering that
I almost died
MAN 2: Shut the fuck up down there

But he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti for about 45 minutes now
MILLS: Wait a minute
DAVIS: Did l stutter
This guy ain't breathing unless he started breathing spaghetti sauce
MILLS: So that's how it's done around here
DAVIS: I beg your pardon, detective
If he wasn't dead, he would've stood up by now
AIl right, thank you, officer
Okay
Thank you
I wonder
MILLS: Don't know
How many times has Barney Fife found dead bodies that weren't dead
Drop it
Somebody phone Guinness
I think we've got a record here
<i>Better Homes and Gardens.</i>   Oof
Who said this was murder
Guy's heart's gotta be the size of a canned ham
If this isn't a coronary, well, ha, ha, I don't know
Whoops
How about that
We had this case once
Knife in his back
Gotta be murder, right
Anyway, big insurance policy involved, yeah
So the guy took the tip of the blade, stuck it in his own shoulder blades
And he must've screwed up a few times because there was multiples back there
Could you please be quiet
What
Got a bucket here
What's in it
Agh
Fucking vomit
Any blood in it
I didn't see any
Help yourself
O'NElLL: Oh, wonderful
Very moody
Thinking it's poison, Somerset
You girls have got Forensics waiting outside
Don't know if we'll all fit, though
There's room, light's the problem
Hey
Detective Mills, would you go help the officers question the neighbors
What
He's dead
Thank you, doctor
You've seen my files, right
Nope
I did my time on doortodoors and walking the beat
I did that shit for a Iong time
Badge on my belt says "detective.
That's the same as yours
Look, I made a decision
I had to consider the integrity of the scene
Couldn't worry whether you thought you were getting enough on the playing fieId
Hey, man.. 

..just don't be jerking me off, that's all I ask
He's been dead a long time
MILLS: Oh, man
How does someone let themselves go like that
SANTIAGO: lt took four orderlies just to get him on the table
How'd the fat fuck ever fit out his front door
Please
lt's obvious he was a shutin
See how big this stomach is
And the strange thing is, it stretches
Look at the size of the cardiac orifice, where the food  Wait, l see what you're pointing out, but that means nothing to me
Okay
He's got lines of distention across the duodenum
This man ate till he burst
He didn't really burst
Not all the way
He was hemorrhaging internally
And there was a hematoma in the rectus and transverse abdominis muscles
So he did die by eating
Yes and no
WeIl, I haven't figured that out yet
Gun pressed against his head
Pressed hard enough, sure
Fuck, yeah
Marks from the front side, flush with the muzzle
Took his time, too
Coroner said this couId've gone on more than 12 hours
Victim's throat was swoIlen, probably from the effort
And there was definitely a point when he passed out
Oof
Sadistic fucker, huh
SOMERSET: When you want somebody dead, you drive by and shoot
You don't risk the time it takes to do this
Unless the act itself has meaning
CAPTAIN: Come on
Somebody had a problem with the fat boy and decided to torture him
In the grocery bags, we found two receipts
That means the killer stopped in the middle
..  
..and made a second trip to the supermarket
Hey, man, it's his thing
This is beginning
We've got one dead guy, not three
No motive
Don't even start that big brain of yours cooking on this, alI right
Please, l'd Iike to be reassigned
CAPTAIN: What
What, whoa
What in the hell are you talking about
This can't be my last duty
It's just gonna go on and on and on
You're retiring
Won't be the first time you've left unfinished  Those other cases were taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible
And if I may speak freely
CAPTAIN: We're all friends here
Oh, come on, I knew it
This is not my first assignment, you dick
It's too soon for him
Hey, man, l'm right here
You can say that shit to my face
Captain, if we can just talk in private
This isn't working
It's a personal thing
Maybe Just shut up, Mills
This is Metro
You don't just get to swap
Say what
Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him
Sorry, but see you later
Have a nice time
No, I'm putting you on something else
Go on, Mills
Just go on
I'm sorry, old buddy
But it looks like you're stuck cleaning up the fat man
TALBOT: All right, here we go
All right, calm down
Calm down
Calm down
Quiet down
Now, here's how it's gonna work
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes and 10 minutes onIy
If those questions do not come in a calm, sane and orderly fashion


Detective
Detective
Can I have a moment of your time
No
I will not discuss the details of this ongoing investigation...  
..so don't even bother asking
MAN 1 [OVER RADIO]: <i>I've got shopping tools....</i>  WOMAN [OVER RADlO]: <i>That's 25 Berlin.</i>   MAN 2: That looks like him
WOMAN [OVER RADlO]: <i>Three items for your case number.</i>  What you guys got for me
Why don't you guys, uh, go get a coffee, huh
WOMAN [ON TV]: <i>We have this breaking story for you.</i>  <i>We're going to go live downtown...</i>  <i>...where defense attorney Eli Gould</i> <i>was found murdered this morning.</i>  <i>District Attorney Martin Talbot</i> <i>is taking questions from reporters.</i>   REPORTER 1 : <i>There could be a conflict of interest</i>  <i>That is ridiculous to the point of being</i> <i>offensive
There is no conflict whatsoever.</i>  <i>And any claim that there could be...</i>  <i>...is irresponsible.</i> REPORTER 2: Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot
Somerset
Come in
Have you heard the news
Eli Gould was found murdered this morning
Someone broke into his law firm and bled him to death
Wrote the word "greed" on the floor
CAPTAIN: Yeah, in blood
Mills is heading up the investigation
Uh, excuse me
Excuse me
Oh, okay
Well, good for him
What in the hell are you gonna do with yourself out there, Somerset
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm
Fix my house
Don't you feel it
Don't you feel that feeling
That's the whole idea
Hell, you can't leave all this
Guy's out walking his dog
Gets attacked
His watch is taken, his waIlet
While he's lying there on the sidewalk, helpless


..his attacker stabs him in both eyes
This happened just last night about four blocks from here
Yeah, I read about it
It's the way it's always been
Maybe you're right
CAPTAIN: You do this work
Maybe I'm wrong
Oh, uh, the coroner sent this down for you
Found them in fat boy's stomach, mixed in with food
Looks like plastic, little pieces of plastic
Set them on the desk, please

.
They were fed to him
Oh, Lord
This was found on the wall behind the refrigerator.. 
..in the obesity murder scene
"Long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to light.
It's from Milton
It means that this is beginning
Written in grease
There are seven deadly sins, captain
Gluttony
Greed
Sloth, wrath, pride, lust...   
..and envy
Seven
This is not even my desk
You can expect five more of these
Now, wait a minute
Somerset
He wanted it
Damn
I'm aIl over it
MAN: What's wrong with you
Far away from here
GEORGE: How you doing
Just a few things to look up
GEORGE: Okay
Sit where you'd like
How's everybody
MAN 1 : Hi, Smiley
MAN 2: Come on, George, the cards are getting cold
Gentlemen, gentlemen
I'll never understand



..a world of knowledge at your fingertips
What do you do
You play poker all night
Yeah, we got culture coming out of our asses
MAN 2: All right
You know, Smiley



..you're really gonna miss us
I just might
Goddamn poetrywriting faggot piece of shit
Fucker
Yeah
Thank you, Lord
Oh, l'm sorry
Be out of your way in a second
You want your chair
No
MILLS: Yeah
Phone
It's a package deal
Comes with the office
TRACY [OVER PHONE]: Honey
<i>No.</i>  You dingleberry, l , uh, told you not to call me here when I'm working
Yeah
Why
Why
Why
It's my wife
Sorry
She'd like to speak to you
Uh, this is Detective Somerset
<i>Oh, it's nice to speak with you.</i>  Well, it's nice to talk to you too
I appreciate the offer, but  Well, in that case I'd be delighted
<i>Great.</i>  Yes, thank you very much
See you later.</i>  Bye
Hon, what
WeIl
Sorry
What
I've been invited to a late supper at your apartment
At my How's that
Tonight
WOMAN [OVER RADlO]: <i>Twentyonefiftyseven.</i>  HelIo, men
Hi, loser
This is Tracy
Somerset
Hello
I'm very happy to meet you
I've heard a lot about you
It's William
Hmm, well, it's a good name, William
William, l'd Iike you to meet David
Okay, all right, I'm gonna  I'Il be right back
How are the kids
Come on in
Oh, good dogs
How are you, good dogs
How are you, pretty
How are you
You are
SOMERSET: Smells good
What
Oh
Yeah
Um, please have a seat, if you Iike
Would you like something to drink
Uh, no
No, thanks
I'll wait
Okay, you can just throw that anywhere
I understand you two were high school sweethearts
TRACY: Mmhm
Pretty hokey, huh
You know something
I knew on our first date that this was the guy I was gonna marry
Really
Mmhm
Really
I mean, that level of commitment
Oh, don't worry
I won't wear it to the dinner table
No, ha, ha
I, uh You know, no matter how often I see guns, I just  I can't get used to them
Same here
Why aren't you married, William
Oh, Trace, what the hell
It just didn't happen
It surprises me
It really does
Well


Anyone who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me disagreeable
Just ask your husband
Very, very true
So how long have you lived here
Too long
How are you liking it
It'll be good
WeIl, you get numb after awhile
There are things to any city
Subway
It's nothing
Real estate guy
Fucking piece of


He's... 
He shows us the place a few times
I think he's good
He's efficient
Tracy really likes him
Then l start wondering why will he only bring us here five minutes at a time, yeah
The soothing, relaxing, vibrating home, huh
I'm sorry
Yeah, all right, laugh it up
All right, already
The guy would've had to get in...  
..before the office was closed and security tightened
Now, Gould would've been working late
I'm certain
Infamous, really
Now listen, body was found on Tuesday morning
The office was closed on Monday, which means the guy could've gotten in Friday





..Sunday, maybe even Monday
Hey, look at this
Gould was bound, right arm almost free
Check out the scale
SOMERSET: A pound of flesh
Yeah
<i>Merchant of Venice.</i> Didn't see it
"This task done and he would go free.
I'm telling you that chair was soaked through with sweat
The killer would've wanted Gould to take his time
..  
Imagine it
There's a gun in your face
Which part of your body is expendable
What about the love handle
Cut along the side of his own stomach
All right, let's take a fresh look at these
Edit out the initial shock
..until it's an exhausted possibility
Just gonna get another beer
Beer
Uh, wine, pIease
He's preaching
He's punishing
There were seven cardinal virtues and seven deadly sins


..used as teaching tools
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like in, uh, The Parson's Tale and  What's this
Uh, Dante
Yeah
Well, parts
Hey, remember in, uh, Purgatory
Dante and his buddy, they're climbing up the hill.. 
..they're checking out all the sinners, yeah
Yeah, the seven terraces of purgation
Yeah, yeah, right
But there, pride comes first, not gluttony
Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider that the books were the killer's inspiration
The sermons were about atonement for sin
These murders are like forced attrition
Attrition
It's when you regret your sins, but not because you Iove God
Mmhm
No fingerprints
Nope
Totally unrelated victims
Yup
And no witnesses of any kind
WeIl, in any major city, minding your own business is a science
The first thing they teach women in rape prevention is never cry for help
Always yell "Fire.
Nobody answers to "Help.
You holler "fire," they come running
That's fucked up
He must've left another puzzle piece
You know what
This is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity
I'm still leaving at the end of the week
Oh, shit
No, wait, wait
Gould's wife
She was out of town at the time
What if it's a threat
WeIl, I put her in a safe house
She wasn't too happy about it
SOMERSET: What if it isn't something she has seen
Yeah, okay
What
I don't know
But that's the one thing
MILLS: Sign us in
GOULD: treat me like a prisoner
Why do you have a phone if l can't make long distance phone calls
Mrs. Gould
GOULD: Don't treat people like this
I truly am
I don't understand
Okay, l need you to Iook at each photo very carefully
Look and see if there's anything strange or out of place
Um, anything at all
You're sure
Okay
SOMERSET [WHlSPERS]: It's got to be now
There may be something we haven't seen
GOULD: Wait
What
Here
This painting, it's upside down
No, no
Those shots were taken before forensics
There's gotta be something
Moved the screws to rehang it
Yep
What the fuck is that
Switchblade
There must be something
He didn't paint the fucking thing
No, he's fucking with us, that's what he's doing
See this
This is us
Just wait a minute
Just wait a minute
You're kidding me
Call the Print Lab
Oh, man
No
MAN: I can tell you, guys, just by looking at the swirl pattern...  
..they're not the victim's fingerprints
I don't know, man
I say he's whacked enough
It doesn't fit
He doesn't wants us to help him stop
So many freaks out there doing their little evil deeds they don't wanna do
"The voices made me do it
Jodie Foster told me to do it.
You know, um, I've seen this baby take as long as three days to make a match...  
..so maybe you guys wanna cross your fingers somewhere else
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you
Yeah
SOMERSET: Hmm
Wish I still thought the way you do
Picking up the pieces
We're collecting all the evidence, taking all the pictures and samples
Writing everything down
Noting the time things happened
That's all
Putting everything into neat little piles and filing it away
On the off chance it will ever be needed in the courtroom
Picking up diamonds on a deserted island
MILLS: Bullshit
Even the most promising clues usually only lead to others
So many corpses roll away unrevenged
Don't try to tell me you didn't get that rush tonight
I saw you
We're getting somewhere
Wake up, Glimmer Twins
This guy goes by the name of Victor
His real name is Theodore Allen
He's got a Iong history of serious mental illness
His parents gave him a very strict Southern Baptist upbringing
But somewhere along the line, they fell short
Spent time in prison here a whiIe back for the attempted rape of a minor
But his lawyer saw to it that didn't last long
His lawyer, by the way, is the recently deceased Eli Gould
Greed murder victim
OFFlCER: Yes, sir
Victor's been out of circulation a whiIe, but there's still a residence in his name
You're not buying all this, are you
Doesn't seem like our guy, does it
You tell me
Our killer seems to have more purpose
You ever take a bullet
I've only taken my gun out three times with the intention of using it
Never pulled the trigger
Not once
Yeah, but, no, l never took a bullet, but I pulled my gun once, shot it once
RealIy
It was my first one of these
I was pretty shaky going in
I was a rookie then
Anyway, we bust open the door looking for this junkie and, uh...  
..the fucker just opened fire on us
One cop got hit in the arm
Christ, what was his name
You know, I mean, more like slow motion
I remember
..  
..riding in that ambuIance
Right there
Christ, what was his fucking name
OFFlCER 2: Let's do it
Let's do it
OFFlCER 1 : Go, go, go
Move
Okay
OFFlCER 3: Get up there
Hey
They love this
Police
Clear
OFFlCER: Clear
Clear
Morning, sweetheart
Get up now, motherfucker
Now
Get up, you sack of shit
Oh, fuck me
Dicks
Oof
Jesus
Victor
Yeah, it's just Victor
SOMERSET: Call an ambulance
OFFICER: What is this
CALIFORNIA: Hearse more like it
SOMERSET: Also Forensics
No one touches anything
It's some frigging wax sculpture or something
"Sloth.
MILLS: Oh, man
SOMERSET: Those pictures were dated three days ago
This must be the first one
Look
It's dated exactly one year ago today
He's laughing at us
You got what you deserved
CALIFORNIA: He's alive, he's alive
That cocksucker's alive
SOMERSET: Guns down
Still breathing
Guns down
Emergency on that ambulance
He's playing games
Look, we have to divorce ourselves from emotion here
Oh
No matter how hard it is, we have to remain focused
How's that
Are you listening to me
Yes, I can hear you
MAN: Excuse me
What are you doing
Closed crime scene, get out
UPI photographer
Get out
MAN: Hey, I got a fucking right to be here
MILLS: Get out of here
Jesus
Fucking jerk
Fuck you
Oh, yeah
MAN: I got your picture
MILLS: Yeah
Detective Mills, MlLLS, fuck off
MILLS: Fuck you
How do they get here so fucking quick
They pay police for the information
And they pay well

..  Those, ugh.. 

You know, they piss me off
It's okay
BEARDSLEY: A year of immobility seems about right



..judging by the deterioration of the muscles and the spine
Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his system

..which must've been administered to keep the bed sores from infecting
Now, has he tried to speak or communicate in any way


..he chewed off his own tongue long ago
SOMERSET: Uh, Doc
Is there absolutely no chance that he might survive
Detective, he'd die of shock right now if you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes
Give or take
And he still has hell to look forward to
Good night
MAN [ON RADIO]: Tonight we bring you <i>the Charlie Parker Quintet.</i>  <i>Featuring Sir Charles Thompson on piano,</i> <i>Herb Pomeroy's trumpet...</i>  <i>...Jimmy Woode, bass, Kenny Clarke, drums,</i> <i>and the alto saxophone of Charlie Parker.</i>  Yeah
TRACY [OVER PHONE]: HeIlo, William
Is everything all right
<i>TRACY: Yeah, yes, everything's fine.</i>  Where's David
Um



What can I do for you, Tracy
I, uh....  Um, heh
I need someone to talk to
..maybe tomorrow morning
I don't understand
<i>I feel stupid calling, but, uh...</i>  
There's no one else
<i>If you can, just, uh, give me a call, okay?</i>  <i>I have to go now.</i>  <i>Well, good night.</i> Good night
TRACY: I mean, you know this city so well
You've been here so long
SOMERSET: It can be a hard place
I don't know why I asked you to come
Tell him how you feel
I can't
Especially now
I'll get used to things
l think I just



I wanted to talk to someone who's lived here for a long time and...
I mean, upstate, you know, it's a completely different environment
Did David tell you that I teach fifth grade
Well, I did
I've been going around, you know, looking at schools
What about private schools
I don't know
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you, Tracy
David and I are gonna have a baby

.
I don't think I'm the, heh


I'm the one to talk to about this
I hate this city
It was very much Iike a marriage
We got pregnant
This was a long time ago
I remember getting up one morning and going to work



..the pregnancy
And l felt this fear for the first time ever
I remember thinking how can I bring a child into a world like this
How can
How can a person grow up with all this around them
And over the next few weeks
.. l wore her down
I wanna have children
I can teIl you now that



I'm I know, l mean

I'm positive that I made the right decision
But there's not a day that passes



..that l don't wish that I had made a different choice


The baby, I mean, if that's your decision



But if you choose to have this baby



..you spoil that kid every chance you get
That's about all the advice I can give you, Tracy
I got to go
SOMERSET: Victor's landlord said there was an envelope of cash in the office mailbox
..  
..the first of every month
Quote:  "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in Apartment 306
And nobody ever complained about him
He's the best tenant I've ever had," end quote
Yeah, a landlord's dream
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue
Who pays the rent on time
I'm sick of all this waiting
Why aren't we out there, huh
Why do we gotta sit here rotting, waiting till the lunatic does it again
It's dismissive to call him a lunatic
Don't make that mistake
Look
Right now he's probably dancing around in his grandma's panties
Yeah, rubbing himself in peanut butter
Ooh
How's that
His luck will run out
Not depending on luck
One year to the day
He wanted us to
Don't know that for sure
This note he left
His first words to us
Fuck him
So what
Imagine the will it takes to keep a man bound for a full year
To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints
To insert tubes into his genitals
This guy is methodical, exacting, and worst of all, patient
He's a nut bag
And just because the fucker's got a library card doesn't make him Yoda
How much money you got
50 bucks
SOMERSET: I propose a field trip
Come on
We'll make a list
Ask yourself Hey, wait, wait
What are his interests now
Jack the Ripper, for instance
MILLS: Where are we going
SOMERSET: Library
MAN: Coupons, coupons, free coupons
Discount Discount coupons
They must've had about 50 health violations during the last inspection
I don't want people thinking we're dating
Give me your money
I'm giving you this, but for some reason, I don't think I know what we're doing
GREASY: Hey, Somerset, how you doing
Okay
Didn't figure this was a mÃ©nage Ã  trois
Sit down
Only for you do I do this, so it's a big risk
So I figure we're just fair and square
It's a deal
AIl right
Yeah, help yourself
WeIl, that was money well spent
All right
By telling you this, l'm trusting you more than l trust most people
WeIl, good, because l'm ready to punch you
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth
The guy in the pizza parlor is a friend from the Bureau
See, for years the FBI's been hooked into the library system, keeping records
Mmhm
Assessing fines
No, monitoring reading habits
Look
Certain books are flagged
Books on, say, nuclear weapons and, well, Mein Kampf
..  
..has his library records fed into the FBI's computers then on
Wait, wait, wait, how is this legal
Oh, legal, illegal
These terms don't apply
Oh
It's just a useful guide
It might sound silly, but you can't get a library card
..  
..without, uh, an ID and a current phone biIl, see
So they run a list
Precisely
It could give us a name
Could get a name of some college kid writing a term paper on 20thcentury crime
At least you're out of the office
Get a haircut
I don't
Neither do you
Exactly
<i>"The Divine Comedy.</i> <i>History of Catholicism
"</i>  There's a book called <i>Murderers and Madmen.</i>  <i>"Modern Homicide Investigation,</i> <i>ln Cold Blood.</i>  <i>Of Human Bondage.
Okay
<i>"The Marquis de Sade
"</i>  It's the Marquis de Sade
Whatever
<i>"The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqua"</i> Something
Saint Thomas Aquinas
He wrote about the seven deadly sins
Yeah
Let's try it
Jonathan Doe
Whatever
SOMERSET: We're sure about that name
MILLS: Yeah
You wanna go back, l'll go back
Let's take a Iook at him
Talk to him
Ah, we'll just talk to him
Uhhuh
"Excuse me, sir
Are you by any chance a serial kiIler?
Okay
Put that silver tongue of yours to work
No
You been talking to my wife
This is retarded
<i>Charlie's Fucking Angels.</i>  A name off a computer
Fuck
You hit
MILLS: He's going down, he's going down
Fifth floor
Mills
GIRL: Mommy
Police
ls there a back way out
Lock your door
MAN: What the hell is going on, man
Get out of the fucking hall, please
Get down
Hey
Get the fuck down
Shit

MILLS: Get out of the fucking way
Move
No
Mills
Mills, you okay
I'm all right
I'm all right
I'm going in
No, no, no
Wait, wait, wait
What are you talking about
He shot at us
You can't
The hell we can't
We need a warrant
We got probable cause
Come on
Think about it, think
Huh
I can't tell anyone this, l can't tell anyone
Oh, come on, out of the way
We have no reason to be here
Get off
Listen to me, listen
Get the fuck off me
But would you just pay attention a minute
If we leave a hole like this, we won't be able to prosecute
The fucking guy will walk
Now, is that what you want
By the time we clear a warrant, someone else   No, fuck that
No, no
Think about it
Okay
Okay
You're right
l'm all fucked up
WeIl, no point in arguing anymore
Unless you can fix that
So, yeah, like, l noticed this guy going out a lot
When the murders was happening, so l, um...
So So you called Detective Somerset, right
Yeah, right, right, so l called the detective, because this guy was creepy and shit
And one of the murders, it happened right over there
Okay
You got it
Called the cops
Good
Got your story
You gotta sign
Okay
Good, good, good
All right
You did good
WOMAN: l did what you said
MILLS: Here you go
You get something to eat, all right
You eat
SOMERSET: Everybody, stay outside
Somerset
Yeah
What
We had him
What are you talking about
The fucking photographer in the fucking stairs
You're sure this is him
Yup, good, good
Yeah, good, get it out
SARA: All right
Uh, we've got nothing, no pay stubs, no appointment books, no addresses
This is the best, this receipt
Keep looking
This was under the bed
Uh, his only source of funds
No kidding, we got his money
Fucking A, l like it
SARA: One thing
You're probably not gonna believe this
We haven't found a fingerprint yet
Um, not a single one
You're right, l don't
Keep looking
We could use some more men here
What are you getting with all this
And each notebook contains about 250 pages
Forget it
Anything about the killings
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are, and what a gross stage we dance on
Not a care in the world
Not knowing that we are nothing
We are not what was intended.
No, wait, there's a lot more
"On the subway today, a man came up to me to start a conversation
He made small talk, a lonely man, talking about the weather and things
But my head began to hurt from his banaIity
I almost didn't notice it had happened, but I suddenly threw up all over him
He was not pleased
And l couldn't stop laughing.
No dates
Just his mind poured out on paper
Looks like a life's work
If we had 50 men reading in 24hour shifts, it'd still take two months
MAN: Where's that phone
Phone
Phone
People, quiet
Hello
JOHN [OVER PHONE]: I admire you
I tell you <i>JOHN: No, listen, all right?</i>  <i>I'll be readjusting my schedule</i> <i>in light of today's little setback.</i>  <i>I just had to call</i> <i>and express my admiration.</i>  <i>Sorry l had to hurt one of you...</i>  <i>...but I didn't really have a choice, did I?</i> Hmm
JOHN: <i>You will accept my apology, won't you?</i>  <i>I feel like saying more,</i> <i>but I don't wanna ruin the surprise.</i>    JOHN [ON RECORDER]: adjusting my <i>schedule after today's little setback.</i>  Got it
All right, everybody, back to work
You were right
SOMERSET: Hmm
Yeah
These murders are his sermons to us
Look, we know him, we know him, we know him
Who's the blonde
Maybe
She caught John Doe's eye
BILL: Yeah, he came and collected it last night
BILL: Yeah
This man
Yeah, John Doe
It's an easy name to remember
He had a limp
What was this job you did for him
Hang on
I thought he was one of them performance artists, that's what I thought
You know, the sort of guy that pisses in a cup on stage and, uh, then drinks it
Performance art
Hmm
You made this for him
Yeah, I've made weirder shit than that
So what
They found the blonde
The picture
OFFlCER: We need you to move, paI
MAN: l'll come out, but you guys  OFFlCER: Get the fuck out of the booth
I've been in this cage the whoIe time
Okay
I'm not fucking with you
Come on, this way
Yeah, we're working on it
We're looking for the guy
You  You better see this
Yeah
All right
Got him
MAN: Get this thing off of me
Oh, God, get this thing off of me
Get this thing off of me
Get this off
Get him out of here, now
MILLS: Come on, I wanna hear it again
Tell me again
MAN: Just I don't know
You heard nothing strange, you saw nothing strange
MILLS: No
He asked me if I was married
And l could see he had a gun in his hand
Where was the girl
The what
What
Where was she
They want to go downstairs and wanna get a little ooh Ia Ia
Whatever
They got to come to you, yeah
You didn't see anyone
With a package
A knapsack
Something under their arm
Hey, everybody that comes in there's got a package under their arms
She was just sitting on the bed
Who tied her down
You or him
Do you like what you do for a living
These things you see
No
No, I don't
He had a gun and he made it happen
He made me do it
He put that thing on me
Then he told me to fuck her
And l did
l fucked her
Oh, God
Oh, God
<i>Fuck.</i>   <i>Oh, God, God.</i>  <i>God, help me
Please, please, help me.</i>  <i>Please, please, help me.</i>   You know, this isn't gonna have a happy ending
It's not possibIe
Hey, if we catch him, I'll be happy enough
If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil  I mean, if he's Satan himself, that might live up to our expectations...  
..but he's not the devil
He's just a man



..see, you bitch and you compIain and you tell me these things
But you gotta be a hero
You wanna be a champion
Let me tell you, people don't want a champion
How did you get like this
I wanna know
Ah
Go on
I just don't think I can continue to live in a place that embraces and nurtures apathy


..as if it was a virtue
You're no different, no better
I didn't say l was different or better
HelI, I sympathize
I sympathize completeIy
Apathy is a solution
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself in drugs than it is to cope with life
Yeah
It's easier to steal what you want...  
.than it is to earn it
Yeah
It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it
Hell, love costs
lt takes effort and work
We are talking about peopIe who are mentaIly ill.  We are talking about people, fucking crazies
No, we're not
Yes, today
We're talking about everyday life here
Fuck off
See, you should listen to yourself
Yeah
You say that the problem with people is that they don't care
So l don't care about people
You know why
Uh, you care
You wanna know
Damn right



..because you believe these things you say
I don't
You want me to agree and say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right
It's all fucked up
It's a fucking mess
We should alI go live in a fucking log cabin.
But l won't
I won't say that
I do not
I can't
I'm gonna go home
I love you, honey
So much
TRACY: I know
Could you repeat that
JOHN [OVER PHONE]: <i>I've gone and done it again.</i>  What have we got
Uh, sleeping pills
Glued to one hand
TeIephone glued to the other
He sliced her up
Then he bandaged her
CalI for help and you'll Iive
Or you can put yourself out of your own misery
Come on
Cut off her nose
And he did it very recently
SOMERSET: Listen
I've decided to stay on till this is done
I figure one of two things will happen
We'lI get John Doe or he'll finish his series of seven and this case will go on for years
MILLS: Hey man, you don't have to do me any favors
Thank you, but I got it
SOMERSET: I'm requesting that you keep me on as your partner for a few more days
Hey, we're here
SERGEANT: Wonderful
Your wife called
Get yourself an answering machine
JOHN: Detective
No big surprise
JOHN: Detective
You're looking for me
Hey
Don't you fucking move
Keep away from him
MILLS: On the fucking floor
I know you
Now
Get down
Get down on your stomach, you piece of shit
All the way
All the way, fucker
Down
Faster
Faster, fucker
Now
Nose on the ground
Jesus Christ
I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please
CAPTAIN: He cuts the skin off the tips of his fingers
That's why we couldn't find one single usable print in his apartment
Looks like he's been doing it for a quite sometime
MILLS: What about the bank accounts
The guns
CAPTAIN: So far everything's a dead end
No employment records
His bank account's only 5 years old and it was started with cash
We're even trying to trace his furniture



Because he's John Doe by choice
Okay, so when do we get to question him
CAPTAIN: You don't
He going to court now
I'm telling you, there's no way he'd turn himself in
It doesn't make any sense
Well, there he sits
He's not finished
No, he's pissing in our faces
We're just taking it like idiots
You know what l'm talking about
For the first time ever, you and I are in total agreement
He wouldn't just stop
SOMERSET: He's two murders away from completing his masterpiece
We'll wait for his plea
My client says there are two more bodies
He will take Detectives Mills and Somerset to these bodies


..but only Detective Mills and Somerset, only at 6:00 today
Why us
He says he admires you
It's part of the game
The client claims if the detectives do not accept this...  
.these bodies will never be found
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot
Hey
We've got him
Downstairs, locked up
Done deal
Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable
Why are we having this conversation
Mills
Hey, something stinks
And this one here  Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit and that smug smile on your face...  

.dealing for that shit, l don't Iike it MilIs




.to the best of my ability
To serve their best interest
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr
My client wishes inform you if you do not accept...  
..he will plead insanity across the board
TALBOT: Let him try it
Come on, now, we alI know the extreme nature of these crimes...  
.. l could get him off with such a plea
I'm not letting this conviction slide
I can tell you that
..he'll sign a full confession, plead guilty right now
Make a decision
Full confession
I'm in
It has to be the both of you
The fact that he's blackmailing us with his plea
And my client would like to remind you two more are dead
Press would have a field day...  
..if they find out the police didn't seem concerned about them
Giving them a proper burial
If in fact there are two more dead
They did a quickie on Doe's clothing and nails
From him slicing his fingers
Blood from the woman who's face he cut off
And blood from a third party, as yet unidentified
You'd be escorting an unarmed man
Let's finish it
SOMERSET: If John Doe's head splits open and a UFO should fly out
.. l want you to have expected it
I will
Hey, man, if l was to accidentally shave off a nipple...  
Hmm
I suppose so
Yeah
If you were man enough...  
..to actualIy file a claim, I'd buy you one out of my own pocket
You know



Yeah
ON RADlO]   ON RADlO]  Let's go
PILOT [OVER RADIO]: <i>CVictor55 take
Clear the TC.</i>  Pull around
<i>There it is.</i> <i>Latemodel black sedan at your 10 o'clock.</i>  ON RADlO]  Who are you, John
Who are you really
At this stage, what harm can it do to telI us a bit about yourseif
Who I am means absolutely nothing
You need to stay on your left up here
So where are we heading
You'll see
That wouldn't be shocking enough
We've got newspapers to think about, yeah
Wanting people to listen...  
You have to hit them with a sledgehammer
And then you'll notice you've got their strict attention
MILLS: But the question is:  What makes you so special that people should listen
I'm not special
JOHN [ON RADlO]: <i>I've never been exceptional.</i>  <i>This is, though, what I'm doing.</i> <i>My work.</i>  Your work, John
Yes
That's not true
No, it is true
..two months from now, no one's gonna care
No one's gonna give a shit, no one's gonna remember
You can't see the whole complete act yet
But when this is done...  
..when it's finished...  
..it's going to be


People will barely be able to comprehend
But they won't be able to deny
I mean, as far as master plans go, John  I can't wait for you to see
l really can't
WeIl, you know what
I'm gonna be standing next to you
So when this big thing happens, you be sure and let me know
Because I wouldn't wanna miss it
JOHN: Oh, don't worry
You won't
You won't miss a thing
It's not too far now
PILOT: <i>Hightension lines ahead.</i>  <i>Prepare for frequency change.</i>  I've been trying to figure something in my head
And maybe you can help me out, yeah
When a person is insane, as you clearly are


..do you know that you're insane
Maybe you're sitting around, reading Guns and Ammo...  
..masturbating in your own feces, do you just stop and go:  "Wow, it is amazing how fucking crazy I really am"
Do you guys do that
It's more comfortable for you to label me insane
It's very comfortable
But l did not choose
l was chosen
MILLS: Well, whatever
But seems to me that you're overlooking a glaring contradiction
Meaning what
Glad you asked
..that is, by a higher power...  
..and if your hand was forced...  
..it seems strange to me that you'd get such enjoyment out of it
You enjoyed torturing those people
This doesn't seem in keeping with martyrdom, does it
John



Isn't that true
How happy would it make you to hurt me with impunity
That hurts my feelings
I would never You wouldn't because there's consequences
It's in those eyes of yours, though
I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner
Wait a minute, l thought all you did was kill innocent people
Innocent
An obese man
A disgusting man who could barely stand up
A man, who if you saw him whiIe you were eating.. 

..you wouldn't be able to finish your meal
And after him, lawyer
You must've secretly been thanking me for that one
This is a man who dedicated his life...  
..to making money by lying with every breath that he could muster...  
..to keeping murderers and rapists on the streets
Murderers, John, like yourself
A woman...  
..so ugly inside that she couIdn't bear to go on living
..  
..if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside
A drug dealer
And let's not forget the diseasespreading whore
OnIy in a world this shitty


..could you try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face
But that's the point
We see a deadly sin on every street corner.. 

We tolerate it because it's common, it's
..
We tolerate it morning, noon and night
Well, not anymore
I'm setting the example
And what I've done is gonna be




..and studied


..and followed


..forever
Yeah
You should be thanking me
Why's that, John
Because you're going to be remembered after this
Realize, detective, the only reason that I'm here right now...  
..is that I wanted to be
No
Oh, really
So, what were you doing, biding your time
Toying with me
Allowing five innocent people to die until you felt like springing your trap
Tell me, what was the indisputable evidence you were going to use on me.. 

John, calm down
Oh, that's right
And l seem to remember breaking your face
You're only alive because I didn't kill you
Okay, sit back
I spared you
Sit back
Remember that every time you look in the mirror
..at that face of yours for the rest of your life...  
..or should l say for the rest...  

MILLS: Sit back
Shut your fucking mouth
You're no messiah
You're a movie of the week
You're a fucking Tshirt at best
I don't mourn them any more



..than the thousands that died at Sodom and Gomorrah
Is that to say, John, that what you were doing was God's good work
Do you see those hightension towers
JOHN: That's where we're headed
PILOT: I see where
<i>Right to your 9 o'clock</i> <i>and follow that access road.</i>  MAN: <i>Your signal's breaking up, Viking.</i>  <i>PILOT: Unfuckingavoidable, Center.</i> <i>We're in powerline city, deal with it.</i>  This sure as shit is no ambush out here
Can't Iand anywhere near
They're gonna be coming up behind us in about two minutes
I want you to go up, way up
Thirty seconds, bank east on my mark
Thirty seconds
I'm getting him out
Stay
What do you got
Dead dog
I didn't do that
Why
I'd like to know
Sevenohone
It's close
Let's go take a look
It's this way
They're away from the car.</i>  <i>Coming in closer.</i>  <i>We got them
We got them
Closing in.</i>  PILOT 1 : <i>Negative
Hold your go.</i>   Mills
Down, down, down
Watch him
There he goes
JOHN: <i>It's good we have some time to talk.</i>  PILOT: <i>Van approaching.</i>  Stay on the guy in red
Do not take the crosshairs off the guy in red
Just stay down.</i>  There's a van coming down the road
Be ready for anything, now
Wait for my signal
Wait for me
Get out of the van
SOMERSET [ON RADlO]: <i>Out!</i>  MAN: Jesus Christ, man
Step away
Turn around
Put your hands on your head
CALIFORNIA: What the hell is going on
I'm delivering a package
I got this package for this guy, David
Uh, Detective David Mills
Get it
Slowly
He's opening the back of the van.</i>  <i>We've got him in sight.</i>  This guy paid me 500 bucks to bring it out here, man
He said he wanted it here at exactly 7:00
Put it down
SOMERSET: <i>We got a box.</i>  We got a box
CalI the bomb squad
We got a box
SOMERSET: Face the van
Hands up
Turn around
Go
Go
PILOT: <i>Do you want us to pick this guy up?</i>  I'm sending the driver out on foot
<i>PILOT: Got the driver in sight.</i> He's headed north
Have him picked up
Oh, l don't know
JOHN: When l said I admired you, I meant what I said
SOMERSET: It's blood
JOHN: You've made quite a life for yourself
JOHN: You should be very proud
Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit
PILOT: <i>Someone lost contact, copy.</i>  California, stay away from here
Stay away from here, now
Don't come in here
<i>Whatever you hear, stay away.</i>  John Doe has the upper hand
Mills
SOMERSET: Throw your gun down
I wish l could've lived like you
Shut up
What the fuck you talking about
SOMERSET: Go away
Do you hear me, detective
What
Tracy
SOMERSET: Mills
What'd you fucking say



..from the men in your precinct
CALIFORNIA: What the fuck
SOMERSET: <i>Throw your gun down!</i>  JOHN: I visited your home this morning
SOMERSET: Mills
I tried to taste the life of a simple man
SOMERSET: Throw it away
Tsk, it didn't work out
So...
I took a souvenir
Her pretty head
SOMERSET: Mills
Mills
Give me your gun
What's going on over there
I saw you with a box
What was in the box
Because I envy your normal life
Put the gun down, David
It seems that envy is my sin
Oh, what's in the box
What's in the box
SOMERSET: Give me the gun
He just told you
You Iie
SOMERSET: David
That's what he wants
He wants you to shoot him
No
You tell me that's not true
That's not true
Become vengeance, David
Oh, she's all right

.wrath
Tell me she's all right
If you murder a suspect, David No
SOMERSET: You throw it all away, he knows it
No
She begged for her life
She begged for her life and for the life of the baby inside of her
Oh
He didn't know
Give me the gun, David
If you kill him...  
..he will win
Oh, God
CALlFORNIA: Oh, fuck, he shot him
<i>Set it down somewhere.</i>  <i>Come on, set us down.</i>  <i>Holy Christ
Somebody call somebody.</i>  <i>Call somebody.</i>   WeIl, we'll take care of him
Where are you gonna be
Around
I'll be around

What are you looking at, Caroline
The wind, mom
They say the hurricane is coming
I'm on a boat
Can I do anything for you, mom
Make anything easier
Oh, sugar..
There's nothing left to do
Is what it is
Finding it harder to keep my eyes open
My mouth's full of cotton
Do you want any more medication, mother
Doctor said you could have as much as you want
No need for anybody to suffer
A friend told me that she never had the chance  to say goodbye to her mother
I wanted to


I wanted to tell you how much Iâ€™m gonna miss you so..
Mom
Are you afraid
I'm curious
What comes next
My father was there the day it opened
He said they had  a tuba band playing
They had the finest clockmaker in all of the South  to build that glorious clock
His name was...  Mr. Gateau
Mr. Cake
He was married to a Creole of Evangeline Parish  and they had a son
Mr. Gateau was, from birth, absolutely blind
When their son was old enough, he joined the army
For months, he did nothing but work on that clock
One day,  a letter came
And Mr. Gateau, done for the night,  went up, alone, to bed
And their son came home
Mr. Cake worked on his clock,  laboring to finish
It was a morning to remember
Even Teddy Roosevelt came
Itâ€™s running backwards
I made it that way  so that perhaps the boys that we lost in the war  might stand and come home again
Home to farm,  work,  have children
To live long, full lives
Perhaps my own son might come home again
Mr. Cake was never seen again
Some say he died of a broken heart
Some say he went to sea
Excuse me
Do you mind if I make a call
Somebody's watching my little boy
Sure
You couldn't disappoint me
Well, I know I don't have much to show for myself
Find my dark suitcase
This
Could you read it to me
I tried to read it a hundred different times
Mom, it's not exactly


Itâ€™s just the sound of your voice, darling
Itâ€™s dated April 4th, 1 985
And it says New Orleans
"This is my last will and testament
"I don't have much to leave, few possessions, no money, really
"I will go out of this world the same way I came in, alone and with nothing
"All I have is my story,  "and Iâ€™m writing it now while I still remember it
"My name is Benjamin
And I was born under unusual circumstances
Thank God it's over
We won the war
The Great War is over
What are you doing here
Thomas,  Iâ€™m afraid she's going to die
What
All of you, get away from her
I came as quickly as I could
The streets are filled with people
Thomas
Promise me he has a place
And for that, I am forever grateful
Mr. Button
Thomas
Thomas
Thomas
Where are you going
Hey
What are you doing there
Come on, Queenie
Now, Mr. Weathers
Come on
Just take some time
Stop all this foolishness
You look very handsome tonight, Miss Queenie
Handsome as Iâ€™ve ever seen
The brown matches your eyes
Oh, hush
Let's see here
Hambert's back in town
He came home legless, but he's home
I know you were sweet on him one time
Miss Simone messed herself
Oh, sweet Jesus
She got to stop doing that or it's diapers for her
Iâ€™ll be right there, Miss Jameson
Now, Queenie, now come on
Itâ€™s awful nice out here
Come on out back for a moment
Take your mind off things
You're so bad
What in God's name
What's this
Hope I didn't hurt it none stepping on it like that
We best leave that for the police
Iâ€™ll go
Itâ€™s for sure nobody wanted to keep it
Come on, baby
Where are you, Queenie
Hold your water
You go deal with it
Okay
Queenie, Apple, she went and messed herself all over again
Jane Childress, start her a bath
And mind your own business, Mrs. Duprey
Somebody stole my necklace
Okay
All right, Mrs. Hollister, Iâ€™ll be right with you, okay
Go on back upstairs, hear
You are as ugly as an old pot  but you're still a child of God
Queenie, Apple, she won't take a bath without you
Mercy
Iâ€™ll be right there
You just wait right here for me now, okay
My sister gave me those pearls
I can't find them anywhere
Somebody's been stealing my jewelry
See
Right around your pretty white neck
Hush all that noise
Is Dr. Rose still here
I don't know
Your heart is strong
I trust you ladies will help me out with that
I have something
Could you come downstairs
Never seen anything like it
Nearly blind from cataracts
His bones indicate severe arthritis
His skin has lost all elasticity, and his hands and feet are ossified
He's dying
His body is failing him before his life's begun
Where'd he come from
My sister's child
From Lafayette
The poor child, he got the worst of it
Come out white
There are places for unwanted babies like these, Queenie
No room for another mouth to feed here
The Nolan Foundation, despite their good intentions,  thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is


You said he don't have long
No, this baby, he is a miracle
That's for certain
Yâ€™all listen
Yâ€™all listen up here
We're gonna have us a visitor  that's gonna be staying with us for a little while
My sister had a child and she couldn't see right by it, so

He's known as


Benjamin
He's not a well child, so we're gonna have to take good care of him
I had 1 0 children
Let me see him
God in Heaven
He looks just like my exhusband
Look, he's prematurely old
Join the club
He's smiling
Hambert sends his remembrances to you
Are you right out of your mind
It may not even be humankind
Mr. Weathers, come back here
Please
It seemed I had found a home
Is any of this true
Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token
That clock just kept going,  year after year after year
But I didn't know I was a child
Same old crap every day
I thought I was like everyone else there
An old man in the twilight of his life
Could you make him stop that
Itâ€™s used for eating, not for playing with
And use your napkin, please, Mr. Benjamin
Hey, boy
Always had a healthy curiosity
What was up the street
Go get him
Benjamin
That is dangerous
Come back over here
Stay put, child
I loved her very much
She was my mother
Some days I feel different than the day before
Everybody feels different about themselves, one way or another
Just taking different roads to get there, that's all
You're on your own road, Benjamin
Mama
Just be thankful for what you're given, hear
You're already here longer than you're supposed to
Some nights, Iâ€™d have to sleep alone
I didn't mind
I would listen to the house breathing
All those people sleeping
It was a place of great routine
Every morning at 5:30, no matter the weather,  General Winslow, U. S. Army, Retired, would raise the flag
Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once an opera singer of some note,  well, she sang Wagner
All right, baby, come on
We got to put some life into these old sticks for you
Get you walking so you can help me out around here
Molasses
I learned to read when I was five
My grandfather was a dresser for a famous actor
He brung home every play for me to read
"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,  "Let dying Mortimer here rest himself
"Even like a man new haled from the rack,  "So fare my limbs with long imprisonment
You thought I was plain ignorant, didn't you
The actor my grandfather worked for was John Wilkes Booth
He killed Abraham Lincoln
On Saturday nights, Mama would make me go to church
Benjamin
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
What can I do for you, sister
Lord, if you could see clear to forgive this woman her sins  so she can bear the fruit of the womb
Out, damnable affliction
Praise God
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
And what's this old man's irrediction
He's got the Devil on his back,  trying to ride him into the grave before his time
Out, Zebuchar
Yes
Out, Beelzebub
Yes
Seven
God bless you
He's seven
Now, this is a man with optimism in his heart
All right
Belief in his soul
Yes
Yes
Yes
Hallelujah
We are gonna get you out of that chair
And we're gonna have you walk
Amen
In the name of God's glory

Rise up
Come on
Come on
Walk
Come on, son
Come on with it, son
Come on
Come on
Now God is gonna see you the rest of the way
He's gonna see this little old man walk without the use of a crutch or a cane




.and divine inspiration alone
Hey, Ben
Go, son
Now walk
Yes
Come on
Rise up, old man
Rise up like Lazarus
Hallelujah
Yes
Come on
Say hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Walk
Yes
Now when I look back on it, it was miraculous
But you know the saying, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away
Glory in the highest
Sweet Jesus
No
No
There were so many birthdays
So we wouldn't run out, we would spare the candles
Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays and I don't like cake
And death was a common visitor
People came and went
There was a silence in the house
It was a wonderful place to grow up
I was with people who had shed ail the inconsequences of earlier life
Left wondering about the weather, the temperature of a bath,  the light at the end of a day
For everyone that died, someone would come to take their place
My fifth wife and I are captured by a neighbor tribe of cannibals
Oh, goodness gracious
My wife, she can't swim, so, sadly, she eaten
Oh, my God
My second wife steps on cobra and dies
That's Mr. Oti
He's an acquaintance of an acquaintance of mine
The next summer Iâ€™m captured




.with three others by the Baschiele tribe
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer to a very strange American man
I hear you're not so old as you're looking
You just fooling everybody
Did you get Madjembe
Worms
I don't think I have worms
This is just how I am
Did you take your pills today
No, ma'am
Let's get a cold root beer
I found the medication under your pillow
Iâ€™m not supposed to
Itâ€™s dangerous
Come on, little man
Hello, children
Then Iâ€™m in the monkey house at Philadelphia Zoological Park
Three thousand people show up my first day
Look
What's it like living in a cage
But the monkeys
They do some tricks there
I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali
She is orangutan
When Iâ€™m not playing with the monkeys, they want me to run to the bars  in my cage, with my teeth
So then what'd you do
Then I leave zoo, go here, go there
You were all alone
Plenty of time youâ€™ll be alone
When you're different like us, it's gonna be that way
But Iâ€™ll tell you a little secret
Fat people, skinny people, tall people,  white people, they're just as alone as we are
It would be nice to sit by my river again
Come, I have an appointment
There's my little man
You ready, sugar
Always ready
Always ready
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin
Itâ€™s a pleasure to meet you, sir
You can find your own way home, can't you
Hey
Hey
Where in God's name have you been
Get in here
I mean, you take my breath away, you know that
It had been the best day of my life
How's her breathing
Itâ€™s shallow
They say itâ€™ll reach us in a few hours,  so I gotta get my baby and take him to my sister's
They say there's nothing to worry about here in the hospital
Are you okay
Yeah, Iâ€™m okay reading
I shouldn't be more than an hour
It was just Dorothy leaving
Go on, Caroline
"On Sundays, the families would come and visit.
It was Thanksgiving, 1 930
I met the person who changed my life forever
Well, Benjamin
Good day, Mrs. Fuller
What elixir have you been drinking
Thank you, ma'am
Grandma
Look at me
That was really something
Come on over here, you
Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy

Iâ€™m afraid, Benjamin, I don't rightly know your last name
Benjamin's fine
Good people, supper is served
For everything thy goodness sends
Amen
Amen
Amen
Did you know turkeys aren't really birds
They're in the pheasant family, can't hardly fly
Itâ€™s sad, don't you think
Birds that can't fly
I love birds that can't fly
They are so delicious
That's terrible
I have something to telic y'all  while we're giving thanks for God's blessings
The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers
What does she mean, answered her prayers
Thanks
She's gonna have a baby, silly
That's what my mama said when I was gonna have a baby brother,  but he didn't live long,  'cause he didn't breathe right
"You can see that it is 5:00,  "because Big God Nqong's clock says so.
Isn't that something
Again, read it again
Oh, read it again, please
All right
But afterwards, you must go to bed
I promise
Are you sleeping
Who's that
Oh, hi
'Kay, come on
Come on
Under here
Here, you light it
Iâ€™m not supposed to play with matches
Don't be a chicken
Iâ€™ll telic you a secret if youâ€™ll telic me one
Okay
I saw my mama kissing another man
Her face was red from it
Your turn
I thought so
You don't seem like an old person
Iâ€™m not
Are you sick
Well, I heard Mama and Tizzy whispering
They said I was gonna die soon, but maybe not
You're odd
May l
Okay
What are you doing under there
Itâ€™s after midnight
You are not to be playing together
Yes, ma'am
Now you get back to bed, little lady
And you ought to be ashamed of yourself
You are a different child
A manchild
And, baby, people aren't gonna understand just how different you are
What's wrong with me, Mama
Come here
Now go on to bed, hear
And behave yourself
Go on
Say your prayers, hear
Did I ever telic you Iâ€™ve been struck by lightning seven times
Once I was just crossing the road to get the mail
I never forgot her...  "

blue eyes.
Mom
Did you get that this Benjamin loved you from the first time that he saw you
Want me to go on
He crosses something out
When that baby came, things were different
Your mama gone away And your daddy gonna stay  Didn't leave nobody but the baby  Babies were born, people died
Iâ€™ve come to say goodbye
Iâ€™m going away
Going
I haven't figured that out yet,  but Iâ€™ll send you a postcard when I get there
What about your friend, the tall lady
We are not friends anymore
That's what happens with tall people sometimes
Well, goodbye
Spent a lot of time by myself that year
Hello
Hi
Welcome
We've been expecting you
Can you please show her up to Mrs. Rousseau's old room
Well, she's old as the hills
She's almost blind
She won't be a bother much longer
Well, all right, long as she stays from up underfoot
As hard as I try, I can't remember her name
Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford
Maybe it was Maple
Itâ€™s funny how sometimes the people we remember the least  make the greatest impression on us
And she always dressed in fine clothing, as if she was going out
She taught me to play the piano
Itâ€™s not about how well you play
Itâ€™s how you feel about what you're playing
Try this
You can't help putting yourself in the music
There were many changes
Some you could see, some you couldn't
Hair had started growing in all sorts of places,  along with other things
Darling, the pain
All right, Mom, Iâ€™ll get the nurse
This is a major hurricane,  a slow hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of...  Not doing too good
Nobody seems to know whether to stay or leave
Iâ€™m gonna ride it out
There
That should make things much easier
My father waited four hours for my brother to get here from Boger City
Couldn't go without him
She seems like a sweet woman
I haven't had as much time with her as I would've


I could use your help
Excuse me
Sure

.
...to Poverty Point to watch the boats go up and down the river
These were hard times
Did I ever telic you I was struck by lightning seven times
Once when I was in the field, just tending to my cows
My fourth hand didn't show up
What's the matter
He never pays
Nobody wants a job
I do
You got your sea legs about you, old man
I think
Get your ass on board
Weâ€™ll sure as hell find out
I was as happy as I could be
I need a volunteer
Yes, Captain
Scrape off all this bird shit
Right away, sir
And I was actually gonna be paid for something I would've done for free
His name was Captain Mike Clark
Get moving, then
Come here
Can you still get it up
The old pole, huh
The high, hard one
I guess
When was the last time you had a woman
Never
Not that I know of, sir
Wait a minute, now
You mean to say you've been on this earth however many years  and you've never had a woman
Damn, that's the saddest thing Iâ€™ve ever heard in my life
Never
No
What did your father do
I never met my father
You lucky bastard
Out on my father's boat, workin' the twoaday,  this little, fat bastard
Anyway, I finally work up the nerve and telic him,  "I don't want to spend the rest of my life on a goddamn tugboat.
You know what Iâ€™m saying
You don't want to spend the rest of your life on a tugboat
Absolutely
Damn right
So you know what my father says to me
"What the hell do you think you can do?
So I telic him
"Well, if you're asking,  "I want to be an artist.
He laughs
"An artist
"And that's exactly what you're gonna do.
Well, I turned myself into an artist
A tattoo artist
I put on every one of these myself
You have to skin me alive to take my art away from me now
That one
You gotta do what you're meant to do
And I happen to be a goddamned artist
But you're a tugboat captain
Captain Mike
We're ready for you and your friend
Let's go, old timer, eh
Break your cherry
Hey, Captain
Hi, Captain
Hi
Hi
He gives me the willies
That is not for me
It was a night to remember
What are you, Dick Tracy or something
Iâ€™ve got to rest
Again
No, thank you
You have a nice night
Will you be here tomorrow
Every night but Sunday
Good night, sweetie
Come back now
Things money can buy you
Can I offer you a ride somewhere
Well, that's awfully kind of you, sir
My name is Thomas, Thomas Button
Iâ€™m Benjamin
Benjamin
Itâ€™s a pleasure to know you
Would you like to stop somewhere and have a drink
Evening, Mr. Button
Whatâ€™ll it be, sir
Iâ€™ll have whatever he's having
With whiskey, not brandy
You don't drink, do you
Itâ€™s a night for firsts
How's that
Iâ€™ve never been to a brothel, either
It certainly is
True enough
Your drinks
I don't mean to be rude, but your hands
Is that painful
What kind of disease
I was born old
Iâ€™m sorry
No need to be
There's nothing wrong with old age
Iâ€™m so, so sorry
She died in childbirth
To mothers
What line of work you in, Mr. Button
Buttons
Button's Buttons
There isn't a button that we don't make
Would you gentlemen like anything else
One for the road, Benjamin
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button
So, what line of work do you do
Iâ€™m a tugboat man
I enjoyed drinking with you
Benjamin
Would you mind if, time to time, I stopped by and said hello
Good night, Mr. Button
Good night, Benjamin
Drive on
Where have you been
Nothing
I met some people and listened to some music
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy
Sneaks up on you
One person is there, then suddenly somebody else has taken her place
She wasn't all elbows and knees anymore
Benjamin
I loved those weekends when she'd come  and spend the night with her grandmother
Daisy
Daisy
You want to see something
You gotta keep it a secret, so get dressed
Iâ€™ll meet you out back
Come on
I can do anything you can do
We gotta hurry
Is he okay
Captain
Captain Mike
Morning, Captain
Can you take us out
Do you know what day it is
Do you know what that means
Means I was very drunk last night
Well, you're drunk every night
Close friend
I want to show her the river
You're not supposed to go joyriding with civilians
What are you waiting for
Pulled in for repair a wounded duck
She's flying now, huh
Ahoy, sailor
Did you say something, Mom
Itâ€™s getting really bad
Can you hear me, Mom
Time just seeped out of me
"Things were changing quickly.
What if I told you that I wasn't getting older,  but I was getting younger than everybody else
Well, I'd feel sorry for you,  to have to see everybody you love die before you do
Iâ€™d never thought about life or death that way before
Benjamin, we're meant to lose the people we love
How else would we know how important they are to us
And one fall day, a familiar visitor came knocking on our door
She taught me how to play the piano
Amen
Amen
And she taught me what it meant to miss somebody
Let's go
Iâ€™d had my first drink
Said goodbye to one friend and buried another
In 1 936, when I was coming to the end of the 1 7th year of my life,  I packed my bag, said goodbye
Bye, Benjamin
Goodbye
I knew, life being what it was, Iâ€™d probably never see them again
Good luck to you, son
I love you, Mama
I love you, too, baby
I want you to say your prayers every night, hear
Be safe, hear
Where you going
To sea
Iâ€™ll send you a postcard
From everywhere
Write me a postcard from everywhere
He sent me a postcard from everywhere he went
Every place he worked
Newfoundland
Baffin Bay
Glasgow
Narvik
He had gone with that Captain Mike
Captain Mike had contracted for three years  with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage
The old ship had been refitted with a diesel engine and a new sea winch
We went around Florida and up the Atlantic seaboard
Captain Mike and me
Cookie, Prentiss Mayes from Wilmington, Delaware
The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,  who got along fine at sea but, for some reason,  once they were on dry land couldn't stand the sight of each other
You know, one in every eight boats never returns
All hands lost at sea
From Belvedere, South Dakota
Never said a word to anyone, except himself
I wrote him constantly
I told him I had been invited to audition in New York City  for the School of American Ballet
Please stay
Thank you
Thank you
You can stay
Another dancing gypsy
How is it when you showed up  you were no bigger than a bollard with one foot in the grave,  but now, either I drink a hell of a lot more than I think I do,  or you sprouted
What's your secret
Well, Captain,  you do drink a lot
We stayed in a small hotel with a grand name, The Winter Palace
You have no idea what you're talking about
Its heart rate's 1 ,200 beats per minute
Its wings beat 80 times a second
lf you was to stop their wings from beating,  it would be dead in less than 1 0 seconds
This is no ordinary bird
This is a frickin' miracle
They slowed down their wings with moving pictures,  and you know what they saw
You know what the figure eight is the mathematical symbol for
Infinity
Infinity
Everybody, no matter what differences they had,  the languages, the color of their skin, had one thing in common
Three, please
Could you hold, dear, for us, please
Good evening
Her name was Elizabeth Abbott
She was plain as paper
But she was pretty as any picture to me
What are you looking at
lf you must know, we have a longstanding agreement  never to go to bed sober
Isn't that right, darling
Whatever you say, darling
Her husband was Walter Abbott
Darling
Oh, thank you, my darling
Oh, yes
I broke my heel off one of my shoes
Iâ€™m not in the habit of walking about in my stocking feet
They were long days there
One particular night, I was having trouble sleeping
Iâ€™m sorry
I couldn't sleep
I was gonna make some tea
Would you like some
Oh, no
Milk
Honey
I hope you like flies in your honey
Oh, perhaps not
Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little
Steep
Soak
I don't know, I mean, there's a proper way of making tea
Well, where Iâ€™m from, people just want it to be hot
Now, you're a seaman
A sailor
There's no age limit, as long as you can do the work
And you have trouble sleeping
Thank you
I didn't think I did
Something's been keeping me up
My father, in his 80s,  he was so convinced he was gonna die in his sleep,  he limited himself to having afternoon naps
He was so determined he was gonna cheat death
Did he
Did he what
He died sitting in his favorite chair  listening to his favorite program on the wireless
He must have known something
My husband's the British Trade Minister, and we've been here for 1 4 months
We were supposed to go to Peking  but it never seemed to work out
Have you been in the Far East
No
Iâ€™ve never been anywhere, really
I mean, outside of harbors
And where is it that you're from
Louisiana
I didn't know there was another
And she told me about all the places she had been, and what she had seen
Iâ€™m just a lush, myself
And we went back to our rooms, to our separate lives
But every night, we'd meet again in that lobby
A mouse running, and stopping
A radiator hissing
A curtain blowing
There's something peaceful, even comforting  knowing that the people you love are asleep in their beds  where nothing can harm them
Elizabeth and I would lose track of the night  until just before daybreak
I think I may have given you the wrong impression
Well, married women don't customarily sit around  in the middle of the night with strange men in hotels
I wouldn't know what a married woman does or doesn't do
Good night
"Iâ€™ve met somebody, and Iâ€™ve fallen in love.
Mom
That was over 60 years ago
Did you love him, Mother
Well

Iâ€™m not dressed
Oh, you look splendid, just as you are
Don't waste any time bothering about the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,  'cause they're really completely ordinary,  but the caviar and the vodka  are sublime and plentiful
So
And don't eat it all at once,  because that way, there's nothing left to enjoy
And now, take a little swallow of vodka while it's still in your mouth
You haven't been with many women, have you
Not on Sundays
No, ma'am
When I was 1 9,  I attempted to become the first woman ever to swim the English Channel
Really
I was in the water for 32 hours
And when I was two miles from Calais,  it started to rain
That's it
Steady on
When I couldn't go any further,  I stopped
I just stopped
And everybody asked me, would I try again
For why wouldn't l
As a matter of fact, Iâ€™ve never done anything with my life after that
Your hands are so coarse
I can feel the wind in your cheek
Iâ€™m afraid it's the witching hour
Itâ€™s something you never forget
You make me feel years younger, too
I wish I was
So many things Iâ€™d change
Iâ€™d undo all my mistakes
What mistakes
I kept waiting, you know
Thinking that Iâ€™d do something to change my circumstances
Such an awful waste
Wasted time
lf we're going to have an affair,  you're never to look at me during the day
And we're always to part before sunrise
And we will never say "I love you.
Are you cold
Iâ€™m freezing
Oh, you
You're frozen
What an idiot, Iâ€™m standing here in this fur
She was the first woman that ever loved me
You want me to skip some
No, Iâ€™m glad he had somebody to keep him warm
"I couldn't wait to see her again.
We saw each other every night
We always used the same room
Elizabeth
Good night
Until one night
Yesterday, December 7th, 1 941 ,  a date which will live in infamy...  Itâ€™s a meeting, a policy meeting regarding your future,  possibly beyond
As you may or may not know,  the Japs bombed Pearl Harbor yesterday
Frank D. Rooseveltâ€™s asked each of us to do our part
The Chelsea's been commissioned to serve in the United States Navy
To repair, to salvage, and to rescue
Anybody doesn't want to go to war, now is the time to say so
Yeah, Iâ€™ve been meaning to talk with you, Mike
My wife's doing poorly
Iâ€™d like to maybe see her one more time
You're free to make your way home any way you can, Mr. Mayes
Well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook
Food poisoning's one of the leading causes of death at sea
I can cook, Captain
Been doing it all my life
I don't know
You're a little moody for war, Benjamin
Iâ€™ll take any man wants to kick the shite out of the Japs and the Huns
That's it, pack your gear
She had left a note
She wrote, "It was nice to have met you.
And that was it
We would just tow crippled ships, scraps of metal, really
lf there was a war, we didn't see it
There was a man assigned to us
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy
But most of all, he loved America
There is no other country in the world
When you spell America

His family had been Americans for over 500 years
These pacifists
They say they won't fight on conscience
Now, where would be if everybody decided to act  according to their conscience
Keep it down, would you, Chief
Hey
You seem trustworthy
lf something happens to me,  could you see that this gets to my wife
He'd given me all of his pay
Hadn't spent a dime of it
I want my family to know I was thinking about them
Get your asses up here, you lazy bastards
The war had finally found us
Pleasant, man that light
A transport carrying 1 ,300 men had been split by a torpedo
We were first to arrive at the scene
Cut the engines
All stop
We were the only sound
Fellas
We sure as hell can't outrun them fuckers
Battle stations
What
Is that the last one
Captain
They shot the hell out of my painting
Youâ€™ll be all right, Captain
They got a nice spot in Heaven waiting for you
Nice spot
You can be as mad as a mad dog at the way things went
But when it comes to the end,  you have to let go
Captain
Thirteen hundred and twenty eight men died that day
I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis Smith
John Grimm, who was right, he was gonna die there
I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody,  and to Mike Clark, captain of the tugboat Chelsea
I said goodbye to all the other men who had dreams of their own,  ail the men who wanted to be insurance salesmen  or doctors or lawyers or lndian chiefs
This don't get fixed
Iâ€™d never seen a hummingbird that far out to sea
Before or since
And in May of 1 945, when I was 26 years old,  I came home
Iâ€™m ready
Iâ€™m coming
Iâ€™m ready
All right, Iâ€™m coming, Miss Alfalina
Queenie
Sweet Jesus
Oh, you're home
Oh, Lord, you came back
Let me look at you
Child, it's your brother, Benjamin
I didn't know he was my brother
There's a shitload of things you don't know, child
Get on out there and finish sweeping
Go on, now
Turn around
You look like you've been born again
Younger than the springtime
I knew it that moment I saw you, you were special
I telic you what, my knees are sore,  'cause Iâ€™ve been on them every night asking the Lord,  I said, "God, just bring him home safely.
Remember what I told you
"You never know what's coming for you?
That's right
Sit down
I sure saw some things
Oh, you seen some pain
Some joy, too
Sure, I did
Look at you
Where's Tizzy
Oh, baby
Mr. Weathers died in his sleep one night last April
Mama, Iâ€™m so sorry
Don't you worry about that, baby
They all just about new
Guess they're waiting their turn like everybody else, huh
Now, we're gonna have to find you a wife and a new job
That's right
Come on in here, help me with this table
Benjamin
She's stone deaf
Oh, and youâ€™ll be staying in what was Mrs. DeSeroux's old room
You're too big to be rooming with anybody else
Itâ€™s a funny thing about coming home
Did I ever telic you Iâ€™ve been struck by lightning seven times
Once when I was sitting in my truck, just minding my own business
You realize what's changed is you
And late one morning, not long after Iâ€™d been back..
Hey
Excuse me, is Queenie here
Daisy
Itâ€™s me, Benjamin
Benjamin
Oh, my God
Of course it's you
How are you
Itâ€™s been such a long time
When did you get back
Well, I got back a few weeks ago
I spoke to Queenie, she said you were in the war, somewhere at sea
We were so, so worried about you
Oh, Iâ€™m okay
Well, look at you
You're so lovely
And a woman had taken her place
"She was the most beautiful woman Iâ€™d ever seen.
Beautiful
"The most beautiful.
You remember Grandma Fuller
Why, sure I do
She passed
Iâ€™m sorry
I just can't believe we're both here
Must be fate
No, no, what do they call it
Kismet
I don't believe l. 
He says that everything is predetermined,  but I like to think of it as fate
Iâ€™m not sure how it works, but Iâ€™m glad it happened
Have you been to Manhattan
Itâ€™s right across the river from me
Now, I can see the Empire State Building  if I stand on my bed
Where have you been
Tell me everything
Last time you wrote, you said you'd been to Russia
Iâ€™ve always wanted to go to Russia
Twice as cold
My goodness
We always said you were different
You wrote that you met somebody
Did it work out
It ran its course
Hey, do you remember this
"This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo  "at 5:00 in the afternoon.
Would you like to have dinner
Did I telic you that I danced for Balanchine
He said that I had perfect line
And he just..
He just put it right into the production
I mean, can you imagine that
Like in a..
In a classical ballet
You know, a dancer, intentionally falling
There's a whole new word for dance now
No, he's not the only one, though
There's Lincoln Kirstein and Lucia Chase, and oh, my...  Oh, there's Agnes de Mille
Itâ€™s not about the formality of the dance, it's about what the dancer's feeling
As she told me about this big new world,  names that didn't mean a thing to me,  I didn't really hear very much of what she was saying
Itâ€™s new and it's modern and it's American
They understand our vigor and our physicality
Iâ€™ve just been talking and talking
No, no, Iâ€™ve enjoyed listening
I didn't know you smoked
Iâ€™m old enough
Iâ€™m old enough for a lot of things
In New York, we stay up all night,  watch the sun come up over the warehouses
I have to go back tomorrow
So soon
Wish I could stay
Dancers don't need costumes or scenery anymore
Lawrence
Well


His books were banned
The words are like making love
Sex is a part of it
You know, a lot of the dancers are lesbians
There was one woman who wanted to sleep with me
Does that upset you
Somebody wanting to sleep with me
You're a desirable woman
I would think most of them would want to sleep with you
Let's go back to the house
Or we could get a room somewhere
I don't know, Daisy
Itâ€™s not that I wouldn't like to or anything
I think Iâ€™ll just disappoint you
Oh, Benjamin, Iâ€™ve been with older men
You should be with your friends
You're only young once
Oh, Iâ€™m old enough
Daisy, just not tonight, is all
We could go hear some music
You look so handsome and so distinguished
They're saying the hurricane's gonna miss us, blow right on by
Oh, that's great
Iâ€™ll stay under the blankets with Mother
She says nothing

Benjamin
"Things were becoming different

...for me
My hair had very little gray and grew like weeds
My sense of smell was keener
My hearing, more acute
I could walk further and faster
Come in
Benjamin
Do you remember me
Well, sure I do, Mr. Button
What happened to you
Got infected, so


Welcome home, my friend
I see you're still drinking your Sazerac with whiskey
You still visiting the house on Bourbon Street
Not for a long time
Interesting times, though
We went from making 40,000 to nearly half a million buttons a day
We were operating around the clock
Damn shame
The war has been kind to the button industry
I don't know how much longer I have
No


I don't have any people
I keep to myself
I hope you don't mind, but, whenever possible,  Iâ€™d enjoy your company
Iâ€™ll certainly do what I can
Now, Button's Buttons has been in our family for 1 24 years
My grandfather was a tailor, and he had a small shop in Richmond
So, with his help, the tailor shop grew to this
And today, I can't sew a stitch
That's very, very interesting
You sure have done well for yourself
Benjamin
You're my son
Iâ€™m so sorry I never told you before
You were born the night the Great War ended
I thought you were a monster
I promised your mother Iâ€™d make sure you were safe
I should never have abandoned you
My mother
At the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain
When I was a boy, Iâ€™d love to wake up before anyone else,  run down to that lake and watch the day begin
I fell in love the first time I saw her
Your mother's name was Caroline Murphy
She worked in your grandfather's kitchen
She's from Dublin
In 1 903, Caroline and all her brothers and sisters came to live here,  in New Orleans
Happiest day of my life
The day I married your mother
Why didn't you just telic me
I plan on leaving everything I have to you
I have to go
Where
Home
He thinks he can just show up  and everything's supposed to be fine and dandy
Well, he got another thing coming, that's for sure
God be my witness, he got another thing coming
He left us $1 8 that night you was found
Eighteen ratty dollars  and a filthy diaper
Good night, baby
Did I ever telic you I was struck by lightning seven times
Once, I was walking my dog down the road
Iâ€™m blind in the one eye, can't hardly hear,  get twitches and shakes out of nowhere, always losing my line of thought
God keeps reminding me Iâ€™m lucky to be alive
Storm's coming
May I help you, sir
Up the stairs, first bedroom
Wake up
Let's get you dressed
Now that's something
Thank you
You can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went
You can swear and curse the Fates
But when it comes to the end,  you have to let go
Well, it sure is a beautiful service
My baby
Now, Iâ€™d never seen New York
Excuse me, Iâ€™m a friend of Daisy's
Right this way
Daisy has company
Daisy
Daisy
Yes
Is somebody looking for me
Benjamin
What are you doing here
Thought Iâ€™d come visit
Spend some time with you, if I could
You took me by surprise
You can just throw them out
No
I couldn't take my eyes off of you
I thought you were mesmerizing
Thank you
That's very kind of you to say
A group of us are going to a party
Would you want to come
Someone told me about a restaurant  I thought you might enjoy
I made a reservation, just in case
Just, all the dancers go out after the show
You're

You're welcome to come with us
Iâ€™ll get changed
All right
She choreographs for the Ballets Russes
You were breathtaking
Sweetie
This is David
He dances with the company
Who
I told you about him
Oh, yeah
How you doing
Iâ€™ll go get you a drink
Thanks
So, you were a friend of her grandmother's
Or something like that
Something like that
Come on
Hey
Now, I had no idea you were coming
What did you expect
What, you want me to drop everything
Now, this is my life
Babe
Come on
There's lots of musicians, interesting people
You don't have to do that
This is my fault
I should've called
I thought Iâ€™d come here  and sweep you off your feet or something
Daisy
Come on
Let's go
Seems nice
Do you love him
Iâ€™m happy for you
Maybe Iâ€™ll see you at home
Okay
I enjoyed the show
You couldn't have known
I was 23. l. 
I just didn't care
What did you do next
Some photographs, I think, in the front of my bag
I was as good a dancer as I was ever gonna be

I danced everywhere
London, Vienna, Prague
Iâ€™ve never seen these
Mom
Well, I was the only American  to be invited to dance with the Bolshoi, sugar
It was glorious
But Benjamin was never far from my thoughts
"Good night, Daisy.
He said that
"Life wasn't all that complicated
"If you want, you might say I was looking for something.
Benjamin
Mrs. La Tourneau just passed
That'd be me
Thank you
Miss Daisy Fuller
Just a minute
Please have a seat
Sure
Whether it's by accident or by design, there's not a thing we can do about it
A woman in Paris was on her way to go shopping
When she had gotten her coat, the phone had rung
So she had stopped to answer it and talked for a couple of minutes
While the woman was on the phone,  Daisy was rehearsing for a performance at the Paris Opera House
And while she was rehearsing, the woman, off the phone now,  had gone outside to get a taxi
Now, a taxi driver had dropped off a fare earlier,  and had stopped to get a cup of coffee
And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing
The taxi had to stop for a man crossing the street,  who had left for work five minutes later than he normally did  because he forgot to set his alarm
While that man, late for work, was crossing the street,  Daisy had finished rehearsing and was taking a shower
And while Daisy was showering,  the taxi was waiting outside a boutique for the woman to pick up a package  which hadn't been wrapped yet,  because the girl who was supposed to wrap it  had broken up with her boyfriend the night before and forgot
When the package was wrapped, the woman, who was back in the cab,  was blocked by a delivery truck
The delivery truck pulled away, and the taxi was able to move  while Daisy, the last to be dressed,  waited for one of her friends who had broken a shoelace
While the taxi was stopped, waiting for a traffic light,  Daisy and her friend came out the back of the theater
And if only one thing had happened differently,  if that shoelace hadn't broken  or that delivery truck had moved moments earlier  or that package had been wrapped and ready  because the girl hadn't broken up with her boyfriend,  or that man had set his alarm and got up five minutes earlier  or that taxi driver hadn't stopped for a cup of coffee  or that woman had remembered her coat and got into an earlier cab,  Daisy and her friend would have crossed the street  and the taxi would have driven by
But, life being what it is,  a series of intersecting lives and incidents  out of anyone's control,  that taxi did not go by,  and that driver was momentarily distracted
And that taxi hit Daisy
Daisy
Help
Daisy
Who told you
Your friend wired me
Very kind of you to come all this way to see that I was all right
My God
Look at you
You're perfect
I wish you hadn't come here
Her leg had been broken in five places
And with therapy and time, she might walk again
But she'd never dance
Iâ€™m gonna take you home with me
I want to look after you
Then Iâ€™ll stay here in Paris
Don't you understand
I don't want your help
I know Iâ€™m feeling sorry for myself, but I don't want to be with you
You don't listen
You might change your mind
Just stay out of my life
I was awfully cruel
He didn't understand
"I didn't leave right away
"I stayed in Paris for a while to look out for her.
I never knew that
I taught myself to walk again
I took the train to Lourdes
Let's take a look
That's normal
Pulse rate is slowing
Will you be all right
Yeah
All right, he says, "I went back home.
And then there's a lot of pages torn out
"I listened to the sound of the house.
He


He spilt something on it, so it's hard to read, Mom
Something about sailing, does that make sense
I learned to sail an old boat of my father's from the lake house
Or maybe three
Don't know why you bother, Sam, just gonna be there again tomorrow
Mama
And in the spring of 1 962,  she came back
You want to know where Iâ€™ve been
No
Just disappearing like that
It was something I needed to do for myself
Yeah, well, I never took you to be the selfish type
I sure hope Iâ€™m not wrong
Iâ€™m usually not wrong about people
Good night, baby
You haven't said two words
I don't want to ruin it
Sleep with me
Absolutely
I asked her to come away with me
I am so glad we didn't find one another when I was 26
Why do you say that
I was so young
And you were so old
It happened when it was supposed to happen
I will enjoy each and every moment I have with you
I bet I can stay out here longer than you
Barely a line or a crease
Every day I have more wrinkles
Itâ€™s not fair
I love your wrinkles
What's it like growing younger
I can't really say
Iâ€™m always looking out my own eyes
Will you still love me when I have acne
When I wet the bed
When Iâ€™m afraid of what's under the stairs
What
What are you thinking
Some things last
Good night, Daisy
Good night, Benjamin
Mom
When did you meet Dad
Some time after that
Did you telic him about this Benjamin
He knew enough, darling
Queenie
Hello
Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin
Oh, Benjamin
Queenie died
Iâ€™m so sorry
Iâ€™m so sorry for your loss
She was a great woman
We buried her beside her beloved Mr. Weathers
It is a wonderful old place, darling
I think we are going to be so happy here
Oh, what a long family history you have
They come with the house
Come on
We bought ourselves a duplex
I loved that house
It smelled like firewood
Don't

Don't stop, darling
"It was one of the happiest times of my life.
We would have picnics in the living room
We ate when we felt like it
Stayed up all night when we wanted
We vowed never to fall into routine,  to go to bed or wake up at the same time
We lived on that mattress
Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam, was a physical therapist
We lived four blocks from a public pool
So, even if nothing ever happened,  you'd still be right here where you are now
They put too much chlorine in here
I promise you Iâ€™ll never lose myself to selfpity again
And I think right there and then  she realized none of us is perfect forever
She found peace
She opened a studio and taught young girls how to dance
And tendu
And spot, spot, spot
Excellent
Good night, Miss Daisy
You certainly are beautiful to watch
Dancing's all about the line
Sooner or later, you lose that line, and you never get it back
I figure, you were born in 1 91 8, 49 years ago
Iâ€™m 43
We are almost the same age
We're meeting in the middle
Wait
I want to remember us just as we are now
Iâ€™m pregnant
You know, I swear the nurse slipped and said it was a boy
But I think it's a girl
I know you're afraid
Iâ€™m not hiding it
What's your worst fear
Baby born like me
Okay
How can I be a father when Iâ€™m heading in the other direction
Itâ€™s not fair to a child
I don't want to be anybody's burden
Sugar, we all end up in diapers
I want this, and I want it with you
I want you to have everything you want, all of it
Iâ€™m just not sure how to reconcile this
Would you telic a blind man he couldn't have children
Youâ€™ll be a father for as long as you can
I know the consequences
Iâ€™ve accepted that
Loving you is worth everything to me
The oldest woman to ever swim the English Channel  arrived here today in Calais...  Keep it
The 68yearold Elizabeth Abbott arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time,  exhausted but happy
Miss Abbott, how would you sum up, in words, this achievement
I suppose..
Anything's possible
All right
Yes
Thank you
Thank you very much
Thank you
Yeah
You're very kind
In the spring, on a day like any other...  Iâ€™ll be back in an hour
Honey
Go and call an ambulance
The baby's coming
The baby's coming
271 4 Napoleon
There you go
Keep breathing
Deep breaths
There we go
She's a perfectly healthy baby girl
Honey
She gave birth to a five pound, four ounce baby girl
Did you count the toes
She's perfect
"And we named her for my mother, Caroline.
This Benjamin was my father
Excuse me
Hey, I know it's hard
You can't smoke in here
Nobody can telic you exactly where it's gonna hit,  but we have to go with the guidance that we have,  incorporate that information and then pass it along to you
"You grew as the doctor had promised, normal and healthy.
You're gonna have to find a real father for her
She's gonna need someone to grow old with
Sheâ€™ll learn to accept whatever happens
She loves you
Honey, she needs a father, not a playmate
Of course not
Is my age beginning to bother you
Of course not
Is that what you're telling me
You can't raise the both of us
We had a party for you
How are you
Hey, man
Before you turn around, theyâ€™ll be in high school, dating
I sold the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain,  I sold Button's Buttons,  I sold my father's sailboat, put it all into a savings account
And so that you and your mother might have a life,  I left, before you could ever remember me
I don't want to read this now
Can you just telic me where he went
I don't really know
Itâ€™s for me
1 970
I was two
"I wish I could have kissed you good night.
They're all for me
"I wish I could have taken you to your first day of school.
Six
"I wish I could have been there to teach you to play piano.
1 981 , 1 3
"I wish I could have told you not to chase some boy
"I wish I could have held you when you had a broken heart
Nothing I ever did will replace that.
I guess he went to India
"For what it's worth, it's never too late,  "or, in my case, too early
.
...or, in my case, too early,  to be whoever you want to be
There's no time limit
Start whenever you want
You can change or stay the same
We can make the best or the worst of it
And I hope you make the best of it
I hope you see things that startle you
I hope you meet people with a different point of view
I hope you live a life you're proud of
"

.start all over again.
He had been gone a long time
Iâ€™ll see you next Thursday
Good night, Miss Daisy
Oh, good night, sweetheart
Can I help you
Are you here to pick somebody up
Mom
You ready yet
Mom, what's wrong
I was just hearing a very sad story about a mutual friend  who I hadn't seen for a very long time
Caroline, this is Benjamin
Hi
Hi
Hey
Oh, Iâ€™m sorry, I thought you were done
Benjamin Button, this is my husband, Robert
How do you do
A pleasure
Well, it was very nice to meet you
Weâ€™ll be in the car, darling
All right
Wow
She's beautiful
Like her mother
Does she dance
Not very well
I guess that'd be from my side of things
She's a dear, sweet girl
She seems a little lost
A lot of her reminds me of you
My husband, he's a widower, or was

Was a widower
He's been a terrific father
Good
You are so much younger
Only on the outside
You were right
I couldn't have been raising both of you
Iâ€™m not that strong
What are you gonna do
Iâ€™m staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel on the Avenue
I don't know what Iâ€™m gonna do
But

They're waiting
That was him
The hurricane has changed directions
Itâ€™s going to make landfall sometime soon
Am I supposed to do something
Arrangements are being made  to move people, but it's up to you
No
No, we're

Iâ€™ll let you know if anything changes
"That night, while I was sitting and wondering why I came back at all,  "there was a knock at the door.
Come in
Are you all right
Iâ€™m sorry, I don't know what Iâ€™m doing here
I have never stopped loving you
Oh, but, Benjamin, Iâ€™m an old woman now
...so few people even know  that you were ever in jail in the first place
Iâ€™ll telic you, I am sick about it, too,  because, please, if they're not gonna give you an award  like "Man of the Year," at least what they could do  is stop having you listed as an exconvict  which I think is, again, so unfair
Good night, Benjamin
Good night, Daisy
And as I knew I would, I watched her go
That's the last thing he wrote
Hello
Yes, speaking
Iâ€™m sorry, I don't understand
Itâ€™s the corner house
Iâ€™m Daisy Fuller
Iâ€™m David Hernandez,  with the Orleans Parish Department of Child Welfare Services
He was living in a condemned building
The police found this with him
This address
Itâ€™s got your name in it a lot
He doesn't seem to know who or where he is
He's very confused
I was telling Mr. Hernandez that Benjamin is one of us
lf he needs a place to stay, it's all right, he can stay here
You play beautifully
He doesn't seem to like to be touched
He goes in and out of states of recognition
The doctors say, if they didn't know any better,  he has the beginnings of dementia
Do you remember me
Iâ€™m Daisy
Iâ€™m Benjamin
Itâ€™s nice to meet you, Benjamin
I would love to hear you play
Do I know you
I want some breakfast
No, I didn't
You just finished eating
Don't think I don't know what you're doing
He doesn't believe he just had his breakfast
Now, why don't we see  if we can't find something else for you to do
Well, like what, sugar
Itâ€™s like there's this whole life I had,  and I can't remember what it was
Itâ€™s okay
Itâ€™s okay to forget things
There he is, he's up there on the roof
It wasn't easy
Benjamin
I can see everything
I can see the big river
That's right,  you can see everything, sweetheart
I can see the graveyard where Mama's buried,  and all those other people
What if I could fly
I knew a man who could fly
You come down and Iâ€™ll telic you all about him
Somebody go up there
Nearly the same age I was when I had met him
"This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo  "at 5:00 in the afternoon  "when he had got his beautiful hind legs.
The days passed
And I watched as he forgot how to walk  and how to talk
Iâ€™m Daisy
Can you say "Daisy"
In 2002, they put up a new clock in that train station
And in the spring of 2003,  he looked at me  and I knew that he knew who I was
I wish Iâ€™d known him
Now you do
Mom, I think I should go see what's going on
Good night, Benjamin
It occurred in the Ninth Ward
Some people are born to sit by a river
Some get struck by lightning
Some have an ear for music
Some swim
Some know buttons
Some know Shakespeare

Oh, happy birthday, sir

I don't like her
I wouldn't even mention the following, but he was very insistent
It's obviously some sort of prank
What
Well, a gentleman called requesting to have lunch with you
I tried to assure him that you were very busy... What's his name
I'm sorry
Cancel my lunch
Make a reservation at the City Club for myself and Mr. Butts

Happy birthday, Nickie

Oh, really
In college
Which college
Miss me
As much as that's possible
So do you
To think I was worried
Worried about me
How long has it been since Mom's funeral
Two, three years
I did
It didn't take
Well, you can't smoke here
It's illegal to smoke in restaurants in California
Fuck California
How are you
Couldn't be better
Elizabeth
We're divorced
Lives in, uh, Sausalito
I liked her
And what about you
What, you don't keep track of me anymore
Not since family week at rehab
So what brings you to town, Conrad
Everything all right
Need anything
Nope
No I don't need anything from you
I just  found myself laying naked on the beach near Ibiza,  and all of a sudden it clicked
October 12th
October 11th
Whatever
This is for you
You shouldn't have
What do you get for the man who has everything
Well, I do have golf clubs
Call that number
Why
It'll make your life fun
Fun
You've seen other people have it
It's an entertainment service
An escort service
A profound life experience
Sorry
I'll just...  No, that's all right
I said I would
No, you didn't
You still on medication
Why would you say that
I'm not on anything
I'm not even seeing a shrink
And I feel great
Do you mind
I think you'll like this
I did
I'll call them
Do it
For you
All right, I'll call
It's just that, uh, I hate surprises
I know
Happy birthday to you  Happy birthday, Mr. Van Orton  Happy birthday to you  Thank you
Have you seen the profitability report
You can imagine how much more unhappy I am
So, you're gonna deal with Anson
That's correct
Sleep well, Nicholas
I will
Good night, Ilsa
Dinner's in the oven
Thank you
Oh, I saw Conrad today
Did you
I think he's in one of those  personal improvement cults or something
Well, send my love if you see him again
Happy birthday
Goodnight
Aw
The FCC expects to receive more than $500 million in bids  as the licenses eagerly soar...  Elizabeth, good evening
Happy birthday, Nickie
1140
You almost missed it this year
Does Rose Kennedy have a black dress
I went, not once, but twice through the spanking machine
I can only imagine
How are you
Connie asked me the same thing today
Really
I've always liked your brother
Anyway..
I..
I just thought  this might be difficult for you...  Just another birthday
That's right
He was 48, wasn't he
I hadn't really thought about it until now
I honestly don't know
Please send Dr. Mel and Rachel my best
She has a little brother on the way
Official nuclear family
You must be very pleased
We are
We are very pleased
I guess I should let you go
Take care of yourself
You too, Nicholas
I mean that
I really do
Uhhuh
Be well
A proposal to encourage small businesses to provide their employees  with health insurance is now being debated by Washington legislators
However, Democratic lawmakers are voicing serious concerns  about the bill, claiming that it would undermine local efforts..
I just wanna make sure that we understand each other
Once you get it down on paper then you can count on my full support
We understand that
Thank you
We'll talk soon
I do feel that it reflects negatively on me
I received this... Just a moment
I'm sorry you feel that way
I understand
We hope we haven't caused you any inconvenience
Thank you for choosing CRS
Mr. Feingold, could you assist this gentleman
Oh, yeah
Sure
My brother sent me this card...  Oh, here we go
Yeah
... as a gift
All right, excellent
Well, let's get started
Yeah, I'm sorry about the... You know, all this hullabaloo here
We're, uh... Well, we're still moving
You mind holding that
Thank you very much
Thank you
Are you hungry
No, thank you
Next to Chinatown
A gift from Conrad Van Orton
Interesting
Well, your brother was a client with our London branch
We do a sort of informal scoring,  and his numbers are outstanding
Really
Hmm
No, thank you
Okay, fine
Now, you need to fill out these forms
There's an application  and then a couple of psychtests there
Oh, uh, for the financial questionnaire,  don't answer anything you don't feel like
"I sometimes hurt small animals, true or false"
"I feel guilty when I masturbate. 
Well, I don't write the questions
I just review the answers
Well, to give us an overall sense of your capability...  No, what is this for
What are you selling
Oh
It's a game
A game
Specifically tailored for each participant
Think of it as a great vacation
What... What kind of vacation
It's different every time
Humor me with specifics
And what if nothing is lacking
May I make two suggestions
Second, you don't have to decide today
Take the silly test, fill out the stupid forms
One day, your game begins
You either love it or hate it
Decide then
You know we... We are like  an experiential bookofthemonth club
That was my sales pitch
How long will this take
About an hour for those, another hour for the physical
Physical
You'll be out of here in no time
Confused
Risky
Bloody
Whoops
Cancel it
Push it back till Wednesday
And Anson Baer called about tomorrow
Tomorrow
Yes, that's correct
Shouldn't be long
You said that two hours ago
All right
Put it back until tomorrow
Selection before the following emotional responses
You have 0.9 seconds to enter your emotional response
Reaction time is a factor
You have 0.9 seconds to enter your emotional response
I'm sorry to keep you waiting
Oh, don't worry
It's been just terrific spending my entire day  with your crack team
Well, it's all down to this
This is an insurance company requirement
Our guarantee, payment's entirely  at your brother's discretion as a gift
It's dependent on your satisfaction
Does that mean that if I'm not happy he doesn't have to pay
That's never happened
I think you mean, dissatisfied
That's right
You're a leftbrained word fetishist
Initials, initials, and sign there  in blood
Just kidding
All right
Now, your copy will be at the front desk in this folder
What about Monday or Tuesday
No, that's bad for me
Well, how about tonight
Well, I'm working all this evening
Wednesday is the only possibility right now
Do you wanna do dinner
Okay
Really
What did you think
Well they seemed just a little bit disorganized
Well, when I did it in London they'd been around a while
No, I haven't decided yet
Telling you, it's like getting in on the ground floor of the next Disneyland
CRS won't go public
They're familyowned
Stranger things have happened
They opened here
The game in San Francisco
They're doing fine without any of us
Nicholas
How are you
James, good evening
Good evening, sir
We have new members here
Put their next round on me
Got you, sir
No, no, no, no
Last time I played Pebble I swore I'd never pick up another club again
Well, the reason I mention it is I took the test today at the Montgomery Street office
You did
Kudos
So, yours hasn't started yet
That was one of the questions I had for you
What is it
Oh, what is it
You know, I envy you
I wish I could go back and do it for the first time all over again
Here's to new experiences
Good night, Ted
Nicholas
Nice to meet you
So, you played recently
I was working in Los Angeles
Oh, I hear the London office is very good, too..
It sounds like a lot of fantasy, roleplaying nonsense, though
You wanna know what it is
John chapter 0 verse 25
I, um,  haven't been to Sunday school in a long time
"Whereas once I was blind,  "now I can see. 
Good night, Nicholas
Best of luck
If the BaerGrant meeting  is not held tomorrow  may as well not be held at all
So you will miss another opera you would have slept during anyway
We now have an opportunity to show our clients  how well we will rise to his exhilarating challenge
Yes
Nicholas Van Orton
Who is this
This is Cynthia from CRS
We've finished processing your application
Look, I'm in a meeting right now
I'm afraid it was rejected
I beg your pardon
You shouldn't feel this reflects negatively on you
We hope we haven't caused you any inconvenience
Anything wrong
Uh, no
No, nothing's...  You may hang up or press pound for more options
Oh, this is Conrad
Yes, Connie, it's Nicholas
Give me a ring when you get in
Oh, uh, regarding your birthday present,  um, things are a little crazy right now
I don't really know if I can fit it in my schedule
But we'll talk about it at dinner tomorrow
Thanks, bye
Hello
...the resulting rise of unemployment and decline  into buyable small businesses
No one has expressed an opinion as to how it will impact  the pampered existence of Nicholas Van Orton
The one thing on which both Democrats and Republicans seem to agree  is that most Americans harbor serious doubts about the economic future
A recent poll suggests a staggering 57% of American workers believe  there is a very real chance they will be unemployed within the next 5 to 7 years
But what does that matter to a bloated millionaire fat cat like you
I..
I don't..
It's frustrating for me if you don't pay attention
What is this
This is your game, Nicholas, and welcome to it
I'm here to let you in on a few ground rules
You received the very first key, and others will follow
So keep your eyes open
How do you... You can see me
How does this work
There's a tiny camera looking at you right now
It's impossible
You're right, impossible
You're having a conversation with your television
It's miniaturized
Mr. Van Orton
And in domestic news,  in Southern California..
Yes, Ilsa
What is it
It's fine
It's...  ...in the petroleum processing plant yesterday
Will you be needing anything else
No, I won't, Ilsa
Thank you
Good night, then
...in a petroleum processing plant yesterday
Several workers were injured in the... Who was that
Never mind who that is
You wanna know how a camera got into your home, don't you
Yes, I would

Figuring that out is the object of the game
...regret to have the American ambassador expelled after the incident
US State Department responded quickly with a formal apology
An announcement of the ambassador's immediate voluntary removal...  Hey, buddy, spare any change
Huh
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
May I help you
What is it
What
Thank you
Buddy
Can you help me out
I ran out
Just... Just go into the next stall
Hello
Hello
Didn't expect to see you here
Been up all night
I checked it
Personally
I appreciate that, Sam
Why don't you go home and get some sleep
You're sure you don't want me along
Hmm, nice shirt
Don't ask
Ciao
You promised to meet the projections, Anson
$1.60 a share is what you said
I don't think this visit comes as a surprise
Projections were far too optimistic
Our EPS was 150 last quarter
We're up 6 cents..
The expectations were 10, and in this case the expectations meant everything
My stock is falling
I don't know about yours
Those pennies are costing millions
If you still feel this way, vote your shares...  Today is what counts, Anson
You...  You intractable son of a bitch
If your father could see you now
What
Your father was a friend
A friend
God damn it
I've watched you grow up
I will tell you..
I'm not finished
Now, you misspoke before when you said you're stepping down
I am firing you
Confidence is restored
The stock goes up
No
Where's Stewart Grant
He's probably out there sailing  enjoying his golden years wondering where the hell you are, Anson
I'm sorry
You failed
I have prepared a severance package that is more than  equitable
If I leave without your signature,  this agreement begins to disintegrate
Benefits shrink, options narrow  and your compensation will be shriveled
I think it's in your  best interest, Anson, to...  Well, I guess this is your  lucky day
My lawyers will be in touch with you
Has Conrad Van Orton left a message
I'll check on it right away, Mr. Van Orton
Thank you
Oh, I'm so sorry
Here
Please, don't do that
I'm so sorry
I'm really having a bad day
How about a bad month
You did almost exactly the same thing to me when I was here last week
Here
Don't do that
I don't think so
It was an accident, sir
Terrific
I said I was sorry
Christine
Mr. Van Orton is a valued customer
Fine
Then you kiss his ass
Don't you talk to me like that
I apologized,  I offered to help
Clean out your locker
What
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Van Orton
If you're not too uncomfortable,  will this table suit you for a complimentary meal
It'll be fine
I'll fetch your waiter
Thank you
Check, sir
Pardon me, miss
Oh, great
It's you
I don't know how this works, but do you have something for me
I received this note...  What're you babbling about, psycho
I need to know what is going on
You wanna know what's going on
I'm going on my second job this month
Maybe I should try to explain...  Don't explain, just fuck off
Son of a bitch
I am..
I'm trying to..
I...  Jesus, what is this
What's with him
He fell down
Can you hear me
Do you know what to do
I don't even know if he's breathing
Here you are
Move your head
Don't stand there
Hey, hey
It's okay
We're gonna get help
How do we know he's real
He's pissed his pants, mister
He's turning blue
Police
Police
You will have to fill these forms out
I don't know this man
Here, what do you need
Can't get involved in this shit
Hey, I might have to detain you
The report's gotta be filled out
She can do the reports
Ride with your wife
We'll meet at the hospital
Two blocks away
She's not my wife
Let's go
10 minutes ago, I'm about to enjoy a quiet little dinner
I received this note..
He's breathing, isn't he
Is the siren entirely necessary
Let's just talk to someone who can get this over with, shall we
They need your driver's license number
Oh, no
You've got to be kidding
What is happening
This was what I was trying to explain to you
This is a...  A game
A what
They plan elaborate pranks
Things like this
I don't really understand it myself
What are you talking about
The lights, they went out
A hundred people ran away
What, so you mean the guy who just pissed himself and turned blue was..
Sorry about that
You should be
There's gotta be a...  A flashlight
Oh, great
I thought that guy was going to die
I'll see you around
How do you know that's the way
I don't
Where did you all go, you motherfucking frat boys
Lobby
My brother got me this gift certificate to this company...  Why, I got the key out of this...  Out of the mouth of this  wooden clown
I can't take this
There's no signal
What is the going rate for a trappedinelevator adventure
Well, don't even think about it
Read what the sign says
"Warning, do not attempt to open if the elevator stops
"Use emergency... "  Phone
"... phone. 
If there was one
Okay, I'll give you a boost
You get up, you go first
This is not an attempt to be gallant
If I don't lift you how are you going to get up there
I don't know, you'll pull me up
It's easier my way
No
Oh, please
Okay
There I said it
Okay
We can use this like a ladder
My hero, let's go
I don't think so
Damn it
My briefcase
Not as if anybody could open it
Wait a minute
This is CRS
What's CRS
The one that gave me the gift certificate
This is their building
We'll wait
We'll wait for security to come  and we'll just explain
Explain for both of us
Wait
We don't wanna draw any attention...  Just out for a stroll
Run
We can't fit down there
Hey
You're a grown man
I'm not responsible for..
I'm not the one who started running
Well I'm not the one that started this...  Get up there
Climb
So, where's your modesty around attack dogs
Hey
Shut up
Let me guess
I go first
There goes a thousand dollars
Your shoes cost a thousand dollars
That one did
Here
Come on
Okay
What
There should be a fire escape
Yeah, it's classic
Why me
Who are you
Nicholas Van Orton
What are you, a czar or something
All right
I think not
Be careful
Oh...  Shit
Table for two, please
Where're we going
That tall bright building
It's right near there
Everything okay, miss
San Francisco's finest
Is there some place I could throw this
There's a wastebasket beside the desk
Oh
Think I have a fresh sweatshirt for you somewhere
You know, you've never even asked me my name
The maitre d' said your name was Christine
Oh, right
I guess I'll call you a cab
You got a shower in your office
Yeah
You an athlete or something
I move money from one place to another
Actually, would you mind if I just quickly rinsed off
No
Yeah, it's behind the door
Oh, I'll just be a second
No problem
Listen, I know the owner of the City Club and I'd be happy  to give him a call if you'd like
Don't, it was a shitty job anyway
I, uh..
I have a confession to make
Someone gave me 400 bucks to spill drinks on you as a practical joke
And what did they say
Well they said 300
I said 4
They said, "The guy in the gray flannel suit. 
Mr. Van Orton
Thank you
Hello
Mr. Van Orton, it's Maria
I thought I should call
What time is it
I took the liberty of rescheduling your meeting with Alison and...  No, no, no
I'll be in there in an hour
Can you..
Could you check with Lost and Found, please
Anson Baer's in town at the Ritz Carlton
Really
He's requesting dinner tonight
Well, we'll see about that
You left it there last night
Should I send someone
No, just give me the number
I'll call you back
Good morning, Hotel Nikko
Yes, this is Nicholas Van Orton
I'm told you have my American Express card
The concierges has arranged for the wine and flowers in the room
Has he
And a young woman phoned  to say she's on route but running a little late
Did the young woman leave her name
I'm sure I don't know
Of course you don't
Thank you
Sorry, my fault
Welcome back
Have we met
I believe so
If you'll just sign here on the signature card
Thank you
My key
Huh
Don't I get a key
Cute, that's very cute
This way, sir
Have a nice day
Housekeeping
Could you come back a little later
Ah
Shit
Where the fuck is he
Jesus
Why are you following me
I'm not following you
I'm just driving it
Hey,  whatever I'm doing is none of your business
Is that what this is all about
Look buddy, back off
Just back off, huh
What
Oh, that's cute
I suppose the game uses real bullets, huh
All right
I'm a private investigator
Somebody hired me to keep tabs on you
Who
Who hired you
Have him meet me at the Ritz Carlton
I'm on my way
What's happening
Follow me, Sam
Ah, Nicholas
It's unexpected
Now, do you really believe  that just because you publish children's books  people are gonna care about my reputation
You can have pictures of me  wearing nipple rings, buttfucking Captain Kangaroo
And whether that stock is up or down
Daddy
It's all right
And the fact that you bring Conrad into this juvenile game  is unconscionable
Are you finished
No
I'd like you to meet my attorney, Samuel Sutherland
I think the two of you have got something to talk about
Oh, we met this morning
I signed the termination contract for BaerGrant
I accepted your settlement, Nicholas
I'm going sailing
You're welcome to join our lunch
Maybe we can straighten this out
You remember my wife, Mary Carol, and my daughterinlaw, Kaleigh
Please  accept my  misguided, uh...  How concerned should I be
It looks a lot like you
Well, you should see what they do with the nightly news
What
Can I ask you to do me a favor
You know you can
Find out about a company called Consumer Recreation Services
Sounds like they make tennis rackets
Wait a minute
They gave me a waiver
What is this
It's a...  What's..
It's invisible ink
You're joking
I'm being toyed with  by a bunch of depraved children
This...  Are you okay
Tell me not to worry
You don't have to worry
I promise
I'll call you later
Right
Okay, bye
What's the company that we use
United
What
United Taxi Company
United Taxi Company
Call United, find out who the driver was  and where they took her
Ilsa
You fuckers
Ilsa
Ilsa
Ilsa
Mr. Van Orton
What do you mean
What's happened
The house, you haven't seen the house
What's wrong
Now, lock your door
Stay inside, just lock your door
Oh, be careful
Yes, I need the police
There's been a break in to my house
Just stay on the line and give me your address
My address is 2210 Broadway
It's the biggest house on the street
Yes
Yes, there's been a break in
Are you sure they're gone
What
Nickie
Hello, sir
Are you still there
Hello
Sir
All right
What happened
Shh
Conrad, where're we going
What are you doing
They're methodical
If I can't trust the room service in the hotel,  I sure as hell can't trust a fucking car
Who
Who do you think
Jesus
When I think what I almost got you into...  What are you saying
Oh, I'm so fucked
They just fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you
All right, calm down
Just take a breath
They won't stop, Nick
I paid the bill
I gave them their fucking money
Everything
I'm a goddamned human piñata
Calm down
And why do they keep playing if you've already paid
I don't know
I don't know
They did this
It's a flat tire
How do you know
Get a grip on yourself, will you
Okay, okay
The phone doesn't work
Really
You know how to change a tire
No, don't you
It can't be that hard
I don't think we should be out in the open like this
It's in the glove compartment
You're with them
What
You're doing this
You're part of it
I don't know about those
Somebody put them in the car
What are you talking about
You brought them to me
These were in your car
They're right there in your fucking car
Conrad
Listen to what you're saying
No
You're not gonna control this conversation
Because you resent me
Stop being emotional
Lower your voice, Conrad
What
You're afraid somebody's gonna witness the scene
Get back in your... Get back in your fucking house
Will you stop it
You're just so afraid that somebody's gonna see  what a manipulative fucking control freak you are
What is wrong with you
What are you on
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick
Ah, bullshit
I'm not you
I'll never be you
There you go again
I'm your brother
For Christ's sakes, I'm your brother
All I ever tried to do was help you
I don't want your help
Nobody asked you to play dad
You don't say that
Did I have a choice
Jackass
Conrad
What
I don't want your help
Did I have a choice
Did I have a choice
2210 Broadway
Hey buddy, you missed the turn
Hey
Did you hear me
You missed the turn back...  No, no, no
Stop the car
Stop the car
Thank you
Open, the goddamn door
Listen
I am a very wealthy man
And whatever they're paying you  I'll double it
Oh, Jesus Christ
No
What, are you out of your fucking mind
It's a game
Here they are
Detective, I'm Sam Sutherland
Tim Foley
You know where we're going
14th floor
Okay
The county recorder has no listing for a Consumer  Recreation Service or any derivation thereof
The divers, they're still looking for the cab
As soon as they find it they'll pull the plates and the VIN
Have you spoken to your brother
He hasn't called me back yet
What about the house
The graffiti was an oilbased marine marking solution,  illegal in the States
It's not impossible to trace but it'll take time
The photo, the gun,  the clown, the ambulance
Breaking and entering we've got solid
Malicious mischief, vandalism, harassment
But that's all
Reckless endangerment
Attempted murder
Except you said you hired these guys
That's irrelevant
It's our job to tell you what we've got
So far, we don't have motive
Why do you ask
I don't know
All the time I've known you you've never once asked about him
I guess he was just on my mind
Your mother loved your father very much
I think he just worked too hard
Was he, uh,  morose
I mean...  What I remember most  was that his manner was so  slight
No, what I mean is,  before he...  What happened
No
Nobody expected it
I wonder how much of him there is in me
Was Mother worried about him
Nobody ever worried about your father
It's Maria
I found the address you wanted from United Taxi
Yeah, give it to me
It's on Potrero Hill...  Who are you
Christine, is she here
She's sleeping
Hey
What're you doing here
Sure
Hi
Didn't think I'd ever see you again
What can you tell me about these
Is this you
Where did you get them
My hotel room
Are you telling me that this is not you
What makes you, um..
Think this is me
The bra
The red bra
Okay
Well, I thought that...  Can I sit down for a minute
Sure
Are you all right
You're not all right, are you
I'm sorry, I am being a nuisance
I should go
No, it's okay
I'll put some clothes on
I'll be right back
Do you have an aspirin
Can I get you something to drink with this
Is this you
Oh, yeah
Show it to me
Take the picture out of the frame  and show it to me
All right
They're watching
Not here
They can see here
Smoke detector
What do you say, uh...  Let's go for a drive or something
We could...  No, no, no
I am tired of this
I am goddamn tired of this
There's a...  Who do you people think you are
Who do you think you are
Nicholas, please
Let's go, right now
Come on
Just, come on out of there right now
Now you've done it
Get away from the window
What the...  What is this
Wake up, it's a fucking con
Get in, get in
You all right
Hold on
I could've handed you to them
You don't have a choice
No one else's gonna tell you what's going on
You wanna know
'Cause if I'm gone you never will
I can't believe they didn't even take the time to get the fucking house right
Who are they
Nobody does
Then what good are you
I know things like who you can trust  and that your brother was in it from beginning... That's a lie
Yeah
I was your waitress on your birthday
Connie told you about CRS that day
Ever seen me in there before
I mean, it wasn't his fault
I guess he thought it was his only way out
They fleeced him real good
How did they get to him
What are you talking about
Have you checked your accounts
That night in your office I got the number to your private line and modem  that gave CRS remote access to your computer
What
You took their tests, handwriting, voice samples, psych info
They used it all to figure out your passwords
And Feingold, the guy who signed you up,  he did 5 years for hacking Citibank
They only had to keep you distracted  while they broke into your financial network,  transferred your holdings into dummy accounts...  Overseas operator, please
Why else were they willing to shoot at us
Because they're finished with you
Live or dead's the same
Long as you disappear
Yeah
Yes
Bluetwobackslash0600
"D" as in David
That's right
The balance
They already got it, Nicholas
You've reached the Sutherlands
Please leave a message
As you get this message, Sam, I have checked them all
I don't know how,  but they have drained my accounts
Now you call the cops
I got one of them right here
We'll make her testify
I know how this sounds,  but you call me  on my cellular
And you be careful
They cut your card in half so...  My treat
You take two sugars, right
My name's not Christine
It's..
I mean, it's not my real name
Who fucking cares
It is just money
I'd rather not talk about it right now
All I mean is someone like you...  How many times have you done this
I'm curious
What
These scams
Lots
But, whatever nickeldime bullshit you pulled in the past,  this is more than just me
This is pension plans,  payrolls
This is $600 million
Nick, it's Sam
I got your message
So, what are we gonna do
I've been on the phone for an hour already
Nicholas, your funds are intact
Nothing's been touched
What are you talking about
I checked on them myself
I made the calls
Nothing's changed
I'm telling you
Not one cent is unaccounted for
Who is it
He's in on it
I don't know what the hell is happening, but stay where you are  until I get there
Nicholas, I have another call
Give me your precise location
Nicholas
We've got to get out of here
How did they get to him
Why did..
I wouldn't worry about it
It's out of your hands
Cellular calls can be intercepted
Those calls you made to B of A, France
You were talking to us
Access codes,  passwords, access codes, passwords...  Stuff even your lawyer didn't have
Stuff even your lawyer didn't have
We have it now so we're done
Bye, Nicholas
Things have happened  and it's important that... Shh, shh, shh
No money, no identification, no passport
What happened to you
Where to begin..
It always is
I was on holiday alone  and I was robbed by two men
Robbed
And what hotel were you staying at
I don't remember
I...  Have you gone to the police
And I just need enough to get out of here
Oh, we'll help with the local law enforcement if you wanted to bother
You say you were mugged
And they didn't take that watch
How much is a watch like that worth
A couple of hundred at least
Man with a watch like that doesn't necessarily have a passport problem
Can I have your attention, please
Thank you
Anybody here going to San Francisco
I've got $18 and 70...  78 cents  for a ride to San Francisco
Anybody
Keep the change
Thanks, pal
Conrad Van Orton
One moment, please
Is there a problem
You're here for Conrad Van Orton
Yes
I'm the hotel manager
Pleasure to meet you
Where's my brother
Wait a minute, is there trouble
Sir, this is a private matter for you
There was some complaints by other guests, damage to his room
His behavior
Yes, sir
There was an incident a few days ago
The police took him
They left this address in case anyone came
It's a hospital in Napa, sir
I'm terribly sorry
Elizabeth, I need to borrow your car
Nickie,  what happened to you
Look at me
I don't know
I..
There're just some things I have to do, all right
Of course, you can have it if you need it
Can't I get you something to eat
You know that you're the only person  that I can trust
Everyone else is..
If Sam Sutherland calls you,  you don't tell him you talked to me
You lie to him
Okay, coffee,  English muffin,  and your water
This bottle  is open
Who opened this bottle
I don't want an opened bottle
I want an unopened bottle
I don't want ice in the glass
I want just a glass,  please
Nickie, talk to me
You're scaring me
I don't even know what you're saying
I don't mean it
You know, I've been thinking the last couple of days
I've had some spare time
And I wanted to tell you that  I understand why you left me
And I know that I resented it
I want to apologize to you  for shutting you out  and not being there
And I hope that you can forgive me
You're tired
Then,  pain sets in
The onset of a migraine headache
If this sounds all too familiar, relief is here at last
Oh no, you bastards
For nearly a decade, doctors have been prescribing...  How did you find me here
Taggarene is strong medicine for headaches, toothaches, muscle fatigue, joint pains..
He's an actor
So if you trust your doctor, trust Taggarene
He's an actor on television
Can't explain now
Can I borrow your Yellow Pages
Get out of the car, fucker
You're making a mistake here
Get the fuck out of the car
I am extremely fragile  right now
New Moon Cafe
He does commercials
Do you know how many customers we have
Hundreds, thousands
I know he ordered from you
He's an actor
He's like one of these people you have here up on your...  Hey
Why are you taking my picture
We were hoping he could audition today
Oh, this will break his heart
Well is there any place we can contact him
Well, his beeper's here on the table
He took the kids to the zoo
The zoo
That's very, very sweet
Which zoo
Oh, it's the one with the white tiger
Okay, please
I got my kids
Get rid of them
All right, guys, uh, guys
More snacks
Here, go, go, go
That's all
Uh..
It was just a job
Nothing personal
You know
I mean, I play my part,  improvise a little
I need to talk to who's in charge
Nobody knows
I mean nobody gets a big picture...  Hey, Tammy, Alex cut it out
Your offices are empty
I need to find out where they are
Look,  they own the whole building
They just move from floor to floor
You can get me in
No, I can't
Oh, yes, you can
You can tell them the police called
You tell them I'm gonna blow the whistle on them
What whistle
There's no fucking whistle
This is very dangerous
I don't think that you understand
Michael, guys
Well we're here
Drive in
What're you gonna do, anyway
You won't get your money back
I don't care about money
I'm pulling back the curtain
I wanna meet the wizard
Pull in somewhere where they won't see you
Shit
Stay down
You're not allowed to be here
They called me back
I got a fitting
He's with me
You don't need me
Get in
Oh, my God
What floor
You're fucked, you both
They're gonna miss me
Where
It was a different floor then
Then guess
I..
It went on this way, sort of..
All right, take it easy
It's gonna be a surprise
Oh, fuck
Back from the dead
Nicholas, you're not about to shoot anyone
Turn around
You're gonna come with me
Everybody down
Stop
You tell me
Who's behind this
Who did this to me
What do you mean, "Why?
How deluded can you be
Who is responsible for this
It wasn't you
It wasn't personal
It could've been any asshole with a couple of hundred million in the bank
You get your boss up here
You tell them I'm gonna shoot somebody
They won't do it
Oh, yes, they will
You get somebody up here  because I'm gonna kill you
They don't care about me, Nicholas
You're not in a position to threaten anyone
Wait a minute
Where'd you get that
That gun
That's not an automatic
What the fuck are you talking about
Where did you get the gun
This is my gun
But we searched the house
Well I guess you missed this, didn't you
There's a situation up here
It's a part of your game
Don't you start with me now
No, no, listen to me
Don't you fucking start with me
I'm telling you the truth now
This is all the game
Bullshit, all right
I know what happened to that guy
What did you see
Think about it
What'd you see
I saw them kill him
Special effects, squibs
Squibs like in the movies
Nicholas
Nicholas, listen
I've got a real gun with real goddamned bullets..
Okay, okay
I'll put it down
He's on the other side of that door
He's an actor
No one's trying to kill you, Nicholas
Please put that gun down
You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life
Nicholas, there was always a safety net
The taxi, there was a diver
It's not true
It is
It's what you hired us for
Nicholas
Please, goddamn it
Conrad
Conrad's there
It's your birthday party
You stop lying
He's got a gun
Get back from the door
You shot him
Someone..
He's dead
We thought you knew
How did you let this get so out of hand
He wouldn't listen to me
We went through this over and over
The mark is your responsibility
I'm sorry
He could have almost killed us
I had a walkietalkie
I used the walkietalkie
We're going to jail
Oh, God
Nicholas
We've got him
He's in the bag
He came in right on target
Keep everyone back until we clear away the breakaway glass
It's just breakaway glass, but it can still cut you
Just gonna take a look at you
I'm gonna check your pulse
That was quite a fall
Happy birthday, Nickie
What is this
It's your birthday present
I had to do something
You were becoming such an asshole
Ladies and gentlemen
Amazing
I just wanted to tell you
Great job
This was the best ever
Because if you didn't,  I was supposed to throw you off
Thanks
We have to head home
We just wanted to say goodbye
Rachel
I'm sorry about your car
I..
I think I left it at the zoo
No problem
Happy birthday, Nicholas
I really will
Nicholas, I haven't a clue what this is all about
Your taste in champagne is excellent as always
Yes, and I want you to know that what happened on Sunday was...  Oh, no, no, please
I've never been happier in my whole life
I thank you
And my wife thanks you
Thank you for coming
Thank you, Sam
What's this
The bill
Keep the pen
Thank you, both
Oh, God, yes, please
I'll take you up on that
Thank you, Connie
What happened to that  waitress
What was her name, uh...  Christine
She said something about catching a plane
I just saw her out front trying to hail a cab
I, um..
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
Thank you
No
It's  Claire
So you catching a plane or...  Yeah, we have a gig starting next week in Australia, so...  Gonna shear some more sheep
Just a walkon this time
Well, when you get back,  maybe, you know, we could have some dinner
No, I don't
So you tell me
Well, what... Where you're from
Originally,  Oklahoma
Colorado
I've been doing this for way too long
What kind is it
I don't know
White
<i>And the frame?</i>   Dark
<i>Same as last time.</i>  And no note
<i>No.</i>  <i>I'm so sorry, Henrik.</i>  Will you appeal
The media event of the year
Don't try to play it down, Mikael
It won't work
Don't try to play it up
That won't work either
Mikael, will you appeal
Yes
I'll appeal to you, Viggo
<i>Up until today, Mr. Blomkvist was able to play the victim...</i>  <i>...the brave journalist going up against the bad guy.</i>  <i>I don't know why malicious intent couldn't be proven.</i>  <i> When you call a guy a criminal  If you want to say these things</i>  <i>Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity.</i>  <i>There's really no greater disgrace for a journalist than libel.</i>  <i> Was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel.</i>  Can I get that sandwich there
And a black coffee
<i>In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed...</i>  <i>Wennerström, founder and president of the Wennerström Group...</i>  <i>...used state funds intended for industrial development in Poland...</i>  <i>...in an arms deal with the rightwing Ustase in Croatia.</i>  <i>I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist
Yeah
Where have you been
Thinking
Smoking
Yeah
TV4 called
I told them no statement...  ...until we've read the judgment in its entirety
Well, I have
Anyone else
Everyone who wants to see you humiliated
Been on the phone all morning
You are
You wrote it
I read it
I ran it
Our credibility isn't dead yet
Mine is
I'm tired
I'm gonna go home, crawl under the duvet for a week
Thank you
It's possible we could wait forever
You called her and spoke to her
<i>No one here particularly likes her.</i>  I find it's much better if she works from home
But you told her I wanted to meet with her
I've told her many times I prefer her not to meet clients
<i> You like her
Very much.</i>  <i>She's one of the best investigators I have, as you saw from her report.</i>   But
She's different
In what way
In every way
<i>Miss Salander is here.</i>  Lisbeth
Mr. Dirch Frode
Something wrong with the report
But I'm also interested in what's not in it
There's nothing not in it
Your opinion of him isn't
I'm not paid to give my opinion
So you don't have one
He's clean, in my opinion
He's who he presents himself to be
In his business, that's an asset
Well, there's less in his asset column after his conviction today
He made a fool of himself
If it happened that way
That was never part of my assignment
But you're right
He did make a fool of himself professionally
How much of a fool did he make of himself financially
The judgment will just about empty his savings
May I go
Your report is light in another area
His personal life
Nothing that warranted inclusion
Does that mean yes or no
I think what Miss Salander means, and I agree, is that everyone has a right...  ...to a certain amount of privacy, even if they're being investigated
Not in this case
I need to know anything about him..
He's had a longstanding sexual relationship...  ...with his coeditor of the magazine
It wrecked his marriage but not hers
Sometimes he performs cunnilingus
Not often enough, in my opinion
No, you're right not to include that
I know
You needed your sister
She offered
He declined
Never a good idea
Mixing family and business
I would've lost anyway
It wasn't about Mikael
It was about Wennerström sending a message...  ...to the press and the FSA, saying, "Don't ask questions.
Cheer up
Nilla, you don't have to worry about me
Mom's worried
About the money
Good evening
Nilla
What are you doing
Nothing
I don't wanna talk about it since I know you won't approve
Of...
Nilla
Light of Life
Hello
Herr Blomkvist
<i> Yeah
I represent Henrik Vanger
Perhaps you've heard of him
<i>He'd love to talk to you about a private matter.</i>  This is an awkward moment
<i>Oh, I'm sorry
I'm about to sit down to a Christmas dinner myself.</i>  No, that's not exactly what I meant
You're referring to your recent legal problems
That has provided us with much amusement
I'm sorry
<i>Herr Vanger has little love for Herr Wennerström either.</i>   Have him call me
But he would love to speak to you...  ...in person, if possible
<i> In Hedestad
That's not gonna be possible.</i>  <i>Herr Blomkvist, he's far too old to go to Stockholm
Please.</i>  Be so kind as to consider
<i>Hedestad is lovely in the winter.</i>  I'll call you back on this number
I'm sorry
What are you doing
I'm writing a press release
Saying
You're taking over as publisher, you're very sorry...  ...for any nuisance Mr. Wennerström was caused...  ...and I can't be reached for comment
Are you giving up
This makes me sick
First time in Hedestad
And the last
Oh, don't say that
You said it would be lovely in the winter
Well, this is unseasonable
Well, I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm
I'm joking  You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish
Welcome
Come inside
It's warm
How do you do
You used to run one of the largest industrial firms in the country
"Used to.
That's correct
Should I stay
No
My grandfather forged the tracks...  ...that the 4:30 train will take you home on
We stitched this country together
We made the steel, milled the lumber that built modern Sweden
And what do you think our most profitable product now is
Fertilizer
But I am with the settling of accounts
And the clock is ticking
I need your help
I'm Doing what
But what you'll really be doing...  ...is solving a mystery by doing what you do so well
Your recent legal mishap notwithstanding
My family
Would you like to sit
Did you make it
Have you something for me
I am on welfare, I do not administer it
This is not enough
No, thank you
<i>This is Harriet.</i>  The granddaughter of my brother Richard
Richard was a Nazi of the first order...  ...joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17
Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word "freedom"
Yes, I know
Okay
Missed all the real excitement
But not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife, Margareta...  ...and their son, Gottfried
Now, Gottfried, Harriet's father...  ...was what they used to call a goodtime Charlie
Do they
Okay
He was a charmer, a ladies' man and a drunk
In other words, a born salesman
Which he did for the company...  ...traveling around and taking clients out to dinner
Well, somebody's gotta do it
That's right
Drowned, drunk, here on the island
Martin, who runs Vanger Industries, now that I'm retired
That's right, I Googled him
And Harriet
She was bright, curious...  ...a winning combination in any person
And beautiful
Something happened to her
Someone in the family murdered Harriet...  ...and for the past 40 years...  ...has been trying to drive me insane
<i>It was September 24th, 1966.</i>  A Saturday
Harriet was 16
My brothers...  <i>...and their wives and their children and grandchildren...</i>  <i>...were all gathered here...</i>  <i>...for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner.</i>  <i>It was also the day the yacht club held their autumn parade.</i>  <i>Harriet, with one or two school friends, went into town to see it.</i>  She returned a little after 2:00
She asked if she could talk to me.</i>  I honestly don't remember what I was doing...  ...that I thought was more important...  <i>...but I told her to give me a few minutes.</i>  It was during those few minutes that something else occurred
<i>The accident had nothing to do with Harriet...</i>  ...and yet everything
<i>It was chaos as everybody put down what they were doing.</i>  <i>Police, ambulance, fire brigade...</i>  <i>...reporters, photographers, onlookers all quickly arrived from town...</i>  <i>...just as we on the island, the family, hurried to the bridge from our side.</i>  <i>The driver of the car...</i>  ...a man named Aronsson...  <i>...was pinned and severely injured.</i>  <i>We tried desperately to pry him loose with our hands...</i>  <i>...since metal tools might spark.</i>  <i>It was an hour after the crash that Harriet was in the kitchen.</i>  Anna herself saw her
<i>Well, we finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital.</i>  <i>Just as we from our side...</i>  <i>...slowly drifted back to the house.</i>  <i>The sun was down, the excitement over.</i>  <i>We sat down to dinner.</i>  <i>It was then that I noticed...</i>  <i>...Harriet wasn't there.</i>  <i>And she wasn't there the next morning.</i>  <i>Or the next.</i>  Or the next 40 years
<i>What was she going to tell me?</i>  Why didn't I make time for her
And she couldn't have just run away
No
Not without being seen
Believe me, I checked
She couldn't have just fallen and drowned
No
The currents aren't strong here
Like her father
Oh, no
Someone killed her
Someone on the island that day
Someone close enough to know...  ...what she used to give me each year on my birthday
Those are from her
And the rest, from her killer
Who knows about these
There's me, the police, the killer...  ...and now you
I understand your frustration...  ...but what you're asking me to do, it's a waste of money
But we haven't discussed your fee
Thank you
I can't find something you've been unable to find in 40 years
You don't know that
Here's what I propose:  You come stay on the island
I have a nice little cottage by the water you can use
You study the material I send you
You find something I've missed or you don't
As for compensation, I'll pay you double your salary...  ...for as many months as it takes
Quadruple it if you solve the mystery
Herr Vanger  I'm not done
I will throw in one more thing...  ...even though you're a terrible negotiator
It's something you want more than anything else...  ...and it can't be bought at any price
So let me give it to you
HansErik Wennerström
You were right about him
You just couldn't prove it
We're in the middle of the worst crisis ever, and you're writing a memoir
I need something to do
You fired you
I need you here, not the North Pole
Mikael, you know what this is going to look like
Like I've been gutted
I am
Wennerström wants to see me wave a white flag, not a red flag
If it looks like there's a problem between us, it'll satisfy him
He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down
You're leaving me to fight him alone
It's not the North Pole
Hey, he)'  <i>Network busy
Please try again later.</i>  <i>Network busy
Please try again later.</i>  What
Some milk
Please try again later.</i>  Oh, yeah
These as well
You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter
He doesn't have a daughter
Please
<i>He's had severe cerebral hemorrhaging...</i>  <i>...either from the fall itself or from a stroke that led to the fall.</i>  <i>His blood pressure is still high.</i>  <i>I'm hopeful he'll regain consciousness, but that's not assured.</i>  <i>And it's possible, even if he does...</i>  <i>...that there will be neurological damage.</i>  Oh, jeez
Hi
I'm Gunnar
Oh, hey, Gunnar
Come in
Okay
You want to put it in there
Okay
You're an author
That's unfortunate
Bit of trouble, I guess
No jail time though
That's good
No
There
The entire island is owned by my family
Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald...  ...another Nazi, if you can believe
Two in the family
But you'll probably never see him
He's a recluse
He was there that day
Indeed, he was
His daughter, Cecilia, lives over there
Does anybody speak to anybody on this island
Actually, Isabella, Harriet's mother, who lives there...  ...she speaks to Harald, which is one of the reasons I don't speak to her
Right
Cecilia's brother, Birger, lives over there
Who doesn't he speak to
But you wouldn't want him to
He can be just as unpleasant as Harald
Quickly losing track of who's who here
Soon you will know us all only too well
With my apologies
Now, out there, my grandnephew Martin's house, Harriet's brother
Who speaks to him
I speak to him
He runs the company now, as I think I told you
Gunnar, probably
Oh, yes, I met him earlier
He was 19 when Harriet disappeared
Well, he lives over there
Sorry
Your house
Oh, yes
The man who hires the detective...  ...should always be kept on the suspects list
Her mother
But what about the search
Please
I beg you
<i>The fact that I never found a body was not surprising.</i>  <i>You can't dig up an entire island.</i>  But neither could I find the motive
Was it spontaneous
Was it calculated
Was it about business
Business
Well, she was 16
And very bright
Henrik told me and many others he could easily see her...  ...running the company one day
She told them she was feeling unwell
But they also told me she kept secrets from them too
The main thing I learned was that teenage girls are complicated
I have one
Then you know
I wanted to...  ...ask you about this
I've studied it more times than I can say
I know every page of it
It's the last page I was curious about
As was I
It's a list of names, numbers and it must have some significance
All local phone numbers
The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosmarie Larsson...  ...an elderly woman who died some years before
The other three were not connected in any way that I could find
I reminded you of things you'd rather forget, and I'm sorry
I can't forget
I don't know what that is
Every policeman has at least one unsolved case to obsess over
Year after year, he kept going back to this Rebecka case
Taking out the files, studying them over and over
We were young
We laughed at him
And that was also a missinggirl case
No, no, no, that's not why I mention it
<i>Poor old Torstensson never solved it.</i>  <i>And he never let it go.</i>  So how's Mr. Palmgren doing
I heard he had a stroke of some kind
It's terrible
Now, what exactly do you do at this security company
But not fulltime
Not even parttime consistently
They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August
How much do you make there
How much is your rent
I Pay my rent
Never
You think that thing through your eyebrow makes you attractive
There's a discrepancy between the obligation...  ...of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances
There's no discrepancy
It was clear I could manage my own finances
That is not clear to me
I'm not a child
You are not
But you were
And between then and now, you were committed...  ...to the locked ward of St. Stefan's where you continued...  ...to display violent aggression
And it's not even that long ago
You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking that you have changed...  ...but when I'm looking at this...  ...not to mention the way you're looking at me now..
...I don't think you have
So the good old Mr. Palmgren days are over
You'll provide me with receipts for your expenses
If the numbers don't balance, I assume the difference is going to drugs
I've taken care of myself since I was 10
Miss Salander, please, look at me, this is important
Since your behavior is elaborately documented in here...  ...it will shock no one if I chose an alternative...  ...to the very lenient arrangement I have just outlined
Would you prefer institutionalization
Mikael
Yes
Oh, hi
We're going to the same place
Hop in
I found him at death's door, halfway up the hill
I'm afraid I'm a little out of shape
It's a climb for anyone
I should've warned you
Come in
Henrik says great things about you
Leave your shoes on
Martin
Smells wonderful
What a place
Look at that view
I used to work in the company's petrochemical division in Göteborg
When it was sold, I went with it
I live in Hong Kong, but come back to Stockholm for family events
And I drive up to spend a couple of days with Martin
It's just the moose steak she wants
Who can blame her
It's wonderful
Something's left open
No, no, it's fine
You're writing a book now, Martin said
Henrik's biography
I love Henrik
He's fascinating
Martin too
Yes, they are
You know about Harriet, right
Yes, I do
The family doesn't want to talk about it, but it can't be swept under the rug
Harriet
We can talk about it later
We can talk about it now
Liv knows everything about my crazy family
That's why she'll never marry me
I don't want to read about that in the book
Everything else is fine
Harriet certainly
You know, everything changed after that
How so
We're not Ericsson or Nordea
But we're still the largest familyowned company in the country
We have half of that now
And that downward slide began after my sister's death
It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit...  ...and his heart
You were here that day
I came in later...  ...after the accident on the bridge, with the 4:30 train
A terrible day
And the days after, you know
Searching, not finding
Even worse
This event, Mikael, it has to have a big part in your book
I got a call from social welfare
I've been assigned a new guardian
Hello
I thought I'd come over and say hello
I'm Cecilia
Please, come in
Can I get you some coffee
No, thank you
It's not about the family
It's about Henrik and the company
Like I said
It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone
Unlike the one that landed you in court
Unlike that one, yes
I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but, no, that's by no means my focus
Those boxes that Gunnar carted down here...  ...which are where, in the closet now
I wonder sometimes who's crazier, my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle
Since we're talking about her...  ...since you brought her up, what was she like
What was Harriet like
I'm sure Henrik has told you
He was my age back then
You were the same age
My sister Anita was closer to her in age
She knew Harriet better than anyone
You should talk to her
I'd love to
If I had to guess, London
You don't know where your sister lives
I haven't seen her in years
I'm getting used to that comment
She left
Moved to London, that was it
You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit
I'll track her down for you
You're backed up, aren't you
Hard drive at home, yeah
Okay
That's good, because this one's done
<i>Have you ever had any sexually transmitted diseases?</i>  <i>And when was the last time that you were tested for HIV?</i>  <i>How many partners have you had in the last month?</i>  And how many of those were men
It's regulation, I have to ask these things
Write what you want
And why do you need such an expensive computer
For work
Making coffee, sorting mail
I should have control of my money
Once you learn to be sociable, get along with people
Why don't we start with that now, huh
Why don't we start with me
You do something for me, I do something for you
That's what normal people do
I want you to have that computer
Feel that
That's gabardine
And...  And..
I like the reticence
<i>Anita Vanger.</i>   Through there
Thank you
Excuse me
I probably should have made an appointment
No, it's fine
Thank you
Mikael
Mikael
How do you do
So you're looking for investment counseling
Well, I would be if I had any money
I'm sorry, I don't understand
I'm writing a biography of your Uncle Henrik
That's why I'm here
I haven't seen him in over 20 years
Haven't seen my sister, haven't seen anyone in that family
Most of what I'm writing about predates that...  ...so your recollections are valid
I wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question
Well, then let me narrow it down
Harriet
Everything that I know about that I told to whatever his name was
Morell
My recollections were a lot better then
I just want to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like
She was very messed up
Well, just like all us Vanger kids, really, but...  Crazy mother
At least her father wasn't a Nazi
Was he abusive
Mine
No, hers
Some days she'd be very withdrawn
And then the next minute she'd be putting on makeup...  ...and wearing the tightest sweater that she had to school
No Vanger was ever religious
Can you imagine
She was obviously very unhappy
What do you think happened to her
Everyone knows what
All that I know is that I felt really sorry for her
I got away when I was 18 and I never went back
But she never made it to 18
<i>Mr
Bjurman, please
It's Lisbeth Salander.</i>  <i>Hold for a moment, please.</i>  <i>Lisbeth, I haven't seen you Are you well?</i>  I'm fine
<i>Something the matter?</i>  No, no, nothing to be concerned about
Actually, I need another advance on my allowance
Can I come to your office tonight
<i>I don't work at night, Lisbeth.</i>  <i>Why don't you come to my house, huh
Do you have a pen?</i>  I don't need a pen
What's the address
It's me.</i>  Lisbeth
Come on in
It's nice
It's home
What do you need money for this time
Food
I'm so glad you decided to come and visit
I just want my money
Well, let's see if we can help you out with that
Wait
Is there a problem
I just want to know...  ...am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat
I forgot to ask you:  You like anal sex
<i>Faith is the assurance of things hoped for...</i>  <i>...the evidence of things not seen
Through faith we understand...</i>  <i>...that the world was created by the word of God.</i>   I'll drive you home
I can get home on my own
Is it any warmer inside
No
I apologize if you've been having financial problems...  ...at the magazine during Mikael's absence
We'll work through them
How long do you think you can hang on
Six months
That sounds about right
I used to be in the newspaper business
We owned six dailies back in the '50s
<i> The Courier, here in town
Which I let my nephew, Birger, run...</i>  ...because he can't run anything else
So, what would you say to taking on a partner
We value our independence very much
Independence in publishing is dependent on advertisers
However much you have, you retain
Excuse me
Did I miss something
Talking about investing in the magazine
But why
Not out of greed, that's for sure
I feel badly that I've taken Mikael away from you at the worst possible time
But now I am convinced that this is the right thing to do
The moral thing
That's one reason
And...  And...
How long have you been discussing this with them
I haven't
They called yesterday and asked me to come up
Why didn't you tell me
You live in the woods
I wanted to hear what they had to say
You would've said no before they could
It's a bad idea
You heard me tell them we had six months
I lied
We will be out of business in three
But you don't know this family like I do
They're crazy
If we do this, that's exactly what we're doing
So you wanna say no, let's say no
Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing
What
I'm leaving this godforsaken island in the morning
So are you coming to bed or not
How much do one of those cost
Around 3000
Your call
<i>Vanger Industries took a controlling interest in Millennium magazine...</i>  <i>...which, according to analysts, has been in financial trouble...</i>  <i>Millennium is an excellent magazine We think it's undervalued right now.</i>  <i>Which is good business for us.</i>  Well, there's another reason
I don't like bullies
Are you referring to Mr. Wennerström
I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue his enemies into submission
<i>If Herr Wennerström would like to try it again...</i>  <i>...he will find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight back.</i>  <i>I've always admired Henrik Vanger
Shit
<i>The current archive is on CDs.</i>  <i>The older stuff, still negatives.</i>  What general period are you interested in
September, 1966
Thank you
Is this about Harriet Vanger
Everyone here grows up knowing about her
It's how we're taught about strangers
Lisbeth
I need to pay my rent
Oh, come on in
I feel a bit badly how we left it last time
Me too
Good
You recognize this
I had it with me last time
I set it here, remember
And this snap, you see it
It's a wideangle fiberoptics lens
But I misjudged just how sick you are
Okay
Here's what's going to happen
Pay attention
Look at me
Once you can sit again...  ...which could be a while, I admit, we're going to go to my bank...  ...and tell them that I alone have access to my money
Nod
After that you will never contact me again
How "sociable" I'm becoming
Then you will negotiate with the court...  ...to have my declaration of incompetence lifted
If you fail, this video will spread across the internet like a virus
Nod
And if anything should happen to me, if I get run over by a car...  ...if you run me over with a car, this will upload automatically
Gabardine
I'm taking the keys to this apartment because I'll be checking on you
If I find a girl in here with you, whether she came of her own free will or not...  No, not the video
I'll kill you
Do you doubt what's in the reports that have followed me around all my life
What do they say
If you had to sum it up
They say I'm insane
I am insane
Nod
I know it's going to be hard for you to abide by my rules
The abstinence part most of all
So I'm going to make it easier for you
Lie still
I've never done this before
Hi
Hi
On my way to Skelleftea
I can only stay a couple of hours
What's in Skelleftea
Bible camp
Oh, yeah
It's fine, Nilla
Whatever you want to do is fine
Everybody needs something
Just as long as it's not God
I didn't say that
And I apologize for that
That's what I'm doing
<i>It should've been me visiting you.</i>   I'm sorry
It's okay
It was nice seeing you
Byebye   I'll see you
Yeah
Oh, don't go too hard on the Catholics
The what
The article you're writing
Oh, I'm not writing an article about Catholics
The Bible quotes by your desk
Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist
How are you?</i>  <i>Not still freezing in Hedestad, I hope, for your sake.</i>  You know that Rebecka case you mentioned
<i>Would you recall her last name?</i>  Of course I do
But what has that to do with anything
<i> Nothing, probably
Jacobsson
<i>Her arms were cutoff and she was burned.</i>  <i>But all that happened in the 1940s.</i>  <i> What have you found
I have to call you back.</i>  <i>Why?</i>   Is it Henrik
We were talking
He rubbed his arm, then he collapsed
I honestly don't know
You go
Talk to you later
Evening
So how is he
Well, the good news is he survived
How he does now, we'll have to see
He's in intensive care
Right
May I have one of those
Small Scotch
Sure
Thank you
I hate to be indelicate, but Henrik promised me something...  ...when I agreed to do this
I need to know what he has on him
Now
In case..
In case he dies
And I apologize
I don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me
And he can't tell you in the condition he's in, so...  We also didn't discuss who I'd report to if something should happen to him
Oh, well, you'd report to me, of course
No
No, we don't know that
What do you mean
I may have found something
What have you found
...I lost my life savings
I need a research assistant
Can you authorize that
Yes
Do you have one in mind
I can find someone
I know an excellent one
The what
Well, you don't think we can hire just anyone...  ...without doing a background check
I want to read that
The investigator's name
That is her name, yes
See, I can't find any record of her, and I'm pretty good at that
Would it matter what her name is
If I wanted to speak to her, yes
You sure
Just like your sources
You understand
Okay
My sister
She's also my lawyer
She'll be contacting you
The reason you can find no record of her is because her records are sealed
She's a ward of the state
What's that gotta do with anything
Can we please not make it any rougher
Who is it
It's Mikael Blomkvist
Actually, I'm not really up yet
Please
Hi
You and I need to talk
I've got us some breakf  I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had some company
I'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do
Why don't you put some clothes on, get rid of your girlfriend
We need to talk
I'm sorry, you have to go
Do you need me to stay
No
Bye
Bye
Bye
Sorry
I guess I must have alarmed you, turning up like that
If you touch me, I'll more than alarm you
That won't be necessary
Your report, very detailed
It wasn't meant to be
When I write about people, I try to entertain the reader
Wennerström wasn't entertained much
You gonna sit down
That's the word he used, "sensitive.
I'm gonna use "illegal"...  ...because that's what it was when you hacked into my computer
No, I'm not gonna do anything about that
I could, but I won't
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tell you a story...  ...and if it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research further
And if not, I'll do the washing up and you'll never see me again
Here, you should eat that
What kind of research
I want you to help me catch a killer of women
<i>I've got R.J.</i>  Rebecka Jacobsson
What we've gotta do is find out who they are, what happened to them...  ...and what these Leviticus verses have to do with anything
What are you doing
You can keep talking if you want
Don't you need to look over these
I got it
Cat
How'd you get in
No one has asked me about Magda in over 40 years
It interests me
Does it
<i>Her husband was the first suspect.</i>  <i>The husband is always the first suspect and usually the last.</i>  But not this time
We moved on to a neighbor
Then a vagrant
How exactly was she killed
Miss...
Salander
Miss Salander
I hope you don't mind me asking, but when did you last eat
I can't put on weight
<i>If a man's offering is a lamb, it shall be a female without blemish.</i>  <i>He should lay his hand upon its head...</i>  <i>...slaughter it, empty its blood on the base of the altar...</i>  <i>...and he shall be forgiven.</i>   How is he
He needs surgery...  ...but there's no DNR in place
So it's up to the family to decide...  ...should the occasion arise, whether to resuscitate or not
And they're not good at decisions
She said yes
Do you think I might be able to see him
He was asleep the last time I looked, but let me check
Thank you
Tell him to pack his things and leave
Mother, please
Don't use that tone with me
We should put this to a vote
Don't be an idiot, Birger
We all know what Henrik wants
Can we just do that
Henrik is fighting for his life in there
Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger, there is no smoking in here
Go back to Stockholm
When we need a family chronicle written by a libelist...  ...we know who to call
All right
This way, miss
<i>If a woman approaches any beast...</i>  <i>...and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast.</i>  <i>Their blood shall be upon them.</i>  <i>My family's impossible.</i>  That's why the company's such a mess
I apologize for my mother's behavior
I'm used to it
It's between her and Henrik
She lost it when my father died, and her drinking and her...  Got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her...  ...and left her excommunicated in the old house...  ...on the other side of the island
She hasn't forgiven him
You must stay
Put this to rest one way or another
I'll keep my mother away
But please, hurry
Lisbeth
I'll get that
It's okay
Martin Vanger
How do you do
Fine
It's a girlfriend, or...
Assistant
Good night
Problems finding the place
Everyone in town knows who and where you are
That's comforting
Are you hungry
No
I used to have a motorbike, a Triumph
I know
The five cases from Harriet's list
And five more she missed
Rebecka was the first, just as you thought
The second, M.H., is Mari Holmberg, a prostitute in Kalmar...  ...murdered in 1954, matching Leviticus 20:18
Right
"if a man lies with a woman having her sickness...  ...he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered...  ...the fountain of her blood.
Raped and stabbed, but cause of death was suffocation by sanitary napkin
R.L
Rakel Lunde, 1957
Tied with a clothesline, gagged, raped
Head crushed with a rock
Leviticus 20:27
"A woman who is a medium or sorceress...  ...shall be put to death by stoning.
Sara Witt, 1964
Daughter of a pastor
Tied to her bed
Raped
Charred in the fire that burned down her house
"The daughter of a priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot...  ...profanes her father and shall be burned with fire.
Magda Lovisa Sjöberg, 1960
Found in a barn
Stabbed and raped with farm tools
The cow in the next stall had its throat slit
Its blood was splashed on her and hers on it
"If a woman lies with any beast...  ...you shall kill the woman and the beast
Their blood is upon them.
Found by her sister in their pet shop
Raped, beaten
The killer uncaged the animals, smashed the aquariums
There was a parakeet inside her
A runaway
Raped, strangled
A burnt pigeon tied around her neck
Lena Andersson, 1967
Raped, stabbed, decapitated   Okay
I'm not finished
We're looking for a serial murderer...  ...but what could that have to do with a teenager living on an island
She was looking for him too
<i>Rape
Fire.</i>  Animals
Am I missing anything
The names
They're all Biblical
The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary
Which means they're all Jewish
One thing the Vangers have more than their fair share of, it's antiSemites
There's one right there
I can sleep on a couch
Okay
Right
Good night
Night
Harriet's name isn't
Jewish
No
What are you doing
Reading your notes
Please
Have some coffee
Okay
Then we're gonna have a very serious conversation...  ...about what's yours and what's mine
It's amazing what you figured out with the parade photos
Thank you
Whose
Her
Sorry
Yeah, all right
Close that
No
Not that
Yep
Where the fuck's that
That's down there, isn't it
Oh, yeah, yeah
And...  What does that say there
"N" something "RSJ.
Then something Something "RIF.
"Carpentry.
Well, we need to find a carpenter
Fuck
The carpentry shop is gone
I don't recognize him
Sorry
Well, I had to start somewhere
This is Brannlund's kid
Do you know where I might find him
The son
Next to his father at the cemetery
He was killed in an accident on a construction site, years ago
But...  ...she might still be alive
His widow
Do you know where I might find her
Who took these
A local photographer
You were taking pictures too that day...  ...and I'd love to look at them if by some miracle you have them
We were on our honeymoon
But Why
This girl here
Here, you can see her better in the enlargement
Just after this was taken...  ...after she'd seen something across the street, she was murdered
There you are
Thank you
Would you mind if I made a copy of this
No
I can't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky
So call him
Next time, fill out the proper paperwork
Going down
How's your sex life
I didn't care much for your last report
Let's see a little more enthusiasm for my recovery in next month's
Don't speak
I don't want to hear your voice, just nod
Start looking for a shrink you can bribe...  ...to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me
And stop visiting tattooremoval websites
Is that dental floss
Yes
You're gonna sterilize that, right
No
What
Thank you
Jesus
Drink
Just be careful
Don't move
You're not a doctor
Take off your wet clothes
What
Yeah
Thank you
Yeah, I think it's stopped bleeding
It still fucking hurts, though
I mean, madness
This is fucking madness
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay
Jesus, that hurts
I mean, these people  Somebody was shooting at me
I mean, it wasn't an accident
No one's shooting at you now
You know, I'm pretty sure this is a bad idea
Why
I'm old and we work together  You work with what'shername and that's worked out for you
You need to stop talking
Oh, shit
Do you want me to open a window
I like working with you too
It could have been a stray shot
Not by Gunnar
If he wanted to shoot him, he wouldn't be here
They shoot at anything that moves
Or he's right, Dirch
What if he is
This has to stop
Do you want to stop, Mikael
What I don't have is Vanger Industries' records
That's what I want
Why
Will you authorize it
Well, how far back
Henrik said I could have access to everything
This is what I need
That's not what he meant
I'll sign a nondisclosure statement
Just a minute
To protect him from himself
It's insane
What have we got to hide
After 120 years of business, probably a lot
If this is what he needs to finish, he should have permission
What am I looking for
And everything about Frode
Your father was taking pictures that day that no one has seen
So ask him
I was wondering if you could do that
I don't speak to him
Could you make an exception in my case
Are you afraid to be in the same room with him
I'm not saying you shouldn't be
Sorry
Please
Are you finished
You already have everything
No, I don't
Nothing on subsidiary corporations, partnerships or suppliers
You'll have to do without
Mr. Frode said I have access...  ...to whatever I need
I need this  You have access to this floor
Thank you for seeing me
Come in
Tea
Please
Sven Olov Lindholm
Handsome
Me
Per Engdahl
But your interest is in my more candid photographic work
Friends, relations, that kind of thing
"Blom" or "Bloom"
Blomkvist
I'm not a recluse
I don't close my door to anybody
They just don't visit
Well...  ...perhaps if you redecorated
Hide the past like they do
Under a thin, shiny veneer
I am the most honest of all of them
The family
Sweden
Some nice landscapes there
Who is this
The blurry one
I can't tell
Oh, that's Gottfried's boy
That's Martin
Yeah
Handsome but useless young man
We're closing
Nowhere near finished
I'm not authorized to stay late
I am
And I need access to everything, including anything that's locked
Call Frode
Leave the keys with the guard
Come on
Mikael
Hi there
Your evening stroll
Yes, that's right, I...   How are you
Good
I stopped by the hospital on my way home
Henrik asked me to ask you something
What was that
I'll make you a drink
Hello, Martin
It's quite windy
What happened to you
When
I fell in the dark
You don't have a flashlight
I'll get you one
I just wasn't being careful, that's all
How's the investigation going
Nothing new to report
Dirch says the girl is really clever
Maybe she'll turn something up
Thank you for that
So, what did he say
What
You said Henrik asked you to ask me something
What
How's the investigation
Oh, yeah
That was his question
Do you hunt
Sure
Nothing at all new to report
No
I can see you're anxious
No
No, I mean to get home after the walk
Yeah, well, I suppose I am
To have dinner with your girlfriend
We'll have better luck with a gun
I'm sorry
When we go hunting
Rather than a knife
I want to show you something
Bring your drink
Leave my knife
<i>Hi, leave a message
I'll call</i>  You know what's harder than shooting someone
Just missing him
That was a very good shot up at the cabin
It didn't work
Mikael, it did work
You're here
Inside
You spilled your drink
May I
How did you do it
What did you find
We can talk or we can just get on with it
Of
You
In an Uppsala prep school blazer
You lied about where you were that day
Did I
Or rather, when
So what
People lie all the time
Lena  That was a long time ago
Where's this photo now
There's a copy on my laptop
There's another copy...  ...on a secure website
Secure website
That's a lie
How much does the girl know
I hope it's as much as you do
That'll make it fun
Where is she
She went this morning
That's a lie
I got a call from our archives manager
She was very perturbed with this girl Lisbeth
I like that name
Lisbeth
I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me
Hey, he)'  So, what do you wanna know
You're a journalist, ask me questions
What do I do with the girls
That's a good question
I like that part a lot
Having a chat when both of you know that one of you is going to die
Unlike my father, who left them scattered...  ...all over the place, like trophies
That's not very smart, if you ask me
Well, he was a loud and garish man
You can't be a sloppy technician like that
You can't drink to excess like he did
This takes discipline
It's a science of a thousand details
It's the cleanup
I guess I don't have to tell you...  ...but you're going to create quite a mess here
Let me ask you something
Why don't people trust their instincts
They sense something is wrong...  ...someone is walking too close behind them
You knew something was wrong
But you came back into the house
Did I force you
No
All I had to do was offer you a drink
It's hard to believe that the fear of offending...  ...can be stronger than the fear of pain, but you know what
And they always come willingly
They know it's all over, just like you do
But somehow, they still think they have a chance
"Maybe if I say the right thing
Maybe if I'm polite
If I cry, if I beg.
...I can feel myself...  ...getting hard
But, you know, we're not that different, you and I
We both have urges
Satisfying mine...  ...requires more towels
...I had Irina down here in that cage
Who is Irina, you might ask
Just another girl
Just another immigrant whore
Who misses them
Your sister wasn't
What
You found her
You killed her
You useless fucking detective
This too tight to talk
Good
I'm tired of talking to you
I've never had a man in here before
That was our duty
Harriet's and mine
Hey
There's a gun
There's a gun on the television
Yeah
How come a 23yearold...  ...is a ward of the state
Since when have they said that
Since I was 12
I'm sorry, that's none of my business
I tried to kill my father
Burned him alive
Got about 80 percent of him
I made some coffee
Who's that
I found it in Martin's basement among his souvenirs
No, Martin didn't deny killing anyone
But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused
He got angry at me because I couldn't tell him what had happened to her
He didn't kill her
His father didn't do it
What if she did somehow manage to get away
I mean, if...  ...she is still alive...  ...then there's only one person in this family who'd know where she is
Fuck me
Fuck me
Your turn
Here
Hi
Look, I'm sorry to bother you
What do you want
Has no one called you
Your cousin Martin
What about him
He died in a car accident...  ...last Thursday
I'm not interested in any memorial
Well, I understand
What do you understand
Well, that you don't care very much for your family
Look, I just thought you should know
How'd it go
Okay, I think
She's on
And she's shopping
She's still playing solitaire
No
We have her cell phone too
I was so sure she was gonna lead us to her
Put your hand back in my shirt
She can't
I was just thinking that   Just one second
Okay
What were you going to say
I was just thinking, there could be one other possibility
Well, we could, absolutely
What is it now
So you sent the flowers
Yes, I did
But the family never knew, did they
No
So I'm guessing she then came here on her marriedname passport...  ...and you followed on her maidenname passport
No, actually, it was the other way around
She thought that it was safer if I traveled with Spencer myself
Nothing
Only that he loved her
She said, "if you love me, you'll do this and not ask why.
And they both died 20 years ago
Car accident
You found that out too
Is that you
I was 14 the first time he raped me
Martin
No, my father
Well, why didn't you tell somebody
My mother
Henrik would've done something
I almost told him
But I was afraid because of what I'd done
I...  You still don't understand, do you
He quoted from the Bible as he tore my clothes off
<i>He tied a belt around my neck.</i>  He wanted to kill me
I got out of the house
<i>I went down to the dock.</i>  He came staggering after me
I could never fight him off in a small space...  <i>...but out in the open...</i>  ...I was strong enough to deal with an old drunk
When it was over..
<i>...I looked up and Martin was standing there, staring at me.</i>  And all I'd accomplished was substitute one for another
<i>And then I saw him the day of the parade...</i>  <i>...across the street.</i>  <i>And I knew that it would never be over.</i>  So how did you escape
Anita
She...  She insisted that I leave everything behind
<i>As everyone ate dinner, I was no more than 20 meters away from them.</i>  <i>I spent the night there
That's when the search started.</i>  <i>In the morning, she came to get me.</i>  <i>I'd grown up with that bridge as my link to home...</i>  <i>...but all I could think is...</i>  ...if I could just get away from them...  <i>...just get past the police...</i>  <i>...then I might be safe.</i>  <i>And I was.</i>  Until you showed up
You're safe now
How did you get away
Someone saved me too   How are you feeling
Thank you, Anna
I made you a promise...  ...whether you found anything or not
What's this
Hello, Henrik
I barely remember Wennerström working here, much less being fired  How could you
You're referring to the statute of limitations...  ...but I had no idea this is what Henrik was holding out
If I had, I never would've let him bring you up here
He wasn't trying to deceive you
He knows you can't try somebody 35 years after the event
I like Henrik, but he knows that
A man's reputation means something
He thought you could destroy Wennerström...  ...in the court of public opinion
The court of public opinion...  ...celebrates people's bad behavior
He's an elderly man
He promised me Wennerström's carcass on a plate
I can't do anything with this
Yes, of course
What happened with Wennerström
How did he get you
I heard something
I got it from an anonymous source...  ...who I'm now sure was one of Wennerström's lackeys
It was fake
Which he easily proved in court
You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life...  ...was illegal and immoral
I did some work on my own on him...  ...before you hired me
I haven't looked at it all...  ...because you and HarrietfuckingVanger...  ...have kept me busy
But I may have something
You may have something
Maybe
They launder money from arms and drug sales...  ...and crime syndicates in Russia
And that money accounts for all but 5 percent of his holdings
The rest ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands
This time you don't want to know
This time I do want to know
I have access to his computer
And how do you have that
I could've gotten it from a source inside the company
You didn't
And what will you say to me
Well, that depends if you really want to know
I do
Mikael, how did you get access
<i>Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist...</i>  <i>...who, this time last year was convicted of libel...</i>  <i>...in a Stockholm courtroom...</i>  <i>...doesn't seem to have learned from his mistakes.</i>  <i>Or maybe he has.</i>  <i>In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges...</i>  <i>...the company that sued him, the Wennerström Group...</i>  The shit hits the fan
Well, he'll say it's a personal vendetta, which won't wash
The police will investigate, Fl will investigate
Maybe he'll go to prison
You think
Probably not
What's wrong with you
It's embarrassing
Tell me
I need to borrow some money
Fifty thousand
I have a chance to make an investment
I really don't think I've got 50,000
Yes, you do
I'm sorry that I know that
You'll get the money back, I promise
Okay
Okay
You want a coffee
All of it.</i>  <i>The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite as certain as Mr. Wennerström of that.</i>  <i>If a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist alleges proves to be true...</i>  <i>...not only will there be a securities investigation...</i>  <i>...but an organizedcrime inquiry as well.</i>  <i>Mr
Blomkvist names no sources.</i>  <i>And we can't force him to
But we can look for them.</i>  <i> Beginning where
Those closest to Mr. Wennerström.</i>  <i>Only someone in the inner circle of a corporation like this...</i>  <i>...has access to this kind of information.</i>  <i>Mr
Wennerström isn't available for comment...</i>  <i>...but I'm happy to answer questions.</i>  <i> Where is he
Has he left the country?</i>  <i>I don't think so.</i>   Okay
Thank you
Thank you
May I have your passport, please
<i>With his failure to appear...</i>  <i>...before a Security Exchange Commission panel...</i>  <i>...a warrant has been issued for the Wennerström Group CEO.</i>  <i>I can confirm that he left Sweden...</i>  <i>...on a private jet that landed in Paris last week.</i>  <i>Whether he's still there, we don't know.</i>  <i>He can be anywhere by now.</i>  Thank you
I have accounts at Bank of Kroenenfeld, Cayman Islands
I'd like to transfer them and convert to bonds
Naturally, you have the clearing codes
Naturally
Thirty
This will take some time
You will receive 4 percent commission
I will
Then it won't be a waste of it
All 50, into five accounts
That looks correct
<i>The man who is now being called Sweden's Charles Ponzi...</i>  <i>...may no longer have a country to call home...</i>  <i>...but does have enough money to buy one.</i>  <i>According to the International Banking Commission...</i>  <i>Wennerström, a week after the Millennium article appeared</i>  <i>...on newsstands, began emptying accounts...</i>  <i>...at Bank of Kroenenfeld in the Cayman Islands.</i>  <i>That money, approximately 2 billion euros...</i>  <i>...was then spread over a number of accounts...</i>  <i>...with the help of this confederate, seen here in Zurich.</i>   Hey
Hey
The money I borrowed
Already
Thank you
No, I quit
It was a good investment
It was okay
I'm seeing my daughter
Okay
You look nice
I'll see you soon
<i>Mr
Wennerström won the libel case..</i>  You got that call in the office
I miss our meetings
I'm sure you don't
I was always such a headache for you
Never showing up with good news, only problems
I have good news now
I made a friend
I mean, one that you'd approve of
<i>A man who authorities here in Marbella have confirmed...</i>  <i>...is fugitive HansErik Wennerström, shot three times in the head...</i>  <i>...in what police are calling a classic gangland execution.</i>  <i>The investigation into Wennerström's ties...</i>  <i>...to crime organizations worldwide will now turn into speculation.</i>  <i>Which of them caught up with him before Swedish authorities could?</i>  <i>Wennerström spent the last days of his flamboyant life...</i>   It's nice
Your father
A friend
Must be a very good friend
We're late
That can't possibly be true
It is
What would account for that
Well, first, an awful lot of people live in China, but here's my question
I didn't know they take SATs in China
They don't
I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about me
Yes
I could sing in an a Capella group, but I can't sing
Does that mean you actually got nothing wrong
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC
Or I get into a final club
You know, from a woman's perspective,  sometimes not singing in an a Capella group is a good thing
On the other hand, I do like guys who row crew
Well, I can't do that
I was kidding
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test
Have you ever tried
To row crew
To get into a final club
No
Are you, like, whatever, delusional
Maybe it's just sometimes you say two things at once
I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to be aiming at
But you've seen guys who row crew, right
No
They're worldclass athletes
And a second ago, you said you like guys who row crew  so I assumed you had met one
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it
Okay
Should we get something to eat
Would you like to talk about something else
No
It's just since the beginning of the conversation about finals club,  I think I may have missed a birthday
There are really more people in China with genius IQs than the entire population..
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc
Which one
It's the best of the best
Which Roosevelt
Theodore
Is it true that they send a bus around to pick up girls  who want to party with the next Fed chairman
So you can see why it's so important to get in
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into
Why would you ask me that
None of them
That's the point
The ability to make money doesn't impress anybody around here
Must be nice
He made $300,000 in a summer
He likes meteorology
You said it was oil futures
You can read the weather, you can predict the price of heating oil
You asked me which one was the easiest to get into  because you think that that's the one where I'll have the best chance
The one that's the easiest to get into would be the one  where anybody has the best chance
You didn't ask me which one was the best one,  you asked me which one was the easiest one
I was honestly just asking, okay
I was just asking to ask
Mark, I'm not speaking in code
Erica
You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about it  who will prescribe you some sort of medication
You don't care if the side effects may include blindness
Final clubs
Not "finals clubs.
Yes
There is
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code
I didn't mean to be cryptic
I'm just saying I need to do something substantial  in order to get the attention of the clubs
Because they're exclusive
And fun, and they lead to a better life
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president  because he was a member of the Phoenix Club
He was a member of the Porcellian, and yes, he did
Well, why don't you just concentrate on being the best you you can be
I was kidding
Just because something's trite doesn't make it less true
I wanna try to be straightforward with you  and tell you I think you might want to be a little more supportive
If I get in, I will be taking you to the events and the gatherings,  and you'll be meeting a lot of people you wouldn't normally get to meet
You would do that for me
Okay
Well, I wanna try and be straightforward with you  and let you know that we're not anymore
What do you mean
We're not dating anymore
I'm sorry
No, it's not
You're breaking up with me
You're gonna introduce me to people  I wouldn't normally have the chance to meet
What the... What is that supposed to mean
Wait, settle down
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink right now  is 'cause you used to sleep with the door guy
"The door guy"
His name is Bobby
I have not slept with the door guy
Wait
Wait, wait
I'm going back to my dorm
Is this real
Yes
Then wait, I apologize, okay
I have to go study
Erica
I'm sorry, I mean it
I appreciate that, but I have to go study
Come on, you don't have to study
Let's just talk
Why
Because it is exhausting
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster
Currently..
I wasn't making a comment on your appearance
I was saying that you go to BU
I was stating a fact, that's all,  and if it seemed rude, then I apologize
I have to go study
Why do you keep saying I don't have to study
'Cause you go to BU
Do you want to get some food
I am sorry you are not sufficiently impressed with my education
I don't want friends
I was just being polite
I have no intention of being friends with you
I'm under some pressure right now from my OS class  and if we could just order some food, I think we should..
But you're gonna go through life thinking that girls don't like you  because you're a nerd
And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that won't be true
It'll be because you're an asshole
Erica Albright's a bitch
Do you think that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht,  or do you think it's because all BU girls are bitches
She's a 34B, as in barely anything there
False advertising
The truth is, she has a nice face
I need to do something to take my mind off her
I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie
So what if it's not even 10:00 p.m. And it's a Tuesday night
Billy
Billy Olson's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of the pictures  next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who's hotter
Good call, Mr. Olson
Yeah, it's on
I'm not gonna do the farm animals,  but I like the idea of comparing two people together
It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel  since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit  than, say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness,  like they do on hotornot
Com
The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook,  so I'm going to have to get all the images  from the individual houses that people are in
First up is Kirkland
So a little Wget magic is all that's necessary to download the entire Kirkland facebook
Kids' stuff
Next is Eliot
They're also open, but with no indexes on Apache
I can run an empty search  and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page
And I can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me
Excellent
Excuse me
Everybody
You are at one of the oldest, one of the most exclusive clubs,  not just at Harvard, but in the world
And I want to welcome you all  to Phoenix Club's first party of the fall semester
They require a user name/password combo,  and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't have access to the main FAS user database,  so they have no way of detecting an intrusion
Adams has no security, but limits the number of results to 20 a page
All I need to do is break out the same script I used on Lowell and we're set
Quincy has no online facebook
Nothing I can do about that
Dunster is intense
Not only is there no public directory, but there's no directory at all
And once you do get results, they don't link directly to the images
They link to a PHP that redirects or something
Weird
This may be difficult
Hey, Shark Week's on
What
Great white, beautiful fish
Nice
Leverett is a little better
So it's definitely necessary to break out Emacs and modify that Perl script
Here you go
Done
Hey, what's going on
Perfect timing
Eduardo's here and he's going to have the key ingredient
Hey, Mark
Wardo
How did you know that
It's on your blog
Yeah
I need you
I'm here for you
No, I need the algorithm you use to rank chess players
Are you okay
You mean other students
Yeah
You think this is such a good idea
I need the algorithm
Mark..
Give each girl a base rating of 1400
When any two girls are matched up, there's an expectation of which will win  based on their current rating, right
Yeah
And those expectations are expressed this way
Let's write it
One on the left
The right
Yeah, still the right
Who should we send it to first
Dwyer
Who are you gonna send it to
Just a couple of people
The question is,  who are they gonna send it to
Hey, guys, check this out
Someone go to the left
Dude, do left
Right or left
Left is hot
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Right or left
That's my roommate
The girl on the left
This is pathetic
Right
Left
Left
Left
Albright
He blogged about you
You don't wanna read it
Left
Latina
Is this yours
I stole it from a tranny
Get the hell out of here
Left
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down before we get into trouble
Hello
Wait, wait, wait, wait
What
Well, there's a very unusual amount of traffic to the switch at Kirkland
You're saying it's unusual for 4:00 in the morning
No, this'd be unusual for halftime at the Super Bowl
All right
I gotta go in
What's going on
You don't think..
Go see if it's everybody's
I can't connect
The network's down
Unless it's a coincidence, I think this is us
Holy shit
So you were called in front of the Ad Board
That's not what happened
You weren't called in front of the Administrative Board
I mean back at the bar with Erica Albright
She said all that
Mark...  That I said that stuff to her
I was reading from the transcript of her deposition
Yeah, why would you even need to depose her
That's really for us to decide
You think if I know she can make me look like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute
It's been almost three hours
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg  with the girl's testimony from the bar
She was under oath
Then I guess that would be the first time somebody's lied under oath
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours
Thousand
What
Wow
These guys are just freaking fast
Jump out and swim
I think we'd have to jump out and drown
Well, you could row forward and I could row backward
We're genetically identical
Science says we'd stay in one place
Just row the damn boat
What
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked the network from a laptop at Kirkland
At 4:00 a.m.  How
He set up a website where you vote on the hotness of female undergrads
What were we doing that none of us heard about this
I don't know
Full course load
Studying
Another three hours in the tank and then studying
How much activity was there on this thing
Twentytwo thousand page requests
Twentytwo thousand
Cam, this guy hacked the facebook of seven houses
He set up the whole website in one night, and he did it while he was drunk
Well, how do you know he was drunk
He was blogging simultaneously
You know what I think
This is our guy
Cameron Winklevoss
WlNKLEVOSS
"Cameron" spelled the usual way
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my last name is the same as my brother's
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an Administrative Board hearing
You're being accused of intentionally breaching security,  violating copyrights,  violating individual privacy by creating the website www.facemash.com
You're also charged with being in violation of university policy,  on distribution of digitized images
Before we begin with our questioning, you're allowed to make a statement
Would you like to do so
As for any charges stemming from the breach of security,  I believe I deserve some recognition from this board
I'm sorry
Yes
I don't understand
You deserve recognition
I believe I've pointed out some pretty gaping holes in your system
Excuse me, may I
Mr. Zuckerberg,  I'm in charge of security for all computers on the Harvard network,  and I can assure you of its sophistication
In fact, it was that level of sophistication that led us to you in less than four hours
Four hours
Yes, sir
So
Six months academic probation
Wow
They had my blog
I shouldn't have written that thing about the farm animals
That was stupid
But I was kidding, for God's sakes
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor
I tried to stop you
How do you do this thing where you manage to get all girls to hate us
And why do I let you
I know
You can't do that
Okay, let's look at a sample problem
Suppose we're given a computer with a 16bit virtual address  and a page size of 256 bytes
The system uses onelevel page tables that start at address hex 400
Maybe you want DMA on your 16bit system
The first few pages are reserved for hardware flags, etc
Assume pagetable entries have eight status bits
The eight status bits would then be..
Anybody
And I see we have our first surrender
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg
One valid bit, one modified bit, one reference bit and five permission bits
That is correct
Does everybody see how he got there
Mark
Cameron Winklevoss
Hi
Tyler Winklevoss
Are you guys related
That's good
Funny
So, what can I do for you
Did I insult your girlfriends
No
Actually, I don't know
Yeah, we never asked
We should do that
No
We have an idea we want to talk to you about
You got a minute
We have to
Why
We row crew
Yeah, I've got a minute
Great
No
I've heard
You want a sandwich or something
Okay
Mark, right
Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner
Hi
We were really impressed with Facemash
I don't know CourseMatch
You go online and see what courses your friends are taking
It's really smart, man
Mark
Yeah
It was kind of a nobrainer
But you invented something in high school, too, right
An app for an MP3 player that recognizes your taste in music
Anybody try to buy it
Microsoft
Wow
How much
Uploaded it for free
For free
Yeah
Why
It's called the Harvard Connection
You create your own page
Interests, bio, friends, pics
And then people can go online, see your bio, request to be your...  Yeah, how is that different from MySpace or Friendster
Edu
Harvard
I mean, the whole site's kind of based on the idea that girls...  Not to put anything indelicately, but..
Girls wanna go with guys who go to Harvard
The main difference between what we're talking about and MySpace or Friendster,  or any of those other social networking sites is...  Is exclusivity
Right
Right
Yeah
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark
And we know that you've been taking it in the shins
Women's groups are ready to declare a fatwa
But, you know, this could help rehabilitate your image
Wow
You would do that for me
We'd like to work with you
Our second programmer just got overwhelmed with schoolwork
We would need you to build the site and write the code, and we'll provide all the..
I'm in
What
Awesome
That's what you said
It was three or four years ago
I don't know what I said
I don't understand that question
The affirmative
When did you come to Eduardo with the idea for Facebook
It was called The Facebook then
This doesn't need to be that difficult
I'm currently in the middle of two different lawsuits
Did you say yes
I said I'd help
When did you approach Mr. Saverin with the idea for The Facebook
I wouldn't say I approached him
Sy
You can answer the question
What's that
The Jewish fraternity
It was Caribbean Night
It's not that guys like me are generally attracted to Asian girls
It's that Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me
I don't think it's that complicated
They're hot, they're smart,  they're not Jewish, and they can't dance
Mark
Be right back
I think I've come up with something
Hang on
What
I got punched by the Phoenix
Are you kidding
I mean, it's just the first of a fourstep process,  but they slid the invitation under my door tonight
I go to my first punch party tomorrow
So...  You got punched by the Phoenix
Yeah, but, you know, it was probably just a diversity thing
Just ride that horse until...  What did you wanna talk to me about
Mark
Yeah
Yeah, I think I've come up with something
Come outside and let's talk
It's 20 degrees outside
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls,  which has absolutely nothing to do with the Caribbean
People came to Facemash in a stampede, right
Yeah
You can go anywhere on the Internet and see pictures of hot girls
Yeah
People want to go on the Internet and check out their friends,  so why not build a website that offers that
Friends, pictures, profiles, whatever you can visit
Browse around
Maybe it's someone you just met at a party
But I'm not talking about a dating site
I'm talking about taking the entire social experience of college and putting it online
I can't feel my legs
I know
But, Wardo
Yeah
"It would be exclusive.
You would have to know the people on the site to get past your own page
Now, that's good
Wardo, it's like a final club, except we're the president
I told him I thought it sounded great
It was a great idea
And people had the ability to invite, or not invite, their friends to join
See, in a world where social structure was everything,  that was the thing
It was a big project,  and he was going to have to write tens of thousands of lines of code,  so I wondered why he was coming to me and not his roommates,  Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes
They were programmers
We're gonna need a little startup cash to rent the servers and get it online
So that was why
Yes
We'll split it, 70/30
70 for me, 30 for you for putting up the $1,000  and for handling everything on the business end
You're CFO
And you said
Okay
Yes
It probably was a diversity thing
But so what
Why do you think he said that
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting, but whose discovery is this
What are you suggesting
That I was jealous of Eduardo for getting punched by the Phoenix  and began a plan to screw him out of a company   I hadn't even invented yet
Were you
Gretchen
Jealous of Eduardo
Stop typing
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,  and so you know that money isn't a big part of my life
But at the moment, I could buy Mount Auburn Street,  take the Phoenix Club and turn it into my pingpong room
I'll let you know how the party is
We recognize that you're a plaintiff in one suit involving Facebook,  and a witness in another
At any time in the weeks prior to Mark's telling you his idea,  did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss,  Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection
Yes
He said they'd asked him to work on their site,  but that he looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time
He said even his most pathetic friends  knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys
"These guys," meaning my clients
But Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything
With Facemash, he'd hacked into the Harvard computers,  he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board, he'd gotten a lot of notoriety
Facemash did exactly what he wanted it to do
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building The Facebook,  he was also communicating with the plaintiffs
Not at the time, I wasn't
It really didn't have much to do with the Winklevosses' dating site
How would you know
You weren't even there
Ty
You're offering a conclusion not found in evidence
We are about to find it in evidence
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss
November 30th, 2003
"And it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement
"So we can talk about it after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night.
From Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron Winklevoss
December 1 st, 2003
I just got about three of your missed calls
"I was working on a problem set for my systems class.
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
December 10, 2003
"This week has been pretty busy thus far with classes and work,  "so I think it's probably best to postpone the meeting.
"I'm also really busy tomorrow.
Tell him okay,  but we do have to make sure that we meet up before we all go off for break
Yeah, watch out
Hey, Mark
I need a dedicated Linux box running Apache with a MySQL back end
It's gonna cost a little more money
How much more
Do we need it
Gotta handle the traffic
Do it
Hey, guess what
I made the second cut
That's good
You should be proud of that right there
Don't worry if you don't make it any further
I'll get out of here
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss  and Divya Narendra
December 15th, 2003
"I won't really be free to meet until next Wednesday afternoon.
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon
"I've basically been in the lab this whole time, and also I..."  "...won't be able to do Saturday, as I have to meet up with my parents.
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard, founder of Harvard University in 1638
What are the three lies
Mr. Dowd
The three lies
Take your pants off
Mr. Saverin
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638
Two, Harvard was not founded by John Harvard
And three, that is not John Harvard
It's a friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester
Keep your jacket on
Thirtynine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's initial meeting with my clients,  and he still hadn't completed work on Harvard Connection
But on January 11th, 2004,  Mr. Zuckerberg registered the domain name The Facebook  via Network Solutions
To the best of your knowledge, had he even begun work on Harvard Connection
Not to my knowledge
No
"Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical that we have enough functionality in the site  "to really draw the attention and gain the critical mass necessary  "to get a site like this to run"
"We'll speak soon"
This is the first time he mentioned any problem
You sent 36 emails to Mr. Zuckerberg and received 16 emails in return,  and this was the first time he indicated he was not happy
That's correct
He had 42 days to study our system and get out ahead
Do you see any of your code on Facebook
Sy, could you...  Did I use any of your code
Fellas
Match.com for Harvard guys
Can I continue with my deposition
You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,  you'd have invented Facebook
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder and watch you write us a check
No shit
February 4, 2004
Mark
There is a girl in your art history class
Her name is Stephanie Attis
Do you happen to know if she has a boyfriend
And, if not, do you happen to know if she's looking to go out with anyone
Dustin
We were supposed to meet at 9:00
Have you slept yet
I have to add something
What
That looks really good
It's clean and simple
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls.
But watch
What'd you write
"Relationship Status.
"Interested In.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?
And at its center, you know, that's what The Facebook is gonna be about
People are gonna log on because after all the cake and watermelon,  there's a chance they're actually gonna...   Gonna get laid
...meet a girl
Yes
That is really good
And that was it
It's ready
It's ready
Yeah
That was it
And here's the masthead
You made a masthead
Yeah
"Eduardo Saverin, cofounder and CFO.
Yeah
Sure I do
So when's it going live
Right now
Get your laptop out
Why do we need my laptop
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool with them that I spam their emails
This is not spam
No, I know it's not spam
I haven't gotten in yet
These guys know people
And I need their emails
Sure
Good
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu
These guys
Yeah, they're literary geniuses  because the world's most obvious Lewis Carroll reference is in..
I'm just saying
Yeah, you're right
The site's live
You know, let's go get a drink and celebrate
Mark
Mark, are you praying
Whatever happened to Cole Porter and Irving Berlin
It's a Valentine's Day theme
They're playing love songs
Good point
'Cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin never wrote any love songs
Honey, you should put your laptop away
KC
What is it
I don't know
No, it's not
Div
What
This isn't mine
Okay, what is wrong
It's fine
It's fine
Hey
Not now
Okay
I just wanted to let you know that Zuckerberg stole our website
Mark Zuckerberg
It's been live for more than 36 hours
Mr. Hotchkiss
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad
"Welcome to The Facebook
"The Facebook is an online directory that connects people  "through different social networks
"You must have a harvard
Edu address to register.
Yeah, I called earlier
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg
He's actually quoted a couple times
"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal facebook within Harvard,' he says.
"He" meaning Mark
"'I think it's kind of silly that it would take the university  "'a couple of years to get around to it
"'I can do a classier job than they can and I did it in a week."
I know, that's how he talks
Appreciate it
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,  "over 650 students had registered to use thefacebook
Com
"He said he anticipated that 900 students would have joined the site by this morning.
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't give free drugs to 650 people in one day
And this guy doesn't have three friends to rub together to make a fourth
Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss
We'll put all this together and we'll email it to you
Well, you won't be able to go on the website yourself
Because you don't have a Harvard...  You know what, it would just be easier for us to email it to you
He's a good guy and he's very bright and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...  Wow
...what he did
All right, thank you very much
And, Dad...  All right, love you, too
We don't know that he's not a good guy
We know he stole our idea
We know he lied to our faces for a month and a half
No, he never lied to our faces
Fine, he lied to our email accounts and he gave himself a 42day head start,  because he knows what apparently you don't,  which is that getting there first is everything
I'm a competitive racer, Div
I don't think you need to school me in the importance of getting there first
Thank you
That was your father's lawyer
It was his inhouse counsel
What's that gonna do
What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer and sue him
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat the shit out of him with a hammer
We don't even have to do that
We could do that ourselves
I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me
I'm with this guy
Well, whatever
I'm saying, let's calm down until we know what we're talking about
We met with Mark three times, we exchanged 52 emails,  we can prove that he looked at the code
What is that on the bottom of the page
It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production.
On every page
Shit, I need a second to let the classiness waft over me
Okay, look, we don't know...  Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said he hoped the privacy options  "would help restore his reputation  "following student outrage over facemash
Com.
That's exactly what we said to him
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer to look this stuff over,  we can at least get something going in the paper so people know...   What
...that this is in dispute
And we're not suing anybody
Why not
I don't understand, I don't understand
Why not
What, who, me
Say it
Why not
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard
You thought he was gonna be the only one who thought that was stupid
During the time when you say you had this idea,  did you know Tyler and Cameron came from a family of means
"A family of means"
Did you know their father was wealthy
I'm not sure why you're asking me that
It's not important you be sure why I'm asking
It's not important to you
Did you know that they came from money
I had no idea whether they came from money or not
In one of your emails to Mr. Narendra,  you referenced Howard Winklevoss' consulting firm
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose assets are in the hundreds of millions
You also knew Tyler and Cameron were members  of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian
They pointed that out
Excuse us for inviting you in
To the bike room
Yes
Let me tell you why I'm asking
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000 for an Internet venture,  you didn't ask my clients for it
They had demonstrated an interest to you in that kind of thing
I went to my friend for the money because that's who I wanted to be partners with
Eduardo was the president of the Harvard Investors Association,  and he was also my best friend
Your best friend is suing you for $600 million
Tell me more
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind addressing him as Mr. Saverin
Gretchen, they're best friends
Not anymore
Well, we already went through this on the... Never mind
Mr. Saverin, what happened after the initial launch
It exploded
"Facebook me" was a common expression after two weeks
And Mark
And Mark was the biggest thing on a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,  15 Pulitzer Prize winners, two future Olympians, and a movie star
Who was the movie star
Does it matter
No
It was a beautiful day and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room
He brought that magazine up and he showed it to me and he said,  "Look, it's gonna happen without us
And I said, "Okay
Let's get BASIC out there.
The beginnings of this industry were very humble
That kit computer on the cover of that magazine had an 8080 processor in it
Unless you paid extra for a 1 K memory board, you got 256 bytes
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC wasn't just to run at 4 kbytes,  but I also had to leave room for the users to run their programs in 4 kbytes
Your friend
Is that Mark Zuckerberg
Yeah
He made The Facebook
I mean, it's both of ours
Yes
Cool
I'm Christy Ling
This is Alice
Hi
Facebook me when you get home
You know, maybe we can all go out and grab a drink
Certainly
Absolutely do that
She said, "Facebook me and we can all go for a drink later,"  which is stunningly great for two reasons
One, she said "facebook me," right
They wanna have drinks later
Excuse me, Mark
Yeah
I'm Stuart Singer
I'm in your OS lab
Sure
Awesome job with The Facebook
Thanks
I'm Bob
How you doing
You know, I could swear he was looking at you  when he said the next Bill Gates could be right in this room
I doubt it
I don't even know who the speaker was
Shit, that makes sense
All right
Thanks, guys
Are you a moron
Are you medically stupid
You can't tell Bill Gates is in front of you for an hour
Can I get a Glock and kill you
It's time to monetize the thing
What were their names
When
I said it's time to monetize the site
It means it's time for the website to start generating revenue
No, I know what the word means
I'm asking how you wanna do it
Advertising
No
Well, we got 4,000 members
'Cause The Facebook is cool,  and if we start installing popups for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool
We don't know what it is
We don't know what it can be
We don't know what it will be
We know that it is cool
So when will it be finished
It won't be finished
That's the point
The way fashion's never finished
What
You're talking about fashion
Really, you
I'm talking about the idea of it and I'm saying that it's never finished
Okay
But they manage to make money selling pants
Mark, what is this
What
This
Who
The girls
When did you get this
About 10 days ago
Right after we launched the site
Hey, the girls
What were their names
The Winklevoss twins are saying that you stole their idea
I find that to be a little more than mildly annoying
Oh, well, they find it to be intellectual property theft
Look...  Why didn't you show this to me
They're saying that we stole The Facebook from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses
I know what it says
Did we
Did we what
Look at me
The letter says we could face legal action
No, it says I could face legal action
This is from a lawyer, Mark
The lawyer is their father's house counsel
Do they have grounds
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code, I promise
I didn't use anything
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair doesn't owe money  to everyone who ever has built a chair, okay
They came to me with an idea, I had a better one
I didn't think it was a big deal
Okay
So if there's something wrong, if there's ever anything wrong, you can tell me
I'm the guy that wants to help
This is our thing
Now, is there anything that you need to tell me
No
And what did you say
"When we met in January, I expressed my doubts about the site
"Where it stood with graphics, how much programing was left  "that I had not anticipated.
"The lack of hardware we had to deal with site use,  "the lack of promotion that would go on to successfully launch the website.
I'd raised concerns before
Bullshit
Not to us
Gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting in January to which this letter is referring
Let me rephrase this
You sent my client 16 emails
In the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns
Is that a question
In the 16th email you raised concerns about the site's functionality
Were you leading them on for six weeks
No
Then why didn't you raise any of these concerns before
I'm sorry
It just started raining
No
Do you think I deserve it
What
I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition  and I don't wanna perjure myself, so I have a legal obligation to say no
Okay
No
You don't think I deserve your attention
You have part of my attention
You have the minimum amount
The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook,  where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room,  including and especially your clients,  are intellectually or creatively capable of doing
Well, I have 12:45
Why don't we say that's lunch
Back at 2:30
So what were their names
Their names were Christy and Alice,  and they wanna have drinks tonight
You're not supposed to be in here
This is a men's room
Wow
I don't care
Hey, man, sorry
Sweet
We have groupies
I'll be right back
Mark, where you going
Mark
Erica
I saw you from over there
I didn't know you came to this club a lot
First time
Could I talk to you alone for a second
I think I'm good right here
I'd love to talk to you alone if we could just go someplace
Right here is fine
I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched
No
You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark
That's why I wanted to talk to you
On the Internet
Comparing women to farm animals
I didn't end up doing that
It didn't stop you from writing it
As if every thought that tumbles through your head was so clever  it would be a crime for it not to be shared
The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink,  and you published that Erica Albright was a bitch,  right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, my bra size,  and then rated women based on their hotness
Erica, is there a problem
You write your snide bullshit from a dark room  because that's what the angry do nowadays
I was nice to you
Don't torture me for it
If we could just go somewhere for a minute..
Okay
Good luck with your video game
Hey, that was great
That was the right thing to do
We have to expand
Sure
Mark
Is he mad about something
Okay, we are expanding to Yale and Columbia
Chris, you're gonna be in charge of publicity and outreach,  and you could start by getting a story in the BU student newspaper
It's The Bridge
They hate doing stories about Harvard
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg will do 10 hours of free programing
Why do you want a story in the BU newspaper
Because I do
Eduardo is CFO and owns 30% of the company
Dustin is vice president and head of programing,  and his 5% of the company will come from my end
Chris is director of publicity,  and his compensation will depend on how much work he ends up doing
Who are the girls
Sorry
They're Christy and Alice
Hi
Hi
Hi
Is there anything we can do
No, that's it
Yale and Columbia, let's go
What
Stanford
It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto
You don't want any lunch
You're welcome to some salad
No, thank you
This must be hard
Who are you
I introduced myself when we first..
I mean, what do you do
I'm a secondyear associate at the firm
My boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition phase
What are you doing
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia
They don't have roads, but they have Facebook
You must really hate the Winklevosses
The Winklevi aren't suing me for intellectual property theft
They are suing me because for the first time in their lives,  things didn't work out the way they were supposed to for them
He's expanding
He's expanding to Yale, Columbia and Stanford
It's gonna be in The Crimson tomorrow
Really
Yep
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief and get the site taken down now
Every minute the site is up, Harvard Connection becomes less valuable
I want an injunction
I want damages
And I want him dead
Yeah, I want those things, too
Then why aren't we doing anything about it
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard
No, it's because you're not thinking how it's gonna look
How's it gonna look
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law
When he goes to Connecticut, New York and California,  he'll have violated federal law
And, by the way, he's in violation of Harvard law
There's no such thing as Harvard law
Wait
Yeah, there is
Every freshman is issued one of these, and somewhere in this book it says...  You can't steal from another student
We're going to Summers
Well, you can't get a meeting with Larry Summers
My brother and I, we pay tuition at this school
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school
We've won trophies for this school
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics for this school
I want a meeting with the goddamn president of this school
Why do you think
I'm sorry
Okay
You don't know my name, do you
Is it Stanford
How do you go to a party and you meet someone...  Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy
You're from Orinda
Your father's in commercial real estate and your mother's 10 years sober
Trombone
Really
I remember something about a trombone
French
Your major's French
Mine
I don't have one
You haven't declared
I don't go to school
You're kidding
No
Well, where did you go to school
Seriously
You're not like 15 years old or anything, are you
No
Wait, you're not like 15, are you
I'm an entrepreneur
You're unemployed
I wouldn't say that
What would you say
That I'm an entrepreneur
Well, then, what was your latest preneur
Well, I founded an Internet company that let folks download and share music for free
Exactly like Napster
I founded Napster
Sean Parker founded Napster
Nice to meet you
You're Sean Parker
You see, the shoe's on the other..
Foot
Table, which has turned
You just slept on Sean Parker
You're a zillionaire
Not technically
What are you
There's not a lot of money in free music,  even less when you're being sued by everyone who's ever been to the Grammys
This is blowing my mind
I gotta hop in the shower and get ready for class
Biochem, even though you're a French major whose name is Amy
You passed
I'm a hard worker
There's juice or anything else you can find
Help yourself
You mind if I check my email
Amy
Amy
Can you come out here
Yeah
Just a second
There's a snake in here, Amy
What
Where
Are you kidding me
How
By running too fast and getting twisted in the curtain
What do you need to ask me
Yeah, I went to check my email and there's a website open on your computer
Yeah, after you passed out last night I went on The Facebook for a little bit
The Facebook
Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now
It's really awesome, except it's freakishly addictive
Mind if I send myself an email
Yeah, is everything okay
Everything's great
I've never been in this building before
This building's 100 years older than the country it's in, so do be careful
We're sitting in chairs
Yes
Very good
You can go in now
That's their own stupidity
I should've been there
Catherine, I've got students in my office now
Students
Undergrads
From the looks of it, they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise
All right, byebye
Good morning
Good morning, sir
I'm Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler
Either of you can answer
I'm sorry, sir, I thought you were reading the letter
Well, we came up with an idea for a website called Harvard Connection...  We've since changed the name to ConnectU
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea..
I understand
And I'm asking what you want me to do about it
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook, which is distributed to each freshman,  under the heading "Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community,"  it says the college expects all students to be honest and forthcoming  in their dealings with members in this community
Yes, sir
Punch me in the face
Go ahead
...or unauthorized use will result in disciplinary action,  including the requirement to withdraw from the college
And you memorized that instead of doing what
And you've spoken to your House Master
Yes, sir
And the House Master made a recommendation to the Ad Board,  but the Ad Board won't see us
Have you tried dealing with the other student directly
He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland,  and the closest I've come to dealing with him facetoface  is when I saw him on the quad and chased him through Harvard Square
You chased him
I saw him and I know he saw me
I don't see this as a university issue
Of course this is a university issue
There's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both
You enter into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other
I'm devastated by that
What my brother means is, if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room  and stole our computer, that would be a university issue
This office doesn't handle petty larceny
This isn't petty larceny
This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars
Millions
Yes
You might just be letting your imaginations run away with you
Sir, I honestly don't think you're in any position to make that call
I'm in some position to make that call
Well, then I would suggest that you let your imaginations  run away with you on a new project
You would
Yes
Everyone at Harvard's inventing something
Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job
So I'll suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project
I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point
You don't have to be an intellectual property expert  to understand the difference between right and wrong
And you're saying that I don't
Of course I'm not saying that, sir
Really
Sir
Anne, how did they get this appointment
Let me tell you something, Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,  since you're on the subject of right and wrong
This action, this meeting, the two of you being here is wrong
It's not what Harvard saw in you
You don't get special treatment
We never asked...  Just start another project
Like we're making a diorama for a science fair
If you have a problem with that, Mr. Winklevoss...  We never asked for special treatment
...the courts are always at your disposal
Is there anything else I can do for you
Thank you very much for your time, sir
Broke your 335yearold doorknob
Eduardo, spring break, you and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York
Yes
What was the purpose of the trip
Well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings with potential advertisers
Who paid for the trip
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account I had set up a few months earlier
At this point, your $1,000 was the only money that had been put into the company
How did you feel the meetings went
Why
Mark was asleep
I was not asleep
Can I rephrase my answer
I wish he'd been asleep
So we're in 29 schools now, with over 75,000 members
People who go on The Facebook  tend to stay on longer than almost any other website
91% of people who try it once will come back
Now, if you'll allow me..
Excuse me one second
What sound is he making
It wasn't a tsk
It was...  Like a glottal stop
Almost a gag reflex
There was one more meeting scheduled for the New York trip
Yes, it was a dinner
It was set up through my girlfriend at the time
Would you say that Mark was excited about this meeting
Very
Look, they're not gonna card us
They might
I mean, look around
Tell him they're not gonna card us
Mark...  Are you gonna talk about ads again
Unless you're the ballet theater of Hartford,  the purpose of a business is to make a profit
It isn't a business yet
That's tough for me, 'cause my... Never mind
He's 25 minutes late
He founded Napster when he was 19
He can be late
He's not a god
He's 25 minutes late
I think Wardo's jealous
I was nervous
Why
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had done a search and I'd asked around
And he struck me as kind of a...  A wild card
Why
He crashed out of two pretty big Internet companies in spectacular fashion,  he's had a reputation with drugs..
We don't need him
He's here
No, no, take your time
Stop it
I'm Sean Parker
How do you do
You must be Eduardo
And Christy
Great to meet you
You guys don't have anything in front of you
No
Tori
We were waiting
Can you bring out some things
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit
Tuna tartare
And the lobster claws, that'll get us started
Christy, what do you like to drink
Great
Four of those
From that point on, it was a Seanathon
The question was, "What did you talk about?
He took us through his episode with Napster
Who knew
The music industry doesn't have a sense of humor
We tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in royalties,  but I guess to them that was a little like selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy
And you are dry
Tori
No, no, I'm good
And then he went on to his second business venture,  which was an online Rolodex that he got thrown out of by Case Equity
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes, but nobody wants to take orders from a kid
So let me tell you what happens to a 20yearold at the top of a hot dotcom
I'm not a psychiatrist, but..
You're not a psychiatrist, but what
A psychiatrist would say that he was paranoid
They'll hire private detectives who'll follow you day and night
I can't prove it, but I know they tap my phones
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up, you've done already
Private behavior is a relic of a time gone by
And if somehow, someway, you've managed to live your life like the Dalai Lama,  they'll make shit up
Because they don't want you, they want your idea
And they want you to say "thank you" while you..
...wipe your chin and walk away
That's what happened to you
And delusional
Yes
I brought down the record companies with Napster  and Case'll suffer for their sins, too
Sorry, you didn't bring down the record companies
They won
In court
Yeah
And he told story after story about life in Silicon Valley,  and parties at Stanford and down in LA, and friends who'd become millionaires..
He had to come to California
And then he got around to The Facebook
So, tell me about your progress
Well, we're in 29 schools now
We got over 75,000 members
Okay
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,  but Baylor already had a social network on campus
So instead of going right after them,  we made a list of every school within 100 miles...  You put The Facebook on those campuses first
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw their friends on our site and we were in
It's called the Little Bighorn
That's smart, Mark
Easy
Hey, you know what
Settle an argument for us
I say it's time to start making money from The Facebook,  but Mark doesn't want advertising
Well..
The Facebook is cool, that's what it's got going for it
Yeah
You don't wanna ruin it with ads because ads aren't cool
Exactly
It's like you're throwing the greatest party on campus  and someone's saying it's gotta be over by 11:00
That's exactly right
Exactly
How big it can get, how far it can go
This is no time to take your chips down
You know what's cool
You
"A billion dollars.
And that shut everybody up
A billiondollar valuation
Unless you take bad advice, in which case you may as well have come up with  a chain of very successful yogurt shops
When you go fishing, you can catch a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish
You ever walk into a guy's den and see a picture of him standing next to 14 trout
No, he's holding a 3,000pound marlin
That's a good analogy
But we all know marlins don't really weigh 3,000 pounds, right
Have you seen the big ones up close
No, but I don't think the guy's holding a marlin the size of a Range Rover
That would be a really big fish and a very strong guy
You think we might be getting away from the point
I'm just a fan who came to say hi
He owned Mark after that dinner
He picked up the check, he told Mark they'd talk again soon,  and he was gone
But not before he made his biggest contribution to the company
Just "Facebook.
It's cleaner
Shit
Yeah
That's gotta be some kind of land speed record for talking
You wanna end the party at 11:00
I'm trying to pay for the party
There won't be a party unless it's cool
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The.
I meant to catching the marlin instead of the 14 trout
Doesn't that sound good
If you're a trout
Incorporation papers for Facebook, an LLC registered in Florida
Why Florida
It's where my family lives
Yeah, we stipulate
And that was April 13th, 2004
You can mark it
You have anything here
Yes
Thank you
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything  that might be considered legitimate grounds for termination
No
No
No
You were accused of animal cruelty
Wait
You weren't
This is not happening
I can't have this, Wardo
Come on, man
This is bullshit
I'd gotten into the Phoenix
I'd been accepted, and as part of my initiation I had to,  for one week, carry with me at all times and take care of a chicken
They identify you as one of the founders of Facebook
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."  I'm not the expert, but being connected to torturing animals  is probably bad for business
I did not torture the chicken
Are you crazy
No, and settle down, please
I have here an article from The Crimson..
This is scathing
956
This was college
Somebody's gonna have to answer for this
969
And the dining hall was serving chicken for dinner,  and I had to feed my chicken, so I...  Well, I took little pieces of chicken and I gave it to the chicken
Someone must have seen me, because the next thing I knew  I was being accused of forced cannibalism
I dealt with the various animal rights groups,  I dealt with the associate dean of the college
988
Someone from the Porc or the Fly must have reported it
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses
All right, let's just forget about it
This is absurd
I'm being accused of animal cruelty
It is better to be accused of necrophilia
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody
What is happening on that
I have my final coming up for Postwar and Contemporary Art  and I haven't been to class
I'm supposed to write about these four paintings
Yeah
I opened it under an alias
I posted the paintings and asked people to comment
Every once in a while, I hop on and stir the pot to get a good debate going
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating on his final exam
And why not
Because I'm not suing him for cheating on his final exam
That's not what friends do
Well, you just told us he was cheating
Oops
You told your lawyers I was torturing animals
No, he didn't tell us about it at all
In fact, when we raised the subject with him, he defended you
Oops
993
Yeah, that reminds me, we're gonna need more money, Wardo
More servers, more help
I'm interviewing two interns to come to Palo Alto  and we're gonna have to pay them something
Sorry, what
I already found a house for rent  on a street two blocks from the Stanford campus
It is perfect and it's got a pool
When did you decide to go to California for the summer
You mean when did I actually decide
He was right, California's the place we've gotta be
What, you're Jed Clampett
Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius
What is your problem with Sean
He doesn't bring anything to the table
He doesn't have money
He's got connections to VCs
We don't need VCs, we need advertisers
And I have connections to VCs
And as somebody who's just really embarrassed the company in a bad way..
It was the Winklevosses, Mark
Hang on
Hit "Refresh.
150,004
150,000 members, Wardo
Congratulations
You don't think it was strange that he was followed by private detectives
Who came up with nothing
Enough to get him out of the company
The drugs, the girls
You can read about it
I can read about you torturing birds
Since when..
The marlins and the trout
What's he talking about
I'm interviewing interns at 10:00 tomorrow night in the CS lab
You know, I don't really know what else to say
You can do one more
One more
Wardo
Yo
Mark
What's going on
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator
But here's the beauty
You know I didn't understand anything you just said, right
I do know that
So what's the beauty
Every tenth line of code written, they have to drink a shot
Hacking's supposed to be stealth, so every time the server detects an intrusion,  the candidate responsible has to drink a shot
The last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot
Plus, every three minutes they all have to drink a shot
Three minutes
Drink one now
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's job will they need to be able to do drunk
A more relevant test might be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week
That was mean
What is this
I opened a new account and put $18,000 in it
Will that get you through the summer
Here
Mark
Right here
$18,000
Yes
In addition to the $1,000 you'd already put up
A total of $19,000 now
Yes
I'm just checking your math on that
Yes, I got the same thing
May I continue
After expressing misgivings about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company  and moving it to California for the summer,  why did you put $18,000 in an account for his use
I figured we were partners
I wanted to be a team player
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns could work on the site  while I was generating advertiser interest in New York
Go, go, go, go, go
I didn't die
I made it
You did
Okay, ready
That was like an 8
That was like a 2
Yeah
I'm okay
Yeah
Yikes
That's the doorbell
I didn't know we had a doorbell
No, he's wired in
That's gonna cut into your security deposit
Andrew
Not now
Sean
Mark
Do you live here
Yeah
Do you
We were right across the street
No
You live across the street
I'm Sharon
She lives across the street
I was helping her move out, we saw the chimney...  We had a zip line to the pool
You came to California
Yeah
Here you go
Sharon
I'm so sorry
I didn't know you were gonna..
Here you go
No, no, no
Wait
This house and this team are great
I'm Sean Parker
Oh, he's wired in
Where's Eduardo
He got an internship in New York
Eduardo didn't come out
I was crashing there for a little bit while I'm taking care of some things,  but she's done for the summer so she's back at her parents' place
The homeless rock star of Palo Alto
What's your plan for the summer
Mark
I'm sorry
I was looking at the architecture
I asked what your plan for the...  A hundred schools by the end of the summer
Okay
Yeah, I'll go with you
She looks familiar to a lot of people
What do you mean
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond wants to buy his wife some lingerie,  but he's too embarrassed to shop for it in a department store
He comes up with an idea for a highend place  that doesn't make you feel like a pervert
He gets a $40,000 bank loan, borrows another 40,000 from his inlaws,  opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret
Makes a half million dollars his first year
Happy ending, right
Except two years later, the company's worth $500 million,  and Roy Raymond jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife a pair of thighhighs, you know
Was that a parable
My date's a Victoria's Secret model
God
Don't be impressed by all this
I read your blog
You know why I started Napster
The girl I loved in high school was with the cocaptain of the varsity lacrosse team,  and I wanted to take her from him
So I decided to come up with the next big thing
I didn't know that
I changed the music industry for better and for always
It may not have been good business, but it pissed a lot of people off
And isn't that what your Facemash was about
They're scared of me, pal, and they're gonna be scared of you
What the VCs want is to say,  "Good idea, kid, the grownups will take it from here.
But not this time
This time, you're gonna hand them a business card that says,  "I'm CEO, bitch.
That's what I want for you
So where the hell is Eduardo
Sucking up to ad execs
He's got an...  An internship
The company's here
A billiondollar company's here
Do you live and breathe Facebook
I know you do
Wardo wants to be a businessman and for all I know he's gonna be a good one,  but he shouldn't be in New York kissing Madison Avenue's ass
This is a onceinageneration, "holy shit" idea
Look at my face and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about
Do you ever think about that girl
What girl
No
If you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth, we need shots
A hundred schools by the end of the summer
Yeah
Tell you what
While you're getting into 100 schools, I'll put you on two continents
Two..
Let's line up some shots
Excuse me
Yes, sir
You can take this away and bring back the 1942
Absolutely, Mr. Parker
Attention... Go
At the barrier, Hollandia is leading Harvard University by one length
Come on
Whatever
Mr. Winklevoss
Tremendous race
Thank you
And this is my brother, Cameron
Sir
His Royal Highness Prince Albert
Your Highness, this is Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss
Brilliant race
I've never seen a race that close
Yes, Your Highness
My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one of the premier rowers of his day
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years and I'd never seen a race that close
Have you seen a race that close
No, Your Highness
Yes, that's absolutely right
Brutally close
May I introduce my teammates
I'm sorry
You'll have to excuse us
On to the Dutch
Sorry you flew all the way out here to see that
Wouldn't have missed it, brother
I just wanted him to tell me a couple more times how close the race was
Just brutal, brutally close
Jesus
The guy is the prince of a country the size of Nantucket
Boys
Divya
Dad
Mr. Winklevoss
That was a tough beat
I'm sorry that you and Mom had to fly out here to see that
Don't ever apologize to anyone for losing a race like that
Boys
Mr. Kenwright
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright, head of the host family for this week
Pleasure to meet you
Good to meet you
She told me that she and her friends are already talking about the race,  which they've just seen via their computers
A new website called Facebook
Do you have this in America
I'm gonna find your mother
Your daughter doesn't go to school in the States
No, no
Cambridge
And they have Facebook at Cambridge
And apparently Oxford and the London School of Economics
That's where her friends are
That's awesome
Take the bitter with the better, eh
I'm gonna go watch the race film
If this is online, I wanna see it
Stop it
Knock it off
I don't mind that we lost to the Dutch today by less than a second
That was a good race, and that was a fair race
And they'll see us again
What I mind, and what you should mind,  is showing up on Monday for a race that was run on Sunday
Come on
I need a real drink
Screw it
Let's gut the frigging nerd
That's what I'm talking about
But check it out, I saw him today
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham, my Case Equity guy
Hang on
Are you guys using Spikes or Ghost Missiles
We don't know, we're just shooting at each other
Use Sweet Kamikazes
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera and he saw me, too
I know he did
Don't sweat it
I'm on a landline
Bong hit
Does anybody hear that banging
You don't hear anything
Dude, somebody's at the door
It's not a dish best served cold
It's best served immediately and relentlessly
I'm gonna call you back
Mark was supposed to pick me up at the airport an hour ago
I've been calling his cell
What happened here
Not happened
Happening
The next big thing
Hey, man
Back to work
Okay
The more bad I get at this, the more wasted I get
I mean the more wasted that I get...  We understand
How old are they, Sean
Sean, how old are they
You think you know me, right
I've read enough
You know how much I've read about you
Nothing
Wardo
I waited an hour for you at the airport
It's midnight
Or 3:00 a.m
In New York, where I just came from
You gotta see some of the new stuff we got
Hey, Dustin
I'm just calling it the Wall
Forget the Wall, tell him about the meeting I've got set up
You know Peter Thiel
Nope
No reason you should
Why's he setting up meetings
Thiel might wanna make an angel investment
I don't care if he's an actual angel
Why is he setting up business meetings
No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK,  then a long wait at the passenger loading and unloading zone at SFO,  and in between there was a long flight
I'm the business end of this company
And he is a houseguest living here rent free  on a very generous grant from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation
I heard about your bigticket ad buys
Hey, man...  Harvard Bartending Course
You're just a small step away from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it
Sure
Bong hit
I'm so high
No, you're not
So how's it going
How's the internship
How's the internship
Yeah
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship
We talked about this on the phone
I do remember you saying that
So how is Christy
Christy's crazy
Is that fun
No
She's insanely jealous, she's irrational, and I'm frightened of her
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend
I do not want that guy representing himself as part of this company
You gotta move out here, Wardo, this is where it's all happening
I'm afraid if you don't come out here, you're gonna get left behind
I want..
I need you out here
Please don't tell him I said that
What did you just say
It's moving fast
What did you mean
And Sean thinks we have...  Sean is not part of this company
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,  and we're in 160 schools, including five in Europe
I'm aware of that
We need more servers than I ever expected we'd need
We need more programmers and we need more money,  and he set up the Thiel meeting
He set up other meetings
Yes
Without me knowing anything about it
You're in New York
I'm in New York riding subways 14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers
And how's it going so far
What did you mean, "get left behind"
Can I help you
I'd like to freeze this bank account  and cancel all existing checks and lines of credit
May I see some ID, please
Yeah, sure, sorry
Sean, he'll be right with you
That's comforting
Hey, guys
Come on back
She offer you some waters
Oh, yeah
We're cool
Sean, how are you
Come on in
Hi
We took a look at everything, and congratulations
We're gonna start you off with a $500,000 investment
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware  and come up with a stock structure that allows for new investors
Now, let me ask you something
Who's Eduardo Saverin
Jesus Christ
You scared me
I need you to knock
When did you get back
And when were you gonna call me
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip and I was tired...  Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts
Did you know I sent 47 texts
I did, and I thought that was incredibly normal behavior
I brought you a present
Why does your Status say "single" on your Facebook page
What
Why does your Relationship Status say "single" on your Facebook page
And you just never bothered to change it
What
I don't know how
Do I look stupid to you
No, calm down
You're asking me to believe that the CFO of Facebook  doesn't know how to change his Relationship Status on Facebook
Go to hell
Take it easy
Not even remotely true, and I can promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts  don't care what anyone's Relationship Status is on Facebook
Please, open your present
Your phone does work
It's Mark
Okay, this is gonna be tricky
Open your present
This'll be your first
Yeah
You froze our account
I did
You froze the account
I had to get your attention, Mark
Do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company
Do you realize that your actions could have destroyed  everything I've been working on
Let me tell you the difference between Facebook and everybody else
We don't crash ever
If the servers are down for even a day, our entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed
Look...  Users are fickle
Friendster has proved that
Even a few people leaving would reverberate through the entire user base
That is the whole point
College kids are online because their friends are online  and if one domino goes, the other dominos go
Don't you get that
I am not going back to the Caribbean Night at AEPi
Holy shit
What is wrong with you
Did you like being a joke
Do you wanna go back to that
That was the act of a child, not a businessman,  and it certainly was not the act of a friend
You know how embarrassing it was for me to try to cash a check today
I am not going back to that life
Maybe you were frustrated
Yeah
I was
I'm sorry
I was angry, and maybe it was childish, but I had to get your attention
Wardo, I said I've got some good news
What is it
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment of half a million dollars
What
Half a million dollars
And he's setting us up in an office
They need your signature on some documents,  so you gotta get your ass on the first flight back to San Francisco
I need my CFO
I'm on my way
Wardo
We did it
Wardo
You're going back there already
Yes
Somebody stop her
Four documents
The first two are common stock purchase agreements,  allowing you to buy stock in the newly reincorporated Facebook,  as opposed to the old shares, which are now worthless
The third is an exchange agreement  allowing you to exchange the old shares for new shares,  and then finally a voter holding agreement
How many shares of stock will I own
Jesus Christ
That represents a 34.4% ownership share
Why the increase from the original 30%
I love working with business majors
I'm telling you
Economics
Right
You should know that Mark has already taken his percentage from 60 down to 51
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%
Sean Parker, 6.47%
I can live with that
And Peter Thiel, 7%
Would you like to use my pen
Eduardo
Eduardo
Yes
Would you read it back, please
Well, go ahead
"Counsel: 'And when you signed these documents,  "'were you aware that you were signing your own death certificate?"
No
It was insanely stupid of me not to have my own lawyers look over all the..
In all honesty, I thought they were my lawyers
I was your only friend
My father won't even look at me
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say anything to you after you signed the papers
There was a lot of handshaking, a lot of congratulations
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be  coming back to school for at least a semester,  so we were saying goodbye for a while
But you gotta come back
Somewhere around the end of November or early December
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party when we hit a million members
It's gonna be out of control
A million members
Remember the algorithm on the window at Kirkland
Yeah
Yeah, I'll be here
You sure about this
You're 20 minutes late
They're gonna pitch you
Case Equity is going to pitch you
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod, you're gonna nod,  and then you're gonna say, "Which one of you is Roth?
No, not Roth
Manningham
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?
And he'll say, "I am.
And then you say, "Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you."
Walk out
Okay
It said that we had to have a business meeting
That Mark and Sean had played some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,  and that Manningham was so impressed  that he was now making an investment offer that was hard to turn down
So I went to California, and I went straight to the new offices
I didn't know whether to dress for the party or for the business meeting,  so I kind of dressed for both
But it didn't matter
Because I wasn't called out there for either one
What were you called out there for
An ambush
Mr. Saverin
Hey
Hey, man
How are you
How are you
Good, good, good, good, good
Good to see you
At first I thought he was joking
Giving me more contracts to sign
Wait, what is this
Well, as you know, we had some new investors that have come in
What is this
Mark
Mark
He's wired in
Sorry
He's wired in
Is he
Yes
How about now
Call security
You issued 24 million new shares of stock
How much were his
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's ownership share diluted down to
It wasn't
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share diluted down to
It wasn't
What was Sean Parker's ownership share diluted down to
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share diluted down to
And what was your ownership share diluted down to
.03%   You signed the papers
You set me up
It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook
It won't be like you're not a part of Facebook
You're not a part of Facebook
My name's on the masthead
You might wanna check again
This because I froze the account
You think we'd let you parade around in your ridiculous suits,  pretending you were running this company
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's
Security's here
I'm not signing those papers
We will get the signature
Tell me this isn't about me getting into the Phoenix
You... You did it
I knew you did it
You planted that story about the chicken
I didn't plant that story
You had me accused of animal cruelty
Seriously
What the hell's the chicken
And I'll bet what you hated the most  is that they identified me as a cofounder of Facebook
You better lawyer up, asshole
'Cause I'm not coming back for 30%
I'm coming back for everything
Get him out of here
Hang on
Almost forgot
Here's your $19,000
I wouldn't cash it, though
I like standing next to you, Sean
It makes me look so tough
Well...  That's it, that's our show for tonight, people
We're gonna walk into that club like it's the Macy's Parade
We've gotta almost be there
You all right
Yeah
You were kind of rough on him
You know you didn't have to be that rough on him
Listen, I put him...  Sean
You didn't have to be that rough on him
He almost killed it
I'll send flowers
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma
Ashleigh's a sister
The intern
Yeah
I know who she is
Are you guys...  Ashleigh
Me
Why
No
Nothing, I just..
Excuse me
Mark
We were just talking about you
Just that you're doing a really good job
Thanks
Put them on my desk
What's the package
Nothing
Mackey
Refresh
Sweet
And you're not a hugger
I know
One million
Who's got champagne
Huh
The next transformative development, a picturesharing application
A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life
It is the true digitalization of real life
You can use a CD
You don't just go to a party anymore
You go to a party with a digital camera, and then your friends relive the party online
And tagging
The idea...   Would this be easier without the bra
It's worth finding out
The party's over
Everybody, go home
I've spent hours watching what people do when they log on
Wait
That's weird
Check to see which one of their friends  changed their profiles, changed their photos..
Seriously, what happened to the music
We lived on farms and then we lived in cities,  and now we're going to live on the Internet
Sean, stop
I think something's going on downstairs
It's time for you to go home
The party is over
Then it's all good
It's the cops
What
Shit
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit
Okay, it's okay
Good to see you, Officer
What can I do for you
What's going on
Was the music too loud
We were having a celebration
Miss, I need you to button your blouse
Okay, we're gonna need identification
Keep your hands where we can see them
Oh, my God
You got anything else in your pockets I should know about
No, sir
Don't be stupid, now
I don't, I don't
What's this
That's an EpiPen
And this
That's my inhaler
Twentyone
Twentyone
Lying only makes it worse
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied
Hello
Shit
No, it's all right
It's gonna be all right
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing anything
I mean, I've got allergies
Interns
It was just a party
This is gonna be news, Sean
I know
I have it under control
I will get it under control
I will call someone and see what the next move is
But this is gonna be news now
I mean, do you think...  No
Or Manningham
One of them
Somebody
Somebody sent the coke in there, because it got in there
You believe me
God, this is gonna be fine
Go home, Sean
Mark
We're done for the day
Yeah
Yeah, I was just sitting here
What happened to Sean
All you had all day was that salad
Do you wanna get something to eat
I can't
I'm not a bad guy
When there's emotional testimony, I assume 85% of it is exaggeration
And the other 15
Creation myths need a devil
What happens now
Sy and the others are having a steak on University Avenue
Then they'll come back up to the office,  and start working on a settlement agreement to present to you
Oh, yeah
And you're gonna have to pay a little extra
Why
So that these guys sign a nondisclosure agreement
They say one unflattering word about you in public, you own their wife and kids
I invented Facebook
I'm talking about a jury
What a jury sees when they look at a defendant
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likeability...  Likeability
Watch what else
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party that night
You think I'm the one that called the police
Doesn't matter
I asked the question, now everybody's thinking about it
You've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes
Farm animals
I was drunk and angry and stupid
And blogging...  And blogging
Pay them
In the scheme of things,  it's a speeding ticket
I can't imagine it would be a problem
Thanks
I appreciate your help today
You're not an asshole, Mark
You're just trying so hard to be
 Baby, your a rich man  "Baby, You're A Rich Man by The BEATLES"  Where have you been
Get in
I had to find fireworks
Let me drive
Get in
Are you coming or not
It's too crowded
I thought you were starving
Let's go someplace quiet
Okay
Sitting
Listening to music
<i> You seem weird
Is everything okay
Yeah, everything's fine.</i>  It's July
How many shirts are you wearing
I'm cold
You're cold on the Fourth of July
What
"Fuck off and die"
Was that car at the drivein
I saw that car at Mr. Ed's
Do you want me to tell him to leave
Stay in the car
Was that your husband
No
Don't tell me not to worry
Who was it
It's nothing

Horrid
I'm thinking we go with not so horrid
That's a crime
Have you seen her
Wouldn't kid you
It may be the beginning of a crime wave
Go get the publisher
<i>"Dear Editor,</i>  "This is the murderer  "of the two teenagers last Christmas at Lake Herman  "and the girl on the Fourth of July near the golf course in Vallejo
<i>"To prove I killed them,</i>  "I shall state some facts which only I and the police know

"The boy was on his back with his feet to the car
"The girl... "  <i>Would you read that, please?</i>  <i>"The girl was on her right side, feet to the west.</i>  "Fourth of July

He wants his code in the afternoon edition
<i>If the Examiner doesn't have the balls to run it, we scoop the Bay.</i>  <i>Al, this man is talking about shooting 12 people.</i>  And not running this might make him do that
<i>If we run it, we might be setting a very dangerous precedent.</i>  <i>Oh, come on, now, it's newsworthy.</i>  <i>Well, giving some sick bastard a soapbox,</i>  what does that say to people

What dangerous animal
How do I know that
<i> Paul
Very well.</i>  Another letter
More of the same
Details about the murders
He taped a flashlight to the gun
That's how he hit them in the dark
And he gave himself a name
<i>But at some point,</i>  the county decided that the land would work better as a lake
So they flooded it
But there's an entire...  Hidden city under the water
It is a public park
I think he's watching us
<i>Well, we're very goodlooking.</i>  Where'd he go
He went behind that tree
All right
He's coming towards us
<i>Oh, my God, he has a gun.</i>  Don't move
I want your money and your car keys
<i>We're not gonna do anything, okay?</i>  We're gonna cooperate
Here
You're welcome to everything I have
If there's anything else I could do for you...  Maybe I could write you a check
<i>Okay, I could give you my phone number.</i>  <i>You know, I might be able to help you.</i>  Even more than you might think
He's a sociology major
<i>Prelaw, actually.</i>  <i>Oh, keys.</i>  <i>You know, I'm sorry, I don't know exactly where I put my keys.</i>  They might be on the blanket
Here's the keys
Don't get up
Okay
<i>You know, if he comes any closer, I might be able to get that gun.</i>   Don't get any ideas
I'm not
I killed a guard escaping from prison in Montana
<i>I'm not doing anything, okay?</i>  I'm not afraid to kill again
Look away
<i>Hey, you said it was in Montana, right?</i>  I'm taking your car
I'm going to Mexico

<i> What do you mean, like teriyaki

<i>Evening, gents
What a lovely night for a botched robbery.</i>  <i>Yeah, third this week
Dousette pronounced him at 10:10
Suspect fired one shot to the back of the head
Driver's wallet and car keys are missing
<i>Leroy, there, came down from Yellow Cab to ID him.</i>  <i>Neighborhood's pretty highend for this kind of thing,</i>  so I already set up transpo for the cab
Coroner's here
Kids who called it in saw the suspect from that window
Did they hear a shot
No
<i>They first saw him in the front seat,</i>  thought he was a drunk fighting with the driver
<i>Oldest kid ran downstairs to get a better look from the dining room,</i>  <i>described him as a white male, glasses,</i>  <i>crewcut, stocky, and wearing a dark jacket.</i>  <i>Wait, I thought someone said he was black.</i>  That's the description that went out to radio cars
Oh, well, that's good.</i>   You guys need anything else
No
Get out of here
Thanks
Happy Birthday
<i> Wait, it's your birthday
Happy birthday
Thanks
<i> Body or scene
It's your birthday, I'll take the body.</i>  <i>Dave, looks like he wiped the cab down pretty good.</i>   We got some blood over here
Could very well be
We'll dust it at the Hall
<i>The odd thing is, we also got gloves.</i>   Suspect's
<i> Hey, Pete
Yeah, Dave.</i>  <i>You through over there, can I get in there?</i>  <i>Yeah, I'm all set.</i>   Who rolled him
Stewarts
<i>Yeah, Luger.</i>  Nothing from the crowd
<i>Okay
I'm your shooter, Negro male adult,</i>  <i>who also happens to be a stocky, crewcut Caucasian.</i>  I flag a cab
I give him this address
Did I give him this address
Right here
Washington and Maple
<i>Lighting's the same over here,</i>  so maybe I see someone walking their dog
You don't want any witnesses so you tell him to go down a block
He pulls over
I wait for him to put it in park because I'm smart  and I don't want him hitting the accelerator  when I shoot him
<i>He stops, puts it in park, boom.</i>  <i>I shoot him on the right side, he slumps right?</i>  Maybe you've got your hand on his collar when you shoot
<i>All right
So, either way,</i>  I just dumped a quart of blood in the front seat
<i> So, why do you get in the front seat
For the money.</i>  But he's dead
<i>You could just reach over the seat, pull out his wallet.</i>  You don't have to go anywhere near the blood
<i>So, why'd he get in the front seat?</i>   I'm an idiot
You waited for him to put it in park
<i> Right
Thank you
Yeah, sure.</i>   Can I see that
I am an idiot
It's his third fare of the night
Does anyone have any animal crackers
Animal crackers
They're in the car
I'm saving those for later
Fine
<i> Are you a reporter
They just saw a man murdered
I understand
It looked like they were drunk and fighting
Did you get a chance to see his face
I did
Normal
Yeah
"Normal?
<i>"To prove this, here is a bloodstained piece of his shirt.</i>  "I am the same man who did in the people in the North Bay Area
"The S.F

Paul
Where's the shirt
<i>Right there, boss.</i>  There's your rag the kids talked about
<i> Is this on the record
Well, what do you think?</i>  He confirms the Vallejo and Napa killings
Gets worse
"School children make nice targets
"Just shoot out the front tire  "and then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out. 
<i>Jesus Christ, who's got school buses
Department of Transportation?</i>   School board
All right
I'm gonna need elimination prints from your staff

<i>On my way back to my desk
<i>I'll call Napa and Vallejo,</i>  get the letters up to Sherwood in Sacramento
<i>Dave, just one thing
Is it true they got a print off the cab?</i>  <i>Yeah, we got a partial in blood.</i>  <i> But that is not for publication
Hey, hey, come on.</i>  <i>Hey, it's me.</i>  Did he say they got a print
Partial
<i>Dude, he wears his gun like Bullitt.</i>  <i>No, McQueen got that from Toschi.</i>  Does he think that Zodiac's gonna send another code
'Cause I think Zodiac's gonna send another code
<i>Jesus Harold Christ on rubber crutches, Bobby.</i>  What are you doing
<i>You're doing that thing, the thing we discussed,</i>  the thing that I don't like
Yeah.</i>  <i>In cooperation with SFPD, we will run the Zodiac letter</i>  without including the threat on school children
We don't want to start a citywide panic  so I'm asking all of you to please keep this confidential
Thank you
<i>I packed you your carrots and your soda and peanut butter, okay?</i>  <i> Dad, you don't have to wait with me
I know.</i>  <i>You know what
You know what
I'm gonna drive him today, okay?</i>  Come on
What's that
And that
It is you waiting in the hall if you speak again
Sorry
"Sorry" counts as speaking
There are similarities in the lowercase "r's. 
We have to release the bus threat
We're already screwed
We just went from "Routine Cabbie Shooting"  to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids. 
<i>The Zodiac Killer has come to San Francisco.</i>  <i>Confirmation tonight,</i>  <i>from the San Francisco Police Department</i>  <i>that in his latest haunting letter,</i>  <i>which takes credit for the murder of cab driver Paul Stine,</i>  <i>the Zodiac has threatened to, "Wipe out a school bus</i>  <i>"and pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out
"</i>  <i>If you think you might know who the Zodiac is,</i>  <i>you can call the San Francisco Police Department's newest tip line.</i>  Press conference is at 4:00
We got to give them something
What do we really got
We're swamped
You got any hard suspects
About 90 an hour
I'm up to around 500
Yeah, hold, please.</i>  We're gonna need to tell them we got the entire force on this
How many men can you give me
<i>Well, right now, it's you and Bill and Monday's a school day.</i>  <i>Yeah, I know, Chief
I have three daughters of my own.</i>  <i>Yeah, I know
Where's Armstrong?</i>  He's on the phone with Vallejo
<i>We're playing catch up, Jack.</i>  <i>I'd like to set up a meeting with your survivor, Michael Mageau.</i>  I can't
He skipped town
When he was still in the hospital we could show him lineups all day long
Why?</i>  I don't think he wanted to have anything to do with this
<i>Can you send us everything that you have?</i>  <i>Well, the road goes both ways.</i>  <i>Now, we need that print you lifted from the cab</i>  <i>and we should have been in on the handwriting.</i>  I apologize
Things have been moving fast
<i>Who should I talk to in Napa so we can coordinate?</i>  Talk to Ken Narlow
<i>I apologize
Things have been moving fast.</i>  <i>Listen, we're gonna need your scene photos.</i>  Can't help you
<i>Ken, I don't want to get into a jurisdictional thing here.</i>  <i>No, no, no, no, no
We didn't have a crime scene.</i>  The ranger that found the kids literally swept everything into a picnic blanket
<i>All we have are the Wing Walker prints.</i>  The what
Boot prints to and from the crime scene  <i>were made by size 10andahalf Wing Walkers,</i>  militarystyle boots sold only at military PXs  designed to walk on the wings of planes
<i>And you can't buy at a PX without a military ID,</i>  so our suspect could be military
<i> Yeah
Did Vallejo?</i>  I don't know
I don't work in Vallejo
Great
I'm gonna need photos of those boot prints
<i>Sure, if you send me the handwriting.</i>  I thought Questioned Documents already did
<i>Nope
Vallejo's got them, not us.</i>  All right
Forget it
We don't have telefax yet
<i> Okay, I'll put it in the mail
We'll mail ours, too.</i>  And call Mulanax in Vallejo
Maybe he can get you a mimeo
Right
Why don't you just get a photo off the original plaster cast
<i>We'd have to wait, because they don't have a fax.</i>  <i>We don't have a fax, either.</i>  <i>Look, I'm just trying to get us coordinated.</i>  Have you called Solano Sheriff's Office
Why would I call Solano
Bill
Can I have a word with you
Where did you see this guy
We got the call to circle the scene and look for a Negro male adult
Where was he
On Jackson
Heading east
About the middle of the block
And this is three minutes after the shooting
Give or take
Yeah
And you were heading east or west
Correct
Did you slow down
Of course we slowed down
All right
<i>Listen, Dispatch said it was a Negro male.</i>  That was corrected
<i>No, but at the time they hadn't changed it.</i>  This guy was white
<i>Right, not in a hurry
What do you mean, "lumbering"?</i>   Shuffling
Stocky
Had a crew cut
<i>Yeah, that's all correct.</i>  <i>Listen, it was dark.</i>  The guy was wearing a dark jacket
There's no way..
Did you stop him
Yes
No
No
You need to get with a sketch artist
We have to put out a new composite right away
No looming
Have you considered the water theory
<i>Geographically, every attack takes place near a body of water</i>   or a waterbased name
This is your water theory
Lake Berryessa
Blue Rock Springs
Lake Herman
Washington and Cherry
You think
No
... and he says you look for patterns,</i>   so I'm looking for patterns
No
Why not
You got four crime scenes
<i>Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa, and here.</i>  Not a single usable print at the first three or in any of the letters
How does our master criminal come to the city and leave a bloody latent
<i>I mean, assuming the gloves are his,</i>  he shoots the cabbie and then takes them off
<i>So it's not his print?</i>  <i>Maybe, maybe not
They both die
<i>From there on out, he only manages to kill the girls.</i>   Not for lack of trying
Not for lack of trying
Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.</i>  He gets so caught up with the women he forgets to finish off the men
<i>Plus, they're all couples and all on lover's lanes.</i>   Paul Stine is not
Exactly
<i>So, why does Zodiac kill him?</i>  He's breaking the pattern
Yeah
<i>Someone claiming to be Zodiac called Oakland PD a halfhour ago.</i>  <i>He says he's gonna call in on Jim Dunbar's morning show in three hours.</i>  On television
<i>He wants Melvin Belli on to counsel him.</i>  All right
All right
Let's go wake up Melvin
Glove box
Are these windows bulletproof
<i>Yes, Melvin
Are you sure you're up for this
<i>Don't you worry about me, Inspector
The man you're worrying about snuffing you out
<i>What are these, cookies?</i>  <i>Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?</i>   Shit
KGO must have tipped other stations
<i>Get him talking
Convince him to meet you somewhere.</i>  <i>If you see an opportunity,</i>  we want you to suggest Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown
You'll be tracing the call
Pacific Telephone says you need to keep him on the line for 15 minutes
Clear the set
<i>Here you go, you drunken reprobate.</i>  <i>We interrupt our regular program to bring you this news bulletin.</i>  <i>Welcome to this special edition of our show</i>  <i>in which we are joined by attorney Melvin Belli</i>  <i>who the Zodiac Killer personally requested to appear.</i>  <i>Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.</i>  <i> Good morning, Melvin
Good morning, Jim.</i>  <i>So, the phone lines are open
Mr. Belli is here.</i>  <i>Here to help, Jim.</i>  <i>Yes
Good people
<i>You know, I've often thought of becoming an actor fulltime.</i>  What was your character's name
<i> Gorgon
Gorgon
Get the tape
<i>Jim, we have a call
We're going live.</i>  Hello
Hello
This is Melvin Belli
Who am I speaking with
<i>This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  Is there something I can call you that's a little less ominous
<i>Sam.</i>  Sam
<i> Sam
Yes?</i>  Do you think you need medical care
<i>Medical, not mental.</i>  Do you have health problems
<i>I'm sick
<i>I have headaches, too,</i>  but a chiropractor stopped them a week ago
<i>I think I can help you, Sam.</i>  Sam
<i>Sam, we'd like you to know that we are not tracing these calls.</i>  <i>It's a long, difficult process and ineffective with these short calls.</i>  Sam
We're not tracing these calls
<i>Okay.</i>  <i>Sam, you need to tell me what your problem is.</i>  <i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber.</i>  <i>I have headaches
I kill, I don't get them.</i>  That is fucked up
<i>You want to live, don't you
Well, this is your passport.</i>  <i>How long have you been having these headaches?</i>  <i>Since I killed a kid.</i>  <i> Do you have blackouts
Yes.</i>  <i> Do you have fits
No
<i>Yes.</i>  And why did you want to talk to Mr. Bailey
<i>Why do you wanna talk to me, Sam?</i>  <i> I don't want to be hurt
Why is he calling?</i>  <i> Hey, just a second, buddy
I wouldn't think they would ask for capital punishment
<i>We should ask the District Attorney.</i>  <i>Do you want me to do that, Sam?</i>  <i>Do you want me to talk to the District Attorney?</i>  <i>What was that, Sam?</i>  <i>I did not say anything.</i>  <i>We heard a scream.</i>  <i>That was my headache.</i>  You sound like you're in a great deal of pain
<i>My head aches
I'm so sick.</i>  <i>I'm gonna kill them.</i>  <i> Oh, okay
I'm gonna kill those kids!</i>  Fantastic
Just us
Okay.</i>  <i>How about Old St. Mary's Church in Chinatown?</i>  <i>No.</i>  <i>In front of the Daly City St. Vincent de Paul at 10:30.</i>  I'll see you there
<i>Take care of yourself, Sam.</i>  <i>My, my, my.</i>  You fellows certainly know how to put on a secret meeting
I have headaches.</i>  <i>I kill, I don't get them.</i>  <i>No, it's not him.</i>  It's the voice
The voice is too high
It's too young
<i>All right
I got it
They pulled off the trace
Our Daly City noshow called from a mental institution
Calmer
Might have actually been him
"So I shall change my way of collecting slaves
"I shall no longer announce to anyone when I commit my murders
"I look like the description passed out only when I do my thing
"The rest of the time I look entirely different
"I shall not tell you what my disguise consists of when I kill
<i>"As of yet I have left no fingerprints behind me,</i>  "contrary to what the police say
"I wear transparent fingertips
<i>"I enjoy needling the blue pigs
Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.</i>  "You were using fire trucks to mask the sound of your cruising prowl cars
<i>"Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up</i>  "to have your nose rubbed in your booboos
<i>"If you cops think I am going to take on a bus the way I stated I was,</i>  "you deserve to have holes in your heads. 
And you need to look at this
<i>"Take one bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer,</i>  <i>"one gallon of stove oil,</i>  "and dump a few bags of gravel on top... "   Okay
Okay
We gotta call the Army and see if this  science experiment could actually work
Another cipher
They arrived this morning
Are you planning to publish
Robert
We should have a drink
<i>So, tell me about yourself.</i>   You married
Divorced
Two kids
What do you do for fun
I love to read
I enjoy books
Why you been going through my trash
I'll come back to that
How did you know he was gonna send another code
I just guessed
The first one seemed too easy
<i>All right, this can no longer be ignored.</i>   What is that you're drinking
It's an Aqua Velva
You wouldn't make fun of it if you tried it
A married couple who like puzzles
So what's that tell us about the Zodiac
He's no expert
It's just a simple substitution code  like the one that we used to do as boy scouts
<i>"A" is one, "B" is two.</i>  <i>We weren't all boy scouts, Robert.</i>  <i>Well, it's not that hard
You just got to know where to start.</i>  In the first cipher...  You actually carry that around with you
Why
No reason
The double "L."  Double "L."  <i>And what's the one word that we know that he'll use in here, at least once?</i>  <i> "Kill. 
Right, "kill
"</i>  <i>So the Hardens start looking for double symbols,</i>  <i>which they find here, here, and here.</i>  Each with the same two symbols preceding them
So now they've got a repeating fourletter word  ending with two symbols that they assume stand for "L."  And since they think the whole word is "kill" then...  <i>Then you got your "K," you got your "I," and you're on your way.</i>  But how do you go from "A" is one and "B" is two  to figuring out this whole code
<i>Well, same way I did
You go to the library.</i>  <i>In this book,</i>  the author presents a very simple substitution code in the preface
Eight of the 26 symbols that he suggests are found in this cipher
<i>Yeah, but there are nonletter symbols</i>  because there's all these medieval ones
The Zodiac Alphabet
Jesus
What do you want out of this
What
What's your angle
This is good business for everyone but you
How do you mean "business"
Hey
I'll be up in a minute
<i> Hello
Bill?</i>  There's not many basements in California
<i>"Basement for future use

Yeah, sure.</i>  <i>"Dear Melvin, this is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  <i>"I wish you a happy Christmas.</i>  <i>"The one thing I ask of you is this
Please help me.</i>  "I cannot reach out for help because this thing in me won't let me. 
Thank you
"I am finding it extremely difficult to hold it in check  "and I am afraid I will lose control again  "and take my ninth and possibly tenth victim. 
<i>Melvin, he's reaching out to you.</i>  Absolutely
<i>Inspectors, he sent this letter directly to my residence.</i>  <i>It is a cry for help, intended as a private communiqué.</i>  <i>Which is why you contacted the Chronicle.</i>  The people have a right to know

Fascinating people

Back to the killer who wrote to you
Yes
Of course
It is my belief that he only penned this letter  because he couldn't get through to me on the Dunbar show or here
He tried to contact you here
<i>I was out, but he spoke with my housekeeper.</i>  Didn't leave a number
He's kind of crafty like that
Do you mind if I speak to her
Not at all
I'll be back
Yeah
She's right this way

No problem

Are you okay
Yeah, we're fine.</i>  Must have been worse than I thought

It's okay

<i>When I'm done with them, they don't need much help.</i>  It's okay
<i>Before I kill you,</i>  I'm gonna throw your baby out the window
No
Help
Please
No
She flagged me down
What happened to her
I found her like this

A woman and her baby abducted
Fact
<i> The car on fire
Okay, now,</i>  <i>look at the article from the Bee.</i>  Seen it yet
And he's done it before
<i>Officer Richard Radetich, shot sitting in his car.</i>  Zodiac claimed that he shot someone in their car
Couple days after this article came out
<i>Zodiac didn't do it, but took credit for it anyway</i>  because he's in it for the press
He even stole his symbol
What
Yeah
<i>If I show you something, you promise not to tell anyone?</i>   Who would I tell
Okay
Totally solid point
Okay
The guy stole his logo off a watch
How can somebody who's killed 13 people do...  <i>He claims he's killed 13 people,</i>  but which ones can we actually confirm
<i>There's three in Vallejo, one in Berryessa, the cabbie
That's it.</i>  <i>Bobby, you almost look disappointed.</i>  Chief's pulling everybody off buses

Maybe he's gone

Good evening
I'm looking for a Melanie

Yeah
I'm working with...   Do you know who Paul Avery is
Sounds kind of familiar
He's the writer that the Zodiac threatened
Where is Riverside
It's near L.A.  <i>Oh, wow
I don't think Paul knows that it's that far away.</i>  Sounds kind of dangerous
Yeah
<i>Well, you said it was an anonymous tip, right?</i>  Yeah
I mean, it could be the Zodiac.</i>  Don't you think it's kind of stupid
<i>Yeah, yeah
Well, Paul has a gun.</i>  <i>So, do you know what's good here?</i>  I've never been here before
<i>Yeah, I'll have the penne vodka
But could you do it in a cream sauce?</i>  Of course
Maybe give us another minute
Do you have any change
<i>Oh, wait, no wait, hold on.</i>  Nope

<i>In a bizarre twist, the hunted has become hunter.</i>  <i>San Francisco Chronicle reporter and Zodiac target Paul Avery</i>  <i>claims to have uncovered new information</i>  <i>regarding the only unsolved homicide in Riverside County's history,</i>  <i>a 1966 Southern California murder,</i>  <i>that Avery now believes was the Zodiac's first victim.</i>  What
He didn't call you about this
Hang on
<i>The Riverside killer wrote to the press letters</i>  <i>that I then took personally to the Office of Questioned Documents.</i>  <i>And what did this expert tell you?</i>  <i>What I knew in my gut, Ron.</i>  <i>The handwriting matches Zodiac's.</i>  How'd he get the evidence out of Riverside
<i>Hey, how do we know that this lead is real?</i>  It's very real
You know how I know
Because I saw it on TV
Dave
Hi
<i>Dave, you know Mel Nicolai
He's working the case for Justice.</i>  <i>Good to see you, Mel.</i>  <i>All due respect, can someone explain to me</i>  why I'm reading about breaks in this case  <i>in the Chronicle instead of getting calls from you?</i>  We got screwed

Cheri Jo Bates attended Riverside Community College
<i>Someone cut the coil in the distributor, the battery died.</i>  <i>The someone comes back, offers to help.</i>   Like Kathleen Johns
Who
<i>A woman outside of Modesto, might be a Zodiac victim.</i>  Might
Might be
Okay
<i>A typewritten confession was sent to the Riverside Press Enterprise</i>  <i>on November 29th, a month after Bates's murder.</i>  They ran it
"I'm not sick
I am insane
"This letter should be published for all to read. 
He wants to be published
He calls it a game
<i>I mean, this could be our boy.</i>  <i>Six months later, the police, the girl's father, and the paper,</i>  they all received these
Don
This was found a couple of months later by a janitor in RCC storage
Sherwood got a handwriting match off wood
Who etches in their own handwriting
<i>To be honest with you,</i>  <i>our letters and your letters, I don't see it.</i>  How did Paul Avery get his hands on the exemplars
I gave them to him
We talked on the phone the other day for about an hour
You told him we were meeting
Yeah
I also told him we don't think this is Zodiac
<i>Okay, wait a minute.</i>   You don't think this is Zodiac
We got a guy we like for it
<i>If you don't think this is Zodiac, then why give anything to Avery?</i>  I'm trying to cooperate
<i>Oh, that's how you cooperate
<i>Zodiac reads it in the paper, and he writes a letter taking credit for it.</i>  <i>Now, that's something he's done before.</i>  <i>Look, now you have everything we have.</i>  <i>But, in my opinion, you guys came south for nothing.</i>  <i>FUBAR, gentlemen, FUBAR.</i>  I don't care what he says
This still could be Z
The problem is the entire state already thinks it is
<i>Well, there's your press agent
Talk to him about it.</i>  I come in peace
I don't want any trouble
Not now.</i>  <i> Just trying to do my job
Well, now I can't do mine.</i>  <i>We're already screwed with the amount of tips we got on this thing,</i>  and you just freaked out the entire state
<i>I have got Napa, Vallejo, and DOJ looking at me sideways</i>  and Riverside's telling me I'm on a snipe hunt
<i>Jesus
I gave that to you.</i>  You and Armstrong never would have found her
This may not be Zodiac
Does that matter to you
What if it is
Does it matter that Riverside may not  be able to make a case against their suspect because of you
<i>Tell it to Sherwood
We're in this together
<i>No, we're not in anything together, Paul,</i>  because I'm not interested in upping my circulation
He wrote me
He threatened my life.</i>  <i>Hey, Bullitt!</i>  <i>Been a yearandahalf, you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?</i>   Go fuck yourself
Happily
<i>You should have called me, Paul.</i>  Thank you
<i> Did you see this
Unfortunately, yes.</i>  Here comes every lunatic in California
I'm the Zodiac
<i>With a gun
No, with a hammer.</i>  All I'm authorized to tell you  is that he's still under government employment
And who authorized you to tell me this
That's all I'm authorized to say
Zodiac didn't cut off any of the victims' hands
<i> Are you sure
Yes, sir.</i>  Travis and I worked here side by side for 10 years
His foot gets crushed in an accident and the killings begin
Coincidence
Do the math.</i>  Have you considered the killer might be Paul Avery
Frequently
<i>He was drinking Coors, getting a load on.</i>  Starts talking about hunting people
Like that book
Says how you can put a light at the end of a gun  to use as a sight in the dark
He said that
Yeah
"</i>  <i>And he said, "It would be easy</i>  "'cause there'd be no real motive to the thing. 
Then he said he'd write letters to the police  and call himself Zodiac to mess with them
Leigh liked messing with people
You're positive he said "Zodiac"
Yeah
So I told him
Did you feel like he'd been thinking about it a long time
He was raw about losing his job at the school
He talked about shooting out the tires of a school bus  and picking off the little darlings
He actually used those words
<i>Afterwards, I told my wife I didn't wanna see him again.</i>  And I haven't since
<i>Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.</i>  I know he's been up to that lake a bunch of times
Lake Berryessa
Couple times
We went fishing by Putah Creek near there
Tell him when you put it together
<i>About a year ago, in the paper, there was a story about the Zodiac.</i>  And it all comes back
I tried to call the local cops
They blew him off
Thought he was a nut
I started a new job in L.A. On January 20th
I had to move
<i> This is my problem
<i>I don't know
He's angry, he's been drinking,</i>  been thinking about it for a while

January 10th, 1970.</i>  He just got lost in the shuffle
Did Allen screw his wife or anything
We're gonna do a full background check
<i>But I got to tell you, I like this guy.</i>  <i>So, let's pull some handwriting samples.</i>  Hi
I talked to Sherwood
He got the samples
What are you having
BLT
There's not enough handwriting.</i>  <i>The application's got more, but it doesn't look like Z's,</i>  <i>so he can't rule him in
He needs more samples.</i>  <i>Also, our guy is a pervert.</i>  <i>When Mel got the application from Valley Springs,</i>  they told him that Allen had been fired for touching kids
Touching
Polite euphemism
Make some phone calls
Are you done with the fries
Go ahead
<i>Did you and Mr. Cheney have a chance</i>  <i>to look at the copies of the Zodiac letters we sent you?</i>  Yeah
Some of this stuff is pretty creepy
<i> Yeah, we know that
I mean, creepy like Leigh.</i>  He misspells words like that
What about the handwriting
<i>I don't know
Don't you have experts for that stuff?</i>  Our man at Questioned Documents says it's inconclusive
Maybe he did it with his other hand
He's ambidextrous.</i>  <i>He can write with either hand
Didn't you guys know that?</i>  <i>In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.</i>  <i>Job applications, letters to friends, et cetera.</i>  But he writes the Zodiac letters with his right hand  producing a different handwriting that he can't be linked to
<i>We got to see this guy, Chief.</i>   Where is he
<i>He works at Union Oil in Pinole
His brother's up there, too.</i>  See them both
Make sure you call Mulanax
It is his backyard
<i>Oh, right, because that worked so well for us in Riverside.</i>  <i>Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.</i>  <i>You can talk to him in here
Coke machine's busted, by the way.</i>  I'll go get him for you
<i>Well, Bill talked to the informants
<i>Mr
Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong.</i>  This is Inspector Dave Toschi and Sergeant Jack Mulanax
We're investigating the Zodiac murders in San Francisco and Vallejo
<i>Please, sit down.</i>  The informant notified us that you made certain statements  11 months prior to the first Zodiac murder
<i>If they're true, they're quite incriminating.</i>  Do you recall having any such conversation
No
When it was first in the paper
Why not
Too morbid
I..
I told all this to the other officer
Which other officer
From Vallejo
<i>No, but it was right after the murder at the lake.</i>  And what did you tell this officer
I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point that weekend to skin dive
That I was alone but I met a couple there
I have their names at home if you want them
<i>That would be great, Arthur.</i>   Leigh
What
Nobody calls me Arthur
<i>Also, that day when I came home, my neighbor saw me.</i>  It was around 4:00
Neighbor's name
Bill White
He died a week or so afterwards
Heart attack
So I didn't think to call to follow up
<i>The knives I had in my car with the blood on them,</i>  that blood came from a chicken that I killed for dinner
I had knives in my car that weekend
Maybe Bill saw them and called the other officer on me
<i>Well, we'll be checking in on that.</i>  <i>Well, let me ask you something else.</i>  Were you ever in Southern California at any time in 1966
Yes
<i>Well, I guess I was there around that time.</i>  I used to go down there a lot
I like the auto races
Informant says that you're ambidextrous
<i>My teachers tried to make me when I was a kid, but I couldn't.</i>  I'm lefthanded
He also said that you made statements about killing school children
That is... That's a horrible thing to say
<i>So, you weren't angry about being fired from Valley Springs</i>  for touching your students
I'm not the Zodiac
<i>And if I was, I certainly wouldn't tell you.</i>  That's a nice watch
Thank you
May I see it
Where'd you get it
It was a Christmas gift from my mother two years ago
<i>So, tell me something, Arthur.</i>  You don't remember anyone  you might have had a conversation with regarding the Zodiac
Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker at Vallejo Recreation
But I couldn't be positive
I used to work there when...  <i>The Most Dangerous Game.</i>  What
<i>The Most Dangerous Game
That's why you're here, isn't it?</i>  It was my favorite book in high school
<i>Because he was tired of hunting animals,</i>  he hunted the people for the challenge
And man is the most dangerous animal of all
That's the whole point of the story
Great book
<i>Or, at least, that's what I told Phil.</i>  May I go
I'm willing to help in any way possible
I look forward to the day  when police officers are no longer referred to as pigs
Thanks
We'll be in touch
These are copies of some of the Zodiac letters that were sent
We'd like you to take a look at them
You think my brother's the Zodiac
<i>Well, we're looking at him.</i>  Are you going to arrest him
<i>Mrs
Allen, we don't arrest people just because we're interested in them.</i>  <i>Well, Leigh's always been troubled.</i>  Is it true about the children
Unfortunately
What are your feelings about Don Cheney
Don Cheney
Was he the one who contacted you
That's confidential
<i>Well, Don's a very reliable guy.</i>  <i>If he were to tell you something, I'd believe it to be true.</i>   This one
What about it
"</i>  We got a Christmas card from Leigh a couple years ago
He spelled it the exact same way
Christmass
Would you still have that
Thank you
That'd be great
Is there anything else we can do to help
<i>The brother said he would search Leigh's apartment</i>  next time he went out of town
That gets you around a warrant
<i>If we do find something, Mulanax will go to the DA in Vallejo,</i>  and we could search the place properly
Now I got a chance to talk to the cop  who interviewed Leigh Allen two days after the Berryessa murders
But you do
I wish I could've taken the guy in there
<i>Take it slow, Dave
Try and find more stuff for Sherwood.</i>  A match'll get us farther on the warrants
Avery's on two
Tell him to screw
You want me to communicate that verbatim or can I spice it up a little
<i> Paul, I've been thinking...  Oh, God save us all.</i>  The letter to Melvin Belli  was sent exactly one year after the Lake Herman Road murder
And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father  was sent exactly six months after her death
She was killed a day before Halloween
Yeah
And you received a Halloween card...  <i>You know, these are all fascinating pieces of news, Robert,</i>  it's a bit early in the day
I didn't mean to wake you up
No, no, no.</i>  <i> I just thought that...  No, no, no.</i>  This suspect is not your Zodiac
Perfectly
<i>So we've just retested the left hand
I'm sorry
Just not gonna work
<i> Homicide, Toschi
Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.</i>  Hey
Mulanax
Yeah
<i>We struck out with the judge.</i>  <i>He won't sign off on a warrant for Allen's house.</i>   Why not
<i>Now, unless we bring him a handwriting match or some evidence that...</i>  How are we gonna get evidence if we can't toss the house
<i>I don't know.</i>  <i> I truly am sorry
No, no
Thank you, Jack.</i>  What do you wanna do
Don't know what I can do without Vallejo
We can't get it without a warrant
Are there other guys you should be looking at
<i>Only, what?</i>  Twentythree hundred
<i>Okay, then.</i>  <i>Okay, then.</i>  <i>Paul, you wrote the Justice Department</i>  asking to be put in charge of the Zodiac investigation
...that those with intimate knowledge of the case  create an information clearinghouse  to promote an exchange and free flow of ideas
Well, who better than me?</i>  The marked man
<i>Paul, if you want to work here, I need three things.</i>  <i>One, stop boozing.</i>  <i>Two, stop doing whatever else it is you're doing.</i>  <i>And three, cut this nonsense out.</i>  <i>Sweetest of Templetons, if at any time</i>  <i>you feel my excellent work is no longer in step with this trashy provincial rag,</i>  I'll more than happily...  More than happily decamp for greener pastures
<i>Paul, I mean it!</i>   Paul
Yep
What was that
An editorial têteàtête
It's 10:00 in the morning
Late breakfast
No
Thank you for asking
Shorty
Let's go out for one
<i>Paul, where are you going?</i>  <i>So, you moved off my brotherinlaw?</i>  We couldn't get a warrant
Last year we arranged for Leigh to get help from a social worker
He only went twice
My motherinlaw brought him by to see the new baby
Because of patient confidentiality..
The man said yes
Why hadn't you seen him in nine months
Santa Rosa
Where is he living
In his trailer
In Santa Rosa
Sonoma County
We wouldn't have to go through the Vallejo DA
<i>It's been 11 months since you talked to this guy,</i>  and now you wanna search his trailer
<i>If we find something, great.</i>  <i>If not, we get his prints and handwriting samples from both hands.</i>  I thought Sherwood shut you down
I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes
He trained me at this
Between you and me
Because there are differing schools of thought on this
If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.</i>  <i>That's the current thinking, according to Terry Pascoe.</i>  <i>Meanwhile, I spoke to a psychologist who'd be willing to testify</i>  that someone who undergoes a personality change like Zodiac  <i>would manifest it physically, altering his handwriting.</i>  Which is why Sherwood couldn't get a match from Allen's samples
<i>We got Terry Pascoe, this psychology guy,</i>  coupled with Cheney..
It could be enough for a warrant
Get Cheney on the record
"And that he would call himself Zodiac. 
Yes
<i>Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney
Thank you very much for your time.</i>  Thank you
<i>Lives in Sunset Trailer Court in Santa Rosa, California.</i>  Physical description
<i>Allen is similar in height, weight and build</i>  to a man seen at Lake Berryessa on the day of the stabbings
<i>I understand he doesn't look much like the San Francisco composite.</i>  <i>True
Height and weight are sketchy,</i>  but lumbering Caucasian with a crew cut is right on
We never had much confidence in the composite from the kids
The patrolman who saw Zodiac that night  said he didn't look much like the sketch
Allen was in the Navy
Wears a size 10andahalf
Same size as the prints found at Berryessa
<i>What about gun?</i>  Cheney says Allen owns several firearms
<i> And the ciphers
Could be code training in the Navy,</i>  and people have seen Allen with ciphers in the past
<i>Really
And Phil Tucker told us about a conversation that he had with Allen  about how to attach a flashlight to the barrel of a gun
That gives us two sources on the ciphers and two on the flashlight
<i>What about his threats on children?</i>  Suspect worked for elementary schools  <i>and was fired for molestation in March, April '68.</i>  <i> Could give him motive
At the very least, it's home turf.</i>  <i>He'd have knowledge of bus routes,</i>  which the two major threats centered around
<i>What about the bomb?</i>  Allen works as a chemist
Take him through the geography
Vallejo murders
Berryessa murder
<i>Does he have any alibis?</i>  <i>He claimed he did, but he's been unable to produce the names</i>  of the couple he supposedly met on the day of Berryessa
The bottom line is that Allen can't alibi up on anything
<i>Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.</i>  <i> You want to tell me about the name
What name?</i>  Zodiac
Allen wears a watch that bears both the word and crosshair symbol
<i> John...  That's pretty good, guys.</i>  <i> We think so, too
Let's take it to a judge.</i>  Mr. Allen
This is the Santa Rosa Police Department
We have a warrant to search your residence
Hello
Close the door
You think somebody tipped him
We're not leaving till he comes back
I'll check the back
Jesus
What
Squirrels
We'll have those checked for blood
And a pair of black gloves
<i>Dave, I got a gun
Check that
Two guns.</i>  <i>They're both
22s
For little darlings bouncing off buses
Someone's here
<i>Hello, Arthur
Remember us?</i>  No
<i>Ballistics, no match
Prints, no match
Writing, no match.</i>  <i>On both hands, right?</i>  Because we got handwriting from both his hands
And neither hand matches
Forget Sherwood
Let's get another opinion
Hey
What do you want
A hug
Do you know what the worst part of this is
I can't tell if I wanted it to be Allen so bad  <i>because I actually thought it was him, or I just want all this to be over.</i>  It's because you thought it was him
<i>And I did, too.</i>  You know what
Take some time off
Go to Candlestick
See a movie
<i>"To the city of San Francisco, I will enjoy killing one person every day</i>  <i>"until you pay me $100,000.</i>  <i>"If you agree, say so tomorrow morning</i>  <i>"in the personal column San Francisco Chronicle,</i>  <i>"and I will set up meeting.</i>  <i>"If I do not hear from you,</i>  <i>"it will be my next pleasure to kill a Catholic priest or a...</i>  <i>"...

Cheers
To your health and mine
Mostly mine
<i>So,</i>  what's new
Yeah
Somebody should write a book
<i>Somebody should write a fucking book, that's for sure.</i>   About what
It's not new
<i>I've been thinking that if you put all the information together,</i>  maybe you could jog something loose
Yeah
That's true
<i>You know all the players, and you have all the files.</i>  Lost them
You lost them
I don't know
I moved onto a boat
<i>You know that we work in the daily business, right?</i>  <i>As in, today.</i>  What do you think we were doing back then
Do you know that more people die in the East Bay commute  every three months than that idiot ever killed
<i>He offed a few citizens,</i>  <i>he wrote a few letters, and he faded into a footnote.</i>  Not that I haven't been sitting here idly  waiting for you to drop by and reinvigorate my sense of purpose
Let it fucking go
You're wrong
It was important
<i>Oh, that's right, I forgot
You went to the library.</i>  I'm sorry I bothered you
<i> Hey, hi
Hi.</i>   Where you been
Thank you
<i> Inspector Toschi
Yeah
Hi
We met at the movies once
It must have been magical
<i>I'm Robert Graysmith
I work at the Chronicle.</i>  I was wondering if I could buy you lunch
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch
I wanted to ask you about Zodiac
<i>Well, I appreciate the interest, but we don't discuss open cases.</i>  <i>Oh, well, what's going on with it, day to day?</i>  We're actively pursuing all leads
<i>And you're the only one on it, right?</i>  <i>Mr
Graysmith,</i>  Zodiac hasn't written in three years
You know how many murders we've had in San Francisco since then
No
That's a lot of dead people and grieving families that need our help
I care
Okay
Can I show you something
I've been doing research on the first cipher
Everything an amateur would need to create it  can be found in these books
<i>So, I remember you thought that Zodiac was military,</i>  so I went to every base library and I got a list of every person  who's ever checked out these books and that's when I found this
Missing
It means they were stolen
Somebody didn't want a record of ever having checked out these books
Who are you again
I just wanna help
I can't discuss the case with you
<i>I can't give you information, and I certainly couldn't tell you</i>  to go see Ken Narlow in Napa
N ARLOW
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith, but we don't cooperate with writers.</i>  <i>Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.</i>   And Dave Toschi sent you
Why
Maybe he...  Maybe he thought that I could do some good
<i> What are you, some kind of boy scout
Eagle Scout, actually, first class.</i>  <i>Well, if you wanna do this, don't let me stop you.</i>  <i>Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.</i>  I understand what you're trying to do
But this is an open police investigation
I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's
And he said that you might be able to help
<i>I mean, the case is dead
<i>So, what's the harm?</i>  <i>No pens, no paper.</i>  <i>Anything that you see that's relevant, you got to remember in your head.</i>  Okay
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>   Which one
All of them
And there's more in the next room
<i>You don't smoke, do you?</i>  Once
In high school
What's this
Thank you
<i>Man, you really creeped us out.</i>  <i>"Nine millimeter.</i>  <i>"Said nothing and began firing
"</i>  "Most Dangerous Game
<i>"Do not eliminate this suspect because of handwriting.</i>  <i>"Not because of handwriting.</i>  <i>"Darlene's sister, Linda.</i>  "It was all just deep breathing
George
George
Strange man. 
<i>Oh, briefcase
Oh, thanks.</i>  <i> Hey, Jack
Hey, Bawart.</i>   Who's that
Some cartoonist
Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac
<i>Well, good for him.</i>  <i> Thank you for meeting me, Inspector
No
We're not meeting, Robert.</i>  We're just two guys who happen to be sitting  on the same bench at the same time
I've got five minutes
I've got to get back to the Hall
As far as you know, did anyone ever get in touch</i>  with Mike Mageau during your investigation   and show him suspect photos
Why
You've got four minutes now
Darlene Ferrin was being followed
<i>Now, I know Mulanax says that they already found this guy,</i>  a George Waters
But he also said that she had a lot of admirers  who would come to the restaurant where she worked
She was popular
Yeah
So...  <i>She and her husband, they move into their new house,</i>  and one night they throw this painting party
And what's a painting party
Sounds like a terrible party
<i>Well, supposedly, somebody who's not Waters shows up.</i>  And Darlene is terrified of him
So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac
<i>And if Zodiac knew Darlene, then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.</i>  Maybe
But Mageau's gone
<i>So if you wanna connect Darlene to Zodiac,</i>  you're gonna have to find another way
Phone calls the night of Darlene's murder
<i> Yeah, Zodiac called the police
No, Dave, there were four other calls.</i>  <i>There were two to Darlene's house, one to Darlene's brotherinlaw,</i>  and one to Darlene's fatherinlaw
Just heavy breathing
Yeah
God damn it
<i>It's got to be more than just a coincidence, right?</i>  <i>I mean, somebody doesn't just randomly prank phone call a victim's entire family</i>  90 minutes after they were shot
<i>So, either Zodiac shoots a random couple,</i>  then he recognizes Darlene...  Or Darlene was shot on purpose
<i>Either way, Zodiac had to have known Darlene.</i>  <i>That's good, Robert.</i>  <i>So, I can't find Mageau, so maybe I can find Darlene's sister.</i>  And maybe she can tell me who this mystery man is
Try that
I've got to go
<i>You know,</i>  it's interesting that you should mention Zodiac calling people at home
He did that in San Francisco once
What
I can't tell you
That's privileged information
But maybe Melvin Belli could
Melvin Belli
<i> He should be along soon
Oh, that's all right.</i>  <i>I've really..
<i>Oh, cookies
Thank you
These look great.</i>   You are here on business
I'm writing a book about the Zodiac
I remember that
I spoke to him
No, to the Zodiac when he called.</i>  He said he had to kill because it was his birthday
He said it..
Wait
He said it was his birthday
Yes
You want something to drink
Oh, so many years ago.</i>  Mr. Belli was away for Christmas
Gone for a week
<i>The Zodiac called, wanting to talk to him.</i>  <i>I said, "He is not here
Today is my birthday
Then the letter arrived
<i>So, the call came before the letter of December 20th.</i>  Mr. Belli was gone for a week
He came back on Christmas
Not a good day to work
<i>So, he left on the 18th.</i>  Is that helpful
She said it was his birthday
<i>Well, you'd have to confirm that, now wouldn't you?</i>  How
<i>Well, I never spoke to her, but maybe my partner did.</i>  <i> How do I get a hold of him
Bill wanted out of this.</i>  <i>As far as I'm concerned, he should stay out.</i>  How do I confirm it
Mel Nicolai.</i>  <i> Thank you
Goodbye.</i>  I just need to confirm a date
Mr. Graysmith..
I've narrowed it down  <i>between the 18th and the 20th of December, and I just need...</i>  <i>Okay, I'll play
Let's say this phone call did take place.</i>  Let's say it really was Zodiac
Why would he volunteer the day he was born
<i>He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith.</i>  What if he made a mistake
What if he wasn't lying
What if it was him on the phone
<i>He didn't expect to pick it up, a nice person to pick up.</i>  What if
What if
None of the suspects had the same birthday as this phantom caller
Bill Armstrong
Can I give you a piece of advice
You're looking in the wrong place
<i>Handwriting, fingerprints, that's what this whole thing's about.</i>  Stick to the evidence
Hi
Hey
Long
Who's Sherwood Morrill
He's a handwriting expert in Sacramento
He called
<i>Oh, great.</i>   So you're taking off work
Just an hour
Sacramento's two hours away
Really
Yes
<i>Oh, that's that article.</i>  "Robert Graysmith has quietly been shopping his book about the Zodiac. 
Yeah
It talks all about you researching Zodiac
<i>Well, that's what the article's about.</i>  I'm not so sure that's something we want people to know about
Are you embarrassed
<i>Robert, what's the one thing we know about Zodiac?</i>  <i>He reads the Chronicle.</i>  <i>Yeah, but he's never gonna read Herb Caen.</i>  <i> Hello
I can tell you who the Zodiac is.</i>  Who is this
<i>The Zodiac Killer is obsessed with movies.</i>  <i>He recorded his murders on film.</i>  <i>I tried to tell the police, but they wouldn't follow through on it.</i>  <i>There's a man you need to find
His name is Bob Vaughn.</i>  <i> Pen, pen
V AUGHN.</i>  <i>He's a friend of the Zodiac's.</i>  <i>Mr
Who is this friend?</i>  <i>You have quite enough to get started.</i>  <i>Oh, please.</i>  <i>The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.</i>  Your toast is burning
We choose at some point in our lives how to physically construct each letter
<i>Once we lock that into our brains,</i>  <i>our handwriting may change over the years,</i>  but the moves themselves remain unaltered
Understand
Yes
Except Zodiac's doesn't
We don't know
<i>Excuse me, I've got to spray this.</i>  How many suspects were cleared through handwriting
All of them
Also the print in the cab
No match was ever found
Is there any way that someone could beat a handwriting test
No
He said he knew who the Zodiac was
Gave me a name
Rick
Rick Marshall
Yeah
<i>I think that the man who you talked to called me, too.</i>  <i>After he left, then I checked my files.</i>  I never cleared a Rick Marshall
Hello
Who is this
It's a wrong number
Does the name Rick Marshall mean anything to you
What are you after
<i>Hypothetically, you just named my favorite suspect in the whole case.</i>  This is off the record
<i>Couple years back, I was trying to get Marshall's prints.</i>  I handed him a photo
<i>He looks at it
He's about to give it back and he stops and he says,</i>  <i>"My goodness, I got fingerprints all over this
Why didn't you test him for handwriting
<i>Because when they finally did run his prints,</i>  they cleared him against the one in Stine's cab
<i> So, then, it's not him
Maybe yes, maybe no.</i>  No
What do you mean
<i>If he had the foresight to bring gloves with him,</i>  how the hell's he gonna accidentally leave a print behind
But it was in the victim's blood
<i>Could have been one of the bystanders,</i>  <i>or a cop just reaches out, boom, false print.</i>  <i>Yeah, but that print disqualified 2,500 suspects.</i>  Which is why we also used handwriting
But not for Rick Marshall
<i>Decided it looked nothing like the Z letters, so they just moved on.</i>  How do they know that Rick Marshall wrote the sign
My thoughts exactly
He received code training
He was also a projectionist at a silent film theater
<i>Well, then, how do I get copies of Rick Marshall's handwriting?</i>  <i>Three ways
One, get a warrant, which you can't.</i>  <i>Two, get him to volunteer, which he won't.</i>  <i>Yeah, and three?</i>  Get creative
<i>I don't know what to tell you
You get it, I'll analyze it.</i>  <i>Beyond that, you're on your own.</i>  <i>Okay, what about the guy who came to see you,</i>  the one who called me
<i>You mean Wallace Penny?</i>  Yeah
Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.</i>  <i>How did you find me?</i>  I need a sample of Rick Marshall's handwriting
<i>I told you
Vaughn is who...</i>  <i>Mr
Penny, if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac,</i>  I need a sample of his handwriting to confirm it
Can you help me or not
<i>Rick used to draw movie posters for the theater Vaughn worked at.</i>  <i> I'll send one down
Yeah, but is it...</i>  It's as close as I've ever seen
We have to tread lightly here
We're talking about implicating this man as the Zodiac
I can get more
<i>I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister.</i>  <i>I've been to the DMV, and I talked to her parents,</i>  <i>but still, nobody knows where to find her.</i>  <i>Mr
Graysmith, most of the writing matches the exemplar.</i>  <i>In a way, though, it's the part that doesn't match that scares me the most.</i>  <i> What do you mean
Toschi needs to call in on a landline.</i>  <i> Dispatch
Hey
Dave Toschi.</i>  <i>I'll connect you.</i>  <i> Dave
Yeah
What's up?</i>  <i>Jennings here from the Chronicle.</i>  It came in this morning and you need to see it right now
See what
<i>The new Zodiac letter
All right, come on.</i>  Hall of Justice
<i>Now
Do you have it with you
"This is the Zodiac speaking
I'm back with you
Who will play me
"I'm now in control of all things. 
These guys are from Internal Affairs
We need to talk
<i>Good evening
Our top story tonight,</i>  <i>Good evening
Our top story tonight,</i>  <i>the San Francisco Police Department has confirmed</i>  <i>that the man who calls himself the Zodiac</i>  <i>and terrorized the Bay Area has broken his silence of 51 months.</i>  <i>In a letter claiming, "I am back with you,"</i>  <i>the Zodiac makes no overt threats against the citizenry,</i>  <i>and muses that his life and times would make the best movie script yet.</i>  These carrots are perfect
<i>The terse 66 word message also manages...</i>  Just go
Are they targets?</i>  <i>Fine, but you have to come back</i>  and finish at least half of what's on that plate
<i>More team coverage on the cipher slayer's return...</i>   Okay
Okay
David got a kick out of it  and so he wrote a couple of anonymous letters  asking for the character to be brought back
<i>It was like writing fan mail to himself
And I'm sure that this will all blow over.</i>  <i>Blow over?</i>  They kicked him out of Homicide
They made him give his handwriting like some common criminal
<i> May I talk to him
No.</i>  <i>Okay, can you just ask him</i>  if he ever investigated a man named Rick Marshall
Is that all you can think about
<i>Mr
We trust...</i>  <i>This girl, she wants music lessons?</i>  Dave
Dave
You stop calling my house
Do you understand me
I just need your help to find Linda
<i> Jesus
Look, two seconds.</i>  <i>Look, we've been running handwriting samples.</i>   Who's we
Sherwood and I.  Sherwood
Sherwood who drinks like Paul Avery now
He retired
Is that what he told you
<i> What, are you saying he's wrong
No, Robert.</i>  <i>No, I know you don't think it's him.</i>  <i>I mean, no, I am not having this conversation.</i>  <i>But I think that Marshall knew Darlene, and I can't talk to Mageau or Linda,</i>  so I'm gonna talk to Bob Vaughn
<i> Robert
What?</i>  <i>Okay, the Rick Marshalls of this world will suck you dry.</i>  They're blind alleys
<i>But he said he wasn't gonna announce his murders anymore, Dave.</i>  He was just gonna do them
Do you know what the chances of us arresting someone are now
Too much of the evidence is lost.</i>  <i>People get old, Robert
They forget.</i>  <i>Now, I have been a cop for 25 years
Murder police for 12.</i>   What do you do for a living
You know what I do for a living
So what are you saying
I am saying Zodiac was my job
It is not yours
<i> He's still out there, Dave
No, Robert
I am through with this.</i>  I am through with you
<i>What about September 26, 1970?</i>  <i> Okay, which one was that
Dad
Mark that
<i>Got another one
June 19th, 1971.</i>  That's got to be near the summer solstice
<i>Oh, guys.</i>  <i>Don't tell Mom about our special project, okay?</i>  How come you and Mom don't sleep in the same bed anymore
Hello
<i>Mr
Thank you for calling me back.</i>  <i>Yeah
How can I help?</i>  I called you because we've been crossreferencing lunar cycles  with the Zodiac's timeline
<i>More often than not, each cycle since '69 corresponds with an attack</i>  <i>or with one of the letters, or an unsolved homicide.</i>  <i> Who's working with you on this
Some colleagues.</i>  Dad
<i> Ken, can you hold on one second
Dad?</i>   What is it
<i>In the decade since the Zodiac's last cipher was received,</i>  <i>every federal agency has taken a crack at decoding it.</i>  <i>But today, where those agencies had failed,</i>  <i>a cartoonist has succeeded.</i>  <i>How did you do it?</i>  <i>Oh, just a lot of books from the library, and I love puzzles, so I just...</i>  Yeah
The fucking library
<i>I believe that you can accomplish anything that you put your mind...</i>  That's a "J"
Okay
Thank you so much
She's in jail
Isn't that great?</i>  Why'd you do it
Because she'll be able to identify Rick...   What are you talking about
You went on TV
You put yourself out there for him to see
<i>Oh, hon, you're being paranoid.</i>  Then who's been calling our house in the middle of the night  at least once a week
Nobody
I have to go see Bob Vaughn
<i>Well, that's too bad, because we're gonna talk about this.</i>  And when is it gonna be finished
When you catch him
When you arrest him
Be serious
I am serious
I need to know who he is
Is that more important than your family's safety
Why
Why do you need to do this
Why
Because nobody else will
Are you done
Can I go
Mr. Vaughn
Mr. Graysmith
Hi
You needed to speak to me
Yes
There's a coffee shop right on the corner
<i> Why don't we just go to my home
Oh, I don't wanna put you out.</i>  It's no trouble at all
Where are you parked
Just right there
Oh
Okay
Watch your step
Come in
Oh, thank you.</i>  It's very rustic
<i> Can I take your jacket
This way, please.</i>   Have a seat
Thank you
Oh, no, I'm all right.</i>   You sure
Yes
I wanted to ask you about a film that the Avenue may have played  while you were the organist there
<i>The Most Dangerous Game?</i>  <i>Oh, it's a classic
RKO
We've run that picture many times.</i>  <i>In '68, '69?</i>  I'd have to check my records
Why
Do you remember the Zodiac
<i>This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?</i>  <i> He was a projectionist there, right
<i>Okay
Well, there is a connection</i>  between one of the Zodiac attacks and that film
You mean the symbol
The Zodiac symbol on film
It's on the countdown
<i>It's trimmed off each reel before it's shown,</i>  but it always arrives with it
Right there
<i>The first time I saw it in the papers, I thought about that.</i>  We got a tip  that Rick left a film canister here that he told you never to open
Is it true
Yes
Did you open it
No
Rick took it back in 1972
This tip is how you got it in your head that Rick is the Zodiac
That and the poster
The poster that Rick drew
The handwriting is the closest that we have ever come to a match
<i> Rick didn't draw any posters
No, he drew this one.</i>  <i>Mr
Graysmith, I do the posters myself.</i>  That's my handwriting
Why don't I just go and find out when we played that film
<i>Oh, that's all right.</i>  It's not a problem
They're just down in the basement
Not many people have basements in California
<i>You coming, Mr. Graysmith?</i>  <i>The original studio onesheets, I always kept for myself.</i>  The cheapo knockoffs like you brought today  I end up tossing into the back alley
'69
You live alone
<i>Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.</i>  <i>So, that would be about</i>  <i>nine weeks before the first Zodiac letter, correct?</i>  Yeah
Do you think he saw the film in our theater and was inspired
Are you sure there's nobody else in the house
Would you like to go upstairs and check
Thanks for everything
You're welcome
It's locked
Thank you
Got to be two killers
One has the...  Guys
You've got five minutes
Linda
<i>Hi, I'm Robert.</i>  Did you get my note
What's this about
Zodiac
You got the look
What look
I didn't mean anything
Tell me about this painting party
<i>Darlene always had a lot of boys around,</i>  even though she was married
<i>And this one guy was weird, though.</i>  He used to bring her presents from Tijuana and..
She once told me he'd killed somebody
Really
<i>Yeah, I think maybe when he was in the service.</i>   Navy
Was he into movies
Was he a movie buff
I can tell you that he was not into people
<i>The party Darlene threw,</i>  <i>people were supposed to just show up and drink beer, help paint.</i>  <i>But this guy showed up in a suit,</i>  and just sat in a chair all by himself all night long
Didn't talk to anyone
She was scared of him
<i>And a couple of weeks later, she was dead.</i>  I'm sorry
Do you remember his name
<i>I mean, it was short, like a nickname, like Stan.</i>  <i> Rick
Yeah
How can you be sure
It was a long time ago
Think hard
It was Rick
<i>No, it wasn't.</i>   It was Rick
It was Rick Marshall
No
It wasn't Rick
It was Leigh
<i> Leigh
Yeah, Leigh.</i>  <i> Leigh
Yeah, Leigh.</i>  Sounds right
Officer
I need you to let me in
8:00 a. M., when we're open.</i>  Sergeant
Sergeant Mulanax
<i>Sergeant, I just need to see one file!</i>  Just give me five minutes
I know exactly where it is
Please
I shouldn't be talking to you
Okay
Here
Here
So what
He knew her
Linda said Leigh
This is Leigh
No
It's nothing
Dave Toschi...  Agrees with me
Our investigation into this subject is over
I'm sorry
Hello
Who's there
Oh, I've been kind of busy.</i>  Yeah
I can see that
I tried to send you these
<i>I called the Chron.</i>  <i>Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore, so...</i>  I heard
When's the last time you ate something
Nothing makes sense anymore
<i> Did it ever
Yeah, it did.</i>  <i>Robert, it was just the date that didn't end.</i>  You don't mean that
The kids miss you
Neither can I
<i>So, do whatever you have to,</i>  but finish this
Dave
It's Robert
Dave
Is he actually here
I'm gonna kill him
I'm calling SFPD
Where's my gun
Dave
Robert
He made a mistake
Get away from the window
I'll meet you around front
<i>No, you won't.</i>  <i> You have to hear this
No, I don't, Robert!</i>  The birthday was the one time that he was weak
The one time that he gave something away
<i> Robert, I am calling the police
He called the Bellis' house
December '69
Today's my birthday. 
It was his birthday
Arthur Leigh Allen was born on December 18th
Get in here
Here you go
Thanks
<i>He wrote me, you know?</i>  <i>2,500 suspects,</i>  the only one who ever wrote me a letter was Leigh Allen
He sent me that when he got out
And it's typewritten
Using a typewriter is not a crime
And he knew Darlene
It's in the Vallejo files
Mulanax said that he was your favorite suspect
Sherwood disqualified his handwriting
The same Sherwood that drinks like Paul Avery now
<i>Yes, you have Sherwood Morrill in writing saying,</i>  <i>"I'm sorry, this just won't work
"</i>   But you also have Terry Pascoe...  His protégé
"Do not disqualify this suspect on the basis of handwriting. 
<i> So the two cancel each other out
No, they don't.</i>  It was Sherwood's case
He was the head of Questioned Documents
<i>If it went to trial,</i>  all the defense would have to do is call Sherwood to the stand
<i>And there was no way of getting Allen into court in the first place,</i>  <i>because there was no evidence, Robert.</i>  <i>What do you mean, there's no evidence?</i>  You have him seen with the ciphers
The same size shoes and gloves
<i>The Most Dangerous Game
The Zodiac watch.</i>  The background with school children
The misspellings of Christmass
All circumstantial
<i>Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.</i>  We should have found one of those things in that trailer
We didn't
That's..
Catherine Allen states that  "Leigh cleaned out his trailer on Friday after work  <i>"and moved it to Santa Rosa on Saturday, August 7th, 1971
"</i>  You interviewed him at the refinery on August 4th
So, he's cleaning out his trailer,</i>  he's moving into a different county 48 hours after you interviewed him
<i>Okay
Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.</i>  All right
<i>Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen and the Zodiac, their timelines.</i>  <i> When was the first murder in Vallejo
Christmas, 1968.</i>  <i>Eight months before that, Allen is fired for molesting his students</i>  and his family discovers that he's a pedophile
<i> Now, when do the letters begin
And they continue until you go to see him at work
<i>Now, after that, do any of the letters contain swatches of Paul Stine's shirt?</i>  <i>No
Because he dumped them, because he got scared.</i>  Because he knew that you were on to him
<i> So, when's the next letter from Zodiac
<i>Then, in '74, he feels comfortable again</i>  because everybody's moved off Allen as a suspect
And what do we get
<i>Three new letters from Zodiac in January, May, and July in '74.</i>   But then the letters stop
What happens to Allen
He's arrested
<i> When is he released
August, '77.</i>  <i>Allen gets out
He types you an apology, and then what?</i>  We get our first new Zodiac letter in four years
<i>Okay
Yes
<i>So, all coincidence aside, Robert,</i>  how can you be sure that Leigh Allen is the Leigh from this file
<i>Now, Vallejo is a small town, but it's not that small.</i>  How do you put the two of them together
<i>This is a case that's covered both Northern and Southern California,</i>  with victims and suspects spread over hundreds of miles
Would you agree
Yes
Darlene Ferrin worked at the Vallejo House of Pancakes  on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll
<i>Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.</i>  Is that true
I've walked it
So
<i>The prints, the handwriting...</i>   I'm not asking you as a cop
I can't prove this
<i>Just because you can't prove it, doesn't mean it's not true.</i>  <i>Easy, Dirty Harry.</i>  Finish the book
Thank you
Thank you for breakfast
Can I help you
No
Thanks for coming to see me
You're the one I talked to on the phone
I'm George Bawart
Vallejo PD
I took over for Jack Mulanax
It's been 22 years
<i>Well, this is just a formality.</i>  I'm gonna show you a group of photographs
<i>Now, the person that shot you may or may not be</i>  among these photographs
You don't have to pick anybody out  <i>just because I'm showing you these pictures, you understand?</i>  <i>Yes, sir, I do.</i>  All right
<i>If you don't recognize anyone, that's okay.</i>  That's him
How sure are you
<i>Yeah, I'm pretty sure.</i>  He had a round face like this guy
Wait
<i>No, no
Just that he had a round face like that.</i>  It's this man
All right
<i>Now, on a scale of one to 10, 10 being positive,</i>  how sure are you
At least an eight
