Get in there
Oh

Hell of a way to make a landing

Maybe four
Hey, Frank
Can we hurry this up
All right, all right
Let's get it going

Right
Here we go, Mr. Dillon

[ All ] Amen
This is rumor control
Here are the facts
As some of you know,  a 337 model E.E.V....  crashlanded here at 0600...  on the morning watch
There was one survivor,  two dead and a droid that was hopelessly smashed beyond repair
The survivor is a woman
I just want to say that I've taken a vow of celibacy
That also includes women
Yes
I'd like to say that I, for one,  do not appreciate company policy allowing her to freely...  intermingle with inmates and the rest of the staff
We are well aware of your feelings in this matter
You will be pleased to know that I have requested a rescue team
Hopefully, they will be here inside of a week  Oh, come on
And evacuate her A.S.A.P
She doesn't seem too badly damaged
She's unconscious
Can't give you a more specific diagnosis at the moment
Will she live
I would think so
It's in everybody's interest...  the woman doesn't come out of the infirmary until the rescue team arrives
And certainly not without an escort, right
Sir
Gentlemen, we should all stick to our set routine...  and not get unduly agitated
Right
All right
Thank you, gentlemen
All right
there ain't gonna be much left
It's just a little cocktail of my own mix
Sort of eyeopener
You a doctor
My name is Clemens
Here
Fury 161
It's one of WeylandYutani's backwater work prisons,  it grieves me to say
Do you mind
This is basically a stabilizer
We have a big problem with lice here
And when you're feeling better, I'll give you some clippers,  and you can tend to your private parts yourself
How'd I get here
Evidently separated from your mother ship before you hit our atmosphere
You have any idea how long you were in hypersleep
'Cause coming out the way you did can be quite a jolt to the system
Indeed
Where are the others
What
They didn't survive
I have to get to the ship
Have to get to the ship
You're in no condition for that
You want to get me some clothes, or should I just go like this
Given the nature of our indigenous population, I would suggest clothes
[ Clears Throat ]  None of them have seen a woman in years
This used to be a 5,000 convict facility,  but it's been reduced to a custodial staff of 25
Keep the pilot light on
The pilot light for what
Blast furnace
We have a foundry, Lieutenant Ripley
The inmates forge lead sheets for toxic waste containers
How do you know my name
It's stenciled on the back of your shorts
Where are the bodies
We have a morgue
We put them there until the investigative team arrives in about a week, I think
There was a droid
There were bits and pieces of him all over the place
We put what was left on the rubbish tip
He never knew what hit him
And the girl
I don't think she was conscious when it happened
Um, I'm sorry
Where is she
In the morgue
I have to see her
I have to see what's left of her
Is there any particular reason that you're so insistent
I have to be sure how she died
I hate to be repetitious about such a sensitive subject,  but it is persectly clear that she drowned
Was she your daughter
She wasn't
Um  CCould I have a moment alone, please
Yes, of course
What's she doing
Okay
No
What
I told you,  we have to make sure how she died
And I told you, she drowned
II have to see inside of her
You're disorientated
Half your system's still in  I have a very, very good reason
Well, perhaps you'd like to share that reason
What kind exactly
Cholera
There hasn't been a case of cholera reported for 200 years
Please
Everything's in place
There's no sign of infection
No indication of disease
Chest
Open the chest
Lungs
Flooded with fluid
Ergo, she drowned
Mr. Clemens
Superintendent
I don't believe you've met Lieutenant Ripley
That's right, sir
What's going on, Mr. Clemens
Second, in the interest of public health,  I am performing an autopsy
Without my authority
Well, there didn't seem to be time
But it's turned out all right
There's no sign of contagion in the body
But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley didn't parade around in front of the prisoners,  as I am told she did in the last hour
It might also be helpful...  if you kept me informed as to any change in her physical status
Or would that be asking too much
Nonsense
We'll keep the bodies on ice till the rescue team arrives
On ice
There is the public health issue
I thought you said there was no sign of disease
It would appear that the child drowned
But without the benefit of proper laboratory tests,  it's impossible to be absolutely certain
I would consider it unwise...  to tolerate even the possibility of an unwelcome virus
An outbreak of cholera would look extremely bad on a report
Would it not, sir
We've 25 prisoners in this facility
All thieves, rapists, murderers, child molesters
All scum
Just because they've taken on religion doesn't make them any less dangerous
I try not to offend their convictions
I don't want to upset the order
And I don't want a woman walking around giving them ideas
I see
For my own personal safety
I will leave the details of the cremation to you, Mr. Clemens
They may use the furnace, but I want everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours
You called it, sir
Ah, Christmas has come early, Murph
Any dead ox is a good ox
You're bloody right
Smelly bastards, all covered in lice
God, I hates hosin' these bastards down
I always get shite all over me boots
Talkin' of hosing things down, FrankYeah
You had the chance, what would you say to her
What do you mean, if I got the chance
You know
You mean, casual like
Yeah
I mean, how would you put it to her if you bumped into her in the mess hall or somewhere
I've never had any problem with the ladies
I'd say to her, "Good day, my dear
Anything I can do to be of service?
Then I'd give her the look, you knowup and down
[ Grunts ]  And I'd give her the wink, the dirty smile
Yeah, right
And then she'd say, "Kiss my ass, you horny old fucker!
I'd be happy to kiss her ass
I'd be happy to kiss her anywhere she wants
Yeah, but treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen
Right, Frank
Told you before, Murph
Treat a queen like a whore and a whore like a queen
What do you think killed Babe
Beats me
She just keeled over
How old was she
In her prime
Never mind
We'll chop her up later and throw her in the stew
Hey, Frank
What's this
"Their bodies...  "have been taken from the shadow of our nights
"They have been released...  from all darkness and pain.
"The child and the man...  "have gone beyond our world
"They are forever eternal...  "and everlasting
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Why are the innocent punished
Why the pain
There aren't any promises
Only that some get called, some get saved
She won't ever know the hardship and grief...  for those of us left behind
We commit these bodies to the void...  with a glad heart
For within each seed,  there is a promise of a flower
[ Gurgling ]  And within each death,  no matter how small,  there's always a new life
Amen
I'll tell you, it's fucking weird
The only one to survive that crash is a woman
What trouble can she cause
She's already changed everything
Okay
Any you guys want to tell me what the problem is
Come on
Speak to me, brothers
All right
I don't mind the dark
I don't mind the bugs
I don't mind wanderin' around in some cold, wet, damp tunnel for a week at a time
I don't mind anything
But I mind Golic
That the way you feel about it
Yeah
The guy's crazy and he smells bad
Well, he's going with you
Golic is just another poor, miserable, suffering son of a bitch, just like you and me
'Cept he smells worse
And he's crazy

Well, we've never had any before,  but we tolerate anybody

Fraternizing with a prisoner

On Intercom ] Mr. Clemens
Mr. Aaron
Superintendent Andrews would like you to report...  to vent shaft 22 on the second quadrantnow
We've had an accident
You could call it that
One of our prisoners has been... diced
Sorry
I have to go
Who was it
Murphy
How do you know
I gave him the assignment, sir
He was a wanker
It wasn't your fault
Well, not much to say, is there
Death was instantaneous
No shit
Sudden rush of air, I'd imagine, except  Right
Almost happened to me once
I've told him so many times, "Stay away from the fans.
Nobody bloody listens
What's that
I don't know
I want to see you in my quarters in 30 minutes, if you'll please, Mr. Clemens
Have you got any ideas
Here you are
You know, wandering around without an escort...  is really gonna piss Superintendent Andrews off
One of the prisoners has been killed
Really
How
Hmm
In the air shaft
I found something at the accident site,  just a bit away from where it happened
A mark
Rather like the one you found on the girl's cryotube
Look
I'm on your side
Lf you really wanna help,  find me a computer with audio capabilities...  so I can access this flight recorder
We don't have anything like that here
Bishop
The droid that crashed with me
I can point you in the right direction
I can't join you
I have a previous engagement
Golic, don't fidget
What's all this shit
What the hell does he ever do right
Eat
He's got that down pretty good
You light a candle for Murphy
I'll light a thousand
Never complained about me once
Is it true what they say
His head split into a million pieces
Sit down, Mr. Clemens
Thank you
Sugar
Uh, no thanks
Milk
Just a little, please
Listen to me, you piece of shit
You screw with me one more time, I'll cut you in half
I don't think I understand
At 0700 hours, I received word from the network
They want this woman looked after
They consider her to be very high priority
Why
L have no idea
But why did you let her out of the infirmary
This accident with Murphy is what happens...  when one of these dumb sons of a bitches walks around with a hardon
You're the jailer
We both know exactly what you are
I think it might be better if I left
I find you... unpleasant to be around
You do
Isn't that lovely
Consider this, Mr. Clemens
How would you like me to explain your sordid history...  to your newfound friend
Now sit the hell down
I don't like you
You're unpredictable
Insolent
You question everything
If I didn't need a medical officer,  I wouldn't let you within light years of this operation
I'm eternally grateful
Keep your sarcasms to yourself
Now, is there anything I should know
About the woman
Don't play with me, Mr. Clemens
You spend every second you can with her
Has she said anything to youanything about where she's from, what her mission is
What the hell she was doing in an E.E.V.
Beyond that, I assume it's all classified
I haven't pressed her for more
That's all
That's all
Yes
Nothing more
No

What happened on the Sulaco
Stasis interrupted
Fire in cryogenic compartment
Repeat
Fire in cryogenic What happened
What started the fire, Bishop
Can you hear me
The fire was electrical
Did the sensors pick up anything moving around on the ship prior to separation
It's very dark here, Ripley
I'm not what I used to be
Just tell me
Yes
Is it on the Sulaco or did it come with us on the E.E.V.
It was with us all the way
Does the company know
The company knows everything that happened on the ship
It all goes into the computer and gets sent back to network
And they want it
Do me a favor
Disconnect me
I could be reworked, but I'll never be top of the line again
I'd rather be nothing
Do it for me, Ripley
It wasn't me
I didn't do it
Feeds on minds
It was  Nobody can stop it
What about Boggs and Rains
It wasn't me
It wasn't me
Stark raving mad
I'm not saying it was anyone's fault, but he should have been chained up
Mad as a fucking hatter
Keep him separated from the rest
I don't want him causing a panic
Clemens, sedate this poor idiot
Yeah
Now, now
Pull yourself together
Talk to me now
Now, where are Boggs and Rains
It wasn't me
It wasn't me
We'll have to send out a search team
I'm afraid we'll have to assume there's a very good chance...  this simple bastard has murdered them
Now, you don't know that
He's never lied to me
He's telling the truth
It was a dragon
[ Andrews ] You're not talking to anyone, Lieutenant
I'm not interested in your opinion,  because you are not in full possession of the facts
This man is a convicted multiple murderer, known for particularly brutal crimes
Yeah
That part's right
Then I'll talk to you
When I have finished with my official duties,  I will be quite pleased to have a little chat, yes
Let me see if I have this correct, Lieutenant
It's an eightfoot creature of some kind,  with acid for blood, and it arrived on your spaceship
It kills on sight and is generally unpleasant
And, of course, you expect me to accept all this on your word
No, I don't expect anything
Quite a story, Mr. Aaron
Right, sir
Never heard anything quite like it, sir
Expect not
Well, what kind of weapons have you got
This is a prison
It's not a good idea to allow prisoners access to firearms
What keeps them from killing you
There's no way to escape
With the arrival of the next supply ship, the company would eliminate them
This is a maximum security prison,  and you have no weapons of any kind
A few more in the mess hall
Some fire axes scattered about the place
Nothing terribly formidable
We're on the honor system
Then we're fucked
No, you're fucked
Confined to the infirmary
Quarantined
Mr. Aaron will escort you
I think you'll be safe from any large, nasty beast while you're there, right
all report to the mess hall
Mess hall, right away, people
Isn't there any way off of this place
Some way to escape
No
Supply ship comes every six months
And that's it
Fuck
They are sending somebody to pick you up quite soon, I gather
Really
[ Coughs ] What's "soon"
I don't know
Do you want to tell me what you and Andrews talked about
You'll just say I'm crazy
That's a bit uncharitable
[ Inhales, Coughing ]  How are you feeling
Sore throat
Sick to my stomach
Well, that's understandable given the circumstances
Perhaps I should give you one of my special cocktails
blames everybody for everything
There's no such thing as a perfect human
In an insane world,  a sane man...  must... appear... insane
That's very profound, Golic
Thank you
You married
Me
You should get married, have kids
I used to know lots of 'em back home
They used to like me
For a while
You're gonna die too
Are you
Just curious
No
How about leveling with me
Could you be more specific
When I asked how you got assigned here, you avoided the question
And then when I asked about the prison I.D
Lt's a long, sad story...  and more than a little melodramatic
Try me
If you insist
After my student years,  despite the fact that I had become...  secretly addicted to morphine,  I was considered to be most promising,  a man with a future
And during my first residency, I did a 36hour stretch on an E.R
Then I got called back
And 1 1 of them died
Not as a result of the accident...  but because I prescribed the wrong dosage of painkiller
I got seven years in prison and my license reduced to a 3C
At least I got off the morphine
L'm sorry
L think I was let off lightly
I got to know this motley crew quite well
So when they stayed, I stayed
Nobody else would employ me
Magnificent
Give us strength, O Lord, to endure
We recognize that we are poor sinners in the hands of an angry God
Let the circle be unbroken until the day
the fuck is happening here
What the fuck is this bullshit that's comin' down
We got murder
We got rape
We got brothers in trouble
I don't want no more bullshit around here
Now, we got problems, we stand together
Thank you, Mr. Dillon
Once again, this is rumor control
Here are the facts
At 0800 hours, prisoner Murphy,  through carelessness on his part,  was found dead in vent shaft 1 7
At about 21 00 hours,  prisoner Golic reappeared in a deranged state
Prisoners Boggs and Rains are missing
There seems to be a good chance that they have met with foul play...  at the hands of prisoner Golic
We need to organize and send out a search party
I think it's fair to say that our smoothly running facility...  has suddenly developed a few problems
I can only hope we are able to all pull together over the next few days...  until the rescue team arrives for Lieutenant Ripley
Lt's here
It got Clemens
Stop this raving at once
I'm telling you, it's here
Aaron, get that foolish woman back to the infirmary

He was a good man
I know you guys didn't appreciate him
Hey, sister, what about you
You're an officer
How about showing us a little leadership
You take charge
Right
No fuckin' way
I'm not the officer type
I just take care of my own
Well, what does this fucking beast want
Is this mother gonna try for us all
Yeah
Well, ain't that sweet
[ Clears Throat ]   We have no weapons
Is that correct
Right
I haven't seen one exactly like this before
But the others were afraid of fire  not much else
Can we seal off this area
No chance
There's 600 air ducts running to the surface
What about video
I see these closedcircuit monitors everywhere
We could try to find it that way
The video system hasn't worked in years
Nothing much works here
We ain't got no entertainment center, no climate control,  no video system, no surveillance,  no freezers, no fucking ice cream,  no rubbers, no women, no guns
All we got here is shit
Oh, what the hell are we even talking to her for
She's the one that brought the fucker
Why don't we just get her head and shove it through the fucking wall
That sounds good to me
Why don't you shut the fuck up

You don't look so good
What are we gonna do
Want a smack in the mouth, you stupid wanker
Shut the fuck up and stop causing panic
PanicYou're so fucking stupid, you couldn't spell it
We ought to panic
Whose fault is that
All right
Now shut up, both of you
Shut up
Oh, surprise me
What about outside
Great idea
Sun don't come up for another two days
It's 40 below zero
The rescue team's 1 0 hours away
So that makes a lot of sense
You just want us to stay here and let this thing have us for lunch
I want you to get everybody that's still left together
Get 'em into the assembly hall
Where'd she go
Need any help
You shouldn't be wandering around alone
Do me a favor and run this keyboard, will you
Okay
What do I do
"Display biofunctions.
That's it
Okay, we're hot
Now what
Let it run a cycle
Hit "enhancement.
Keep looking
Hemorrhaging will show as a dark patch
hairline fractures through the base of the skull
What is it
I think you've got one inside of you
That's not possible
What does it look like
I have to see it
Freeze it
You don't want to look at it
Freeze it
All right
The fucking thing is loose
It's out there
A rescue team is on its way with guns and shit
Right now there isn't any place that's real safe
This place never had any fucking air conditioning
If it comes in, it's gotta be through one of these doors
Now we post a guard to let us know if it's coming
In the meantime, you lay low, be ready and stay right...  in case your time comes
Don't you start bullshitting, Dillon
You got a weapon
You got a blade
Then you take it out and you fucking use it
Oh, right
No, I don't think shit
Maybe
Maybe you'll hurt it before it takes you out, huh
Isn't that something
And I'll tell you, until the rescue team gets here, we're fucked
So you better get prepared
Well, I ain't staying here
Fire
Furnace
Yeah
Holy shit
Well, all right
Fuckin' "A.
Fuckin' "A.
Too fuckin' right it's right
What do you want to say
Tell them the whole place has gone toxic
Are you kidding
Then they won't come here
The rescue team will turn back
Yeah
What are you talking about
Our only hope is that they kill this fucker
And maybe they can do something for you
I don't know, freeze you  They can do an operation
If this organism gets off the planet, it'll kill everything
The company doesn't care about that
They just want it for their bioweapons division, okay
So we can't let them come here
I don't give a shit about these stupid prisoners, but l've got a wife, a kid
I'll go home on the next rotation
I know
This is hard
I'm gonna send this message
I need that fucking code
It's classified
Listen, you stupid little shit
This has got to be done, okay
There are no alternatives
You're not getting it
No fucking way
Look, it's nothing personal
I think you're okay
Ah
Thanks
Have you got any ideas
[ Exhales ]  It won't kill me
I'm carrying the new queen
You really wanna bet this thing's that smart
Maybe I'll go find it
See how smart it is
You're gonna go and look for it
I have a pretty good idea of where it is
It's just down there... in the basement
This whole place is a basement
Wanna come
Where are you when I need you
Don't be afraid
L'm part of the family
You've been in my life so long,  I can't remember anything else
Now do something for me
Just  Just do what you do
Oh
What are you doing out here
You're supposed to be laying low
I have one inside of me
Big one won't kill its own
What are you talking about
I just saw it,  an hour ago
I could've been lunch, but it wouldn't touch me
It ran away
It knows I'm carrying its future
Aw, bullshit
It's a queenan egg layer
It can make thousands more like the one we've got here
Still sounds like bullshit to me
If that thing's inside you, how'd it get there
When I was in hypersleep, I guess
L was violated
Now I get to be the mother
I need you to help me
I need you to kill me
What the fuck are you talking about
I can't survive it
But the one inside of me can generate thousands more,  can wipe out the whole universe
Lt has to die
So somebody's gotta kill me
You don't have to worry about that
No speeches
No prayers
What's going on
I don't like losing a fight
Not to nobody, not to nothing
That damn thing out there has already killed half my men,  got the other half scared shitless
You said you were gonna kill me
You fucking coward
I want that thing
I want to get this thing, and I need you to do it
And if it won't kill you, then maybe that helps us fight it
Otherwise, fuck you
We waste this thing,  then you take care of me
No problem
Quick, easy and painless
You die sitting here on your ass, or you die out there
At least we take a shot
We owe it one
It's fucked us up
Maybe we can get even for the others
Now how do you want it
I'm talkin' about killing that big motherfucker
The rescue team's on its way
We could just sit this out
[ Ripley ] Rescue team for whom
For us
They just want the beast
You know that
I don't give a damn what they want
I wouldn't be so sure
They're gonna take us home
They're not gonna take us home
we should go out and fight it
Jesus Christ
Give us a break
Look, I've got a wife and a kid
Nobody gives a shit about you, 85
You're not one of us
You're not a believer
You're a fucking company man
Yeah, okay
You keep telling me how dumb I am
Well, I'm smart enough not to have a life sentence on this rock
Piss off, 85
Yeah, and I'm smart enough to wait for some firepower to show up before we fight this thing
Right, Morse
Okay
Just sit here on your asses
Fine
How about if I sit here on my ass
Oh, I forgot
You're the guy that's made a deal with God...  to live forever, huh
And all the rest of you pussies can sit it out too
Me and her'll do all the fighting
Okay
But I want the same thing as you
I want to see it dead
It killed my mates too
Why the fuck can't we wait for the company and have some guns on our side
Why do we have to go on some fucking suicide run
Right
They might kill you just for having seen it
But they're not gonna kill it
That is crazy
They will not kill us
When they first heard about this thing,  it was "crew expendable.
They were expendable too
What makes you think they're gonna care about a bunch of lifers...  who found God at the ass end of space
You really think they're going to let you...  interfere with their plans for this thing
They think we'rewe're crud
And they don't give a fuck about one friend of yours...  that'sthat's died
Have you got some sort of plan
This is a lead works, isn't it
All right
So how do we do that
Yeah
What are we gonna use for bait
Oh, fuck
We're all gonna die
The only question is when
This is as good a place as any...  to take your first steps to heaven
Do you want it on your feet...  or on your fucking knees, begging
Nobody ever gave me nothin'
So I say fuck that thing
Let's fight it
Let's go for it
Let's kick its fucking ass
What if it runs at us
That's a fucking good idea
Channel "A," Door 1 open
When was the last time you used this place
We fired it up five, six years ago
You sure the piston's gonna work
Then the piston's gonna push the mothersucker right into the mold
Then one of the guys will pour the lead
End of his ass
End of story
What if somebody screws it up
We're fucked
One shot at it
That's all
We'll never have time to reset it
Now remember, when you pull the lever,  for a few seconds you're gonna be trapped in here with that fuckin' thing
If you guys don't drop the ball, I won't
Because if it wants out, that's how it's gonna go
Through that alcove, through you
I'll be around
What about the others
Where are they
Praying
You believe in this heaven shit
Eh
I don't know
Fuck it, though
What else have we got to believe in
WellHey
What the fuck, right
I can't hear   Let's launch this thing
Channel "B," Door 7

Ow
[ Hissing ]  [ Screams ]   Morse
[ Screams ]  Gregor
All they have to do is run down the damn corridor
Stay here
Where the hell is it
Aw, Jesus

We have to trap it
[ Grunting ]  No

Is she still alive
If she's alive, she's in the furnace
She's in the lead works with the beast
Wouldn't wait
Jesus Christ
You fucker
Scared me shitless
You fuck
Come on, you bastard
Come on
Come on, get out of there
Come here
Ripley, we're running out of time
Ripley, where are you

Shut it
Shut it, Morse
Now
Shut the fucking door
[ Hisses ]  I'm going for the lead
Go
Now
What about you
Bullshit
There's gonna be 1 0 tons of hot lead in there
I keep telling you, I want to die
We got a deal
Remember
I'm not gonna move without you
Now get going
Dillon
I've got to hold it here
What about me
No
Pour the lead
[ Hisses ]  Go on
Pour it, Ripley
Go on
Pour that lead, Ripley
Pour it now
Come on
Come on
That's all you've got
Is that all that you fight, motherfucker
Morse
Morse, over here
Pour the lead
Pour the lead
[ Screaming ]  Pour it
[ Grunting ]  [ Grunting ]   I hate bugs
Ripley
It's burning hot
Hit the sprinklers
[ Hissing ]  [ Grunts ]   Gotcha
[ Ripley ] Don't come any closer
Wait
They're here to help
Stay where you are
Bishop
I'm here to help you
No more bullshit
I just felt it move
You know who I am
You're a droid
Same model as Bishop
No
I'm not the Bishop android
I designed it
The company sent me here to show you a friendly face,  to demonstrate how important you are to us,  to me
You just want to take it back
We want to kill it and take you home
Bullshit
We want to help
What does that mean
And keep it
Can't allow it to live
Everything we know would be in jeopardy
You don't want to take it back
Ripley, time is important
We've got a surgical bay set up on the rescue ship
Come with me
It's very quick
Painless
You'll be out for two hours
And then it's over
Let me help you
What guarantee do I have...  once you've taken it out, you'll destroy it
You have to trust me
Please
Trust me
No
[ Screams ]   Stop
Ow
Will you help me
What do you want me to do
It was a mistake
There was no need for any of it
Fucking android
Ripley, think of all we could learn from it
It's the chance of a lifetime
You must let me have it
It's a magnificent specimen
No pictures
You're crazy
What are you doing
No
Come on, you
Get going
Ash, Captain Dallas are dead
Cargo and ship destroyed
I should reach the frontier in about six weeks
With a little luck, the network will pick me up

<i>For a second, I forget about Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>  <i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>  It's getting exciting now
<i>That old thing, how you always hurt the one you love.</i>  <i>Well, it works both ways.</i>  <i>We have frontrow seats for this theater of mass destruction.</i>  <i>The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem</i>  <i>wrapped the foundations of 12 buildings with explosives.</i>  <i>In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges</i>  <i>and a few blocks will be reduced to smouldering rubble.</i>  <i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>  Two and a half

Well, I... She...  She had her first child last week
A girl
With... With her... With her new husband
Fuck
I'm glad for her
She deserves...  Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us
I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage
And that gives me strength
We give each other strength
It's time for the oneonones
Could you find a partner
<i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>  <i>His eyes already shrinkwrapped in tears.</i>  <i>Knees together
Bob
<i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>  <i>You know that chest expansion programme on latenight TV?</i>  <i>That was his idea.</i>  I was a juicer

Now we're going to open the green door, the heart chakra...  <i>I wasn't really dying.</i>  <i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>  <i>I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.</i>  Imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light

I am in a pretty lonely place

Thank you, Chloe
Everyone, let's thank Chloe
Thank you, Chloe
Now, let's ready ourselves for guided meditation
You step inside your cave and you walk...  <i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>  <i>Marla.</i>  <i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.</i>  <i>But you can't.</i>  <i>..deeper into your cave as you walk.</i>  <i>You feel a healing energy all around you.</i>  <i>Now find your power animal.</i>  Slide
OK. Let's partner up
Pick someone special to you tonight
Hey
We need to talk
What
Yeah
You're a faker
You're not dying
Sorry
But you're not dying the way Chloe is
So
So you're a tourist
I've seen you
I saw you at testicular cancer
I saw you practising this
Practising what
Telling me off
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert
I'll expose you
Go ahead
Come together
Let yourselves cry
Why are you doing this
It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee
Look, this is important
I've been coming for over a year
Why do you do it
I don't know
When people think you're dying, they listen to you instead of..
Yeah
Yeah
Share yourself... completely
Look, you don't want to get into this
It becomes an addiction
Really
I can't cry if another faker is present, and I need this
Candystripe a cancer ward
It's not my problem
No, wait a second
Hold on
We'll split up the week, OK
You take tuberculosis
My smoking doesn't go over at all
OK. Good
Testicular cancer should be no contest
Technically, I have more right to be there
You still have your balls
You're kidding
I dunno
Am I
No
What do you want
I'll take the parasites
Take the blood parasites
I want brain parasites
I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia
I want that
You can't have the whole brain
So far, you have four
OK. Take both the parasites
They're yours
Now we both have three...  Hey
What, are you selling those
Yes
I'm selling some clothes
So
We each have three
That's six
I want bowel cancer
<i>The girl had done her homework.</i>  No
No
That's your favorite too
Tried to slip it by me, eh
Look, we'll split it
Take the first and third Sunday
Deal
Let's not make a big thing out of it
Hey, Marla
Marla
Maybe we should exchange numbers
Should we
We might wanna switch nights
Who are you
Cornelius

<i>A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>  <i>The rear differential locks up.</i>  The teenager's braces are stuck to the ashtray

Yeah
I guess so
You know why they put oxygen masks on planes
Oxygen gets you high
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile
You accept your fate
It's all right here
Emergency water landing, 600mph
Blank faces
Calm as Hindu cows
That's...  That's an interesting theory
What do you do for a living
Why
So you can pretend you're interested
OK.  You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh
We have the exact same briefcase
Soap
Sorry
I make and I sell soap
Did you know if you mix gasoline and frozen orange juice, you can make napalm
No, I did not
Is that true
That's right
One can make all kinds of explosives with simple household items
Really
If one was so inclined
Everything on a plane is singleserving...  Oh, I get it
Very clever
How's it working out for you
What
Being clever
Keep it up, then
Right up
A question of etiquette
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch
<i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>  <i>Airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.</i>   Was it ticking
Sorry, throwers
Baggage handlers
But when a suitcase vibrates,  the throwers have got to call the police
My suitcase was vibrating
Nine times out of ten  it's an electric razor
But... every once in a while  it's a dildo
<i>We have to use the indefinite article, a dildo, never</i>  <i>your dildo.</i>  I don't own...  <i>I had everything in that suitcase
My CK shirts.</i>  <i>My DKNYshoes
My AX ties.</i>  <i>Never mind.</i>  Hey
<i>Home was a condo on the 15th floor</i>  <i>of a filing cabinet for widows and professionals.</i>  <i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>  <i>A foot of concrete is important</i>  <i>when your nextdoor neighbor has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>  <i>Or when a blast of debris that used to be your personal effects</i>  <i>blows out of your windows and sails flaming into the night.</i>  <i>I suppose these things happen.</i>  There's... nothing up there
You can't go into the unit
Do you have somebody you can call
<i>How embarrassing.</i>  <i>A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>  <i>The police later told me the pilot light might have gone out</i>  <i>letting out just a little bit of gas.</i>  <i>That gas could have filled the condo.</i>  <i>1700 square feet with high ceilings for days and days.</i>  <i>Then the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on.</i>  <i>Yeah?</i>  <i>I can hear you breathing...</i>  <i>If you ask me now, I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>  <i> Hello
Who's this?</i>  <i> Tyler
Who is this?</i>  We met... We met on the airplane
We had the same suitcase
The clever guy
<i>Oh, yeah
Right.</i>  I called a second ago
<i> I'm at a payphone
Yeah, I *69'd you
You're not gonna believe this
You know, it could be worse
A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep and toss it out of a car
I don't know
When you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that's it
That's the last sofa I'll need
I had it all
I had a stereo that was very decent
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable
I was close to being complete
Shit, man
Now it's all gone
All gone
Do you know what a duvet is
A comforter
It's a blanket
Just a blanket
Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is
No
What are we, then
I dunno
Right
We're consumers
We are byproducts of a lifestyle obsession
Murder, crime, poverty
These things don't concern me
Rogaine
Olestra
Martha Stewart
Fuck Martha Stewart
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic
It's all going down
So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns
I say stop being perfect
I say let's evolve
Let the chips fall where they may
But that's me, and I could be wrong
It's just stuff
Fuck, you're right
I don't smoke
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...  What
The things you own end up owning you
Do what you like, man
Oh, it's late
Hey, thanks for the beer
I should find a hotel
What
A hotel
Yeah
Just ask, man
What are you talking about
Oh, God
Three pitchers of beer and you still can't ask
What
Oh, hey
No, no, no
So just ask
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man
Would... Would that be a problem
Is it a problem for you to ask
Yeah
Thanks
I want you to do me a favor
I want you to hit me as hard as you can
What
I want you to hit me as hard as you can
<i>Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.</i>  <i>Tyler was a night person.</i>  While the rest of us slept, he worked
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel
It comes on a few
Someone has to switch the projectors at the exact moment  that one reel ends and the next one begins
You can see little dots come into the upper right corner of the screen
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns
That's the cue for a changeover
He flips the projectors, movie keeps going and the audience has no idea
Because it affords him interesting opportunities
Like splicing a frame of pornography into family films
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did
Nice, big cock
Even a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work
<i>He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.</i>  Do not watch
I cannot go when you watch
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque, he farted on meringues,  and as for the cream of mushroom soup...  Go ahead, tell 'em
You get the idea
You just want me to hit you
Come on
Why
I don't know
Never been in a fight
You
But that's a good thing
I don't wanna die without any scars
Come on
Hit me, before I lose my nerve
Oh, God
This is crazy
So go crazy
Let it rip
I don't know about this
Who gives a shit
Noone's watching
What do you care
This is crazy
That's right
Where
Like, in the face
This is so fucking stupid
Motherfucker
He hit me in the ear
Well, Jesus, I'm sorry
Why the ear, man
I fucked it up
No, that was perfect
No, it's all right
Right
Hit me again
No, you hit me
We should do this again sometime
Where's your car
<i>I don't know how Tyler found that house</i>  <i>but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>  <i>It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.</i>  <i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>  <i>There was no lock on the front door from when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.</i>  <i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>  <i>I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.</i>  <i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>  Yep
That's you
That's me
That's the toilet
Yeah, thanks
<i>What a shithole.</i>  <i>Nothing worked.</i>  <i>Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.</i>  <i>There were no neighbors
Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>  <i>That fart smell of steam
The hamstercage smell of wood chips.</i>  What have we here
Hey, guys
<i>Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.</i>  <i>By the end of the first month, I didn't miss TV.</i>  <i>I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.</i>  Can I be next
All right, man
Lose the tie
What are you reading
Listen to this
It's an article written by an organ in the first person
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata
There's a whole series of these
"I Am Jill's Nipples.
"I Am Jack's Colon.
"I Get Cancer
I Kill Jack.
<i>After fighting, everything else in life got the volume turned down.</i>  What
<i> You could deal with anything
Have you finished those reports?</i>  <i>If you could choose, who would you fight?</i>  I'd fight my boss, probably
Yeah, why
Who would you fight
I don't know my dad
I mean, I know him, but..
He left when I was like, six years old
Married this other woman and had some other kids
He did this every six years
He changes city and starts a new family
My dad never went to college
So it was real important that I go
That sounds familiar
Call him up longdistance and say, "Dad, now what?
Same here
Now I'm 25
Make my yearly call again
"Dad, now what?
He says, "I dunno
Get married.
You can't get married
We're a generation of men raised by women
<i>Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>  <i>But every Saturday night, we were finding something out.</i>  <i>We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.</i>  <i>It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>  <i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>  <i>I should have been looking for a new condo or haggling with my insurance company.</i>  <i>I should have been upset about my nice flaming little shit.</i>  <i>But I wasn't.</i>  The premise of cybernetting an office is make things more efficient
<i>Monday mornings, I just thought about next week.</i>  Can I get the icon in cornflower blue
Absolutely
Efficiency is priority No.1, people
Because waste is a thief
I showed this to my man here
You liked it, didn't you
Turn off the jukebox
Lock the back
<i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.</i>  Gentlemen
The first rule of Fight Club is  you do not talk about Fight Club
The second rule of Fight Club is  you do not talk about Fight Club
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,  the fight is over
Fourth rule
Only two guys to a fight
Fifth rule
One fight at a time, fellas
No shirts
No shoes
Seventh rule
Fights will go on as long as they have to
And the eighth and final rule
If this is your first night at Fight Club  you have to fight
<i>You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.</i>  <i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>  <i>Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight,</i>  <i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>  <i>Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were outside of it.</i>  <i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>  <i>After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.</i>  If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight
Doesn't matter
Who'd be tough
Hemingway
Shatner
I'd fight William Shatner
<i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>  <i>Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up.</i>  <i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>  <i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>  Is that what a man looks like
Oh, selfimprovement is masturbation
Now, selfdestruction..
Excuse me
Stop
<i>When the fight was over, nothing was solved.</i>  <i>But nothing mattered.</i>  Cool
<i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>  Hey, man
How about next week
How about next month?
Irvine, you're in the middle
<i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>  He fell down some stairs
<i>Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>  OK. Any historical figure
I'd fight Gandhi
Good answer
How about you
Lincoln
Big guy, big reach
Skinny guys fight till they're burger
Fuck
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart
<i>Where have you been the last eight weeks?</i>  <i>Marla?</i>  <i> How did you find me
You left a forwarding number.</i>  I haven't seen you at any support groups
<i>We split 'em up
That was the idea
How do you know
I cheated
I found a new one
Really
It's for men only
Like the testicle thing
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous
<i> They're really fuckedup people..
I've got a stomach full of Xanax
I took what was left of a bottle
It might have been too much
<i>Picture Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.</i>  This isn't a forreal suicide thing
This is probably a cryforhelp thing
So you're staying in tonight, then
I'd been here for two months and his door was never closed.</i>  You won't believe this dream I had last night
I can hardly believe anything about last night
What are you doing here
What
This is my house
What are you doing here
Oh, you've got some fuckedup friends
Limber, though
Silly cooze
Phone's off the hook
Guess who's on the other end
<i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>  <i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>  Do you think it'll live up to its name
<i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>  <i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>  <i>Ten,</i>  <i>nine,... eight...</i>  <i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i>  <i>think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>  <i>Five,</i>  <i>four...</i>  Hang on
Did I call you
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic
Oh, don't worry
It's not a threat to you
Oh, fuck
Somebody called the cops
End of the hall
She has lost faith in herself
Miss Singer, let us help you
She's a monster
You have every reason to live
She's infectious human waste
Miss Singer
Good luck trying to save her
If I fall asleep,  I'm done for
Unfuckingbelievable
No, I didn't
Never
No
You're not into her, are you
God, not at all
<i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>  Are you sure
You can tell me
Believe me, I'm sure
<i> Put a gun to my head and spray my brains
That's good.</i>  She's a predator posing as a house pet
The shit that came out of this woman's mouth, I had never heard
I haven't been fucked like that since grade school
<i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>  <i>The other night, he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.</i>  Marla doesn't need a lover, just a caseworker
Or a wash
This isn't love, it's sport fucking
<i>She invaded my support groups and now my home.</i>  Hey, hey
Now, listen
I can't have you talking to her about me
Why would I...  Say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or anybody,... we're done
You promise
OK.   Yeah, I promise
Promise
I just said, I promise
<i>If only I had wasted a few minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>  <i>none of this would have happened.</i>  Harder, yes
Oh, harder, harder
<i>I could have moved to another room.</i>  <i>On the third floor where I might not have heard them.</i>  <i>But I didn't.</i>   What are you doing
Just going to bed
Wanna finish her off
No
No, thank you
Who were you talking to
Shut up
<i>I became the calm little center of the world.</i>  <i>I was the Zen master.</i>  <i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>  <i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>  Is that your blood
You can't smoke in here
Take the rest of the day off
Come back Monday with some clean clothes
Get yourself together
<i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.</i>  <i>"Yes, these are bruises from fighting
"</i>  <i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that
This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.</i>  <i>We have some new information about the incident at your former condo.</i>  Yes
I don't know if you're aware, but someone sprayed Freon into your frontdoor lock
<i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>  No, I wasn't aware of that
<i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>  Does this sound strange to you
<i>Yes, sir, strange
<i> Do you know what this means
No, what does it mean?</i>  It means it was homemade
I'm sorry
This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown out your pilot light days before the explosion
<i> The gas was just a detonator
Who would go and do that?</i>  <i> I'll ask the questions
<i>Excuse me
Are you there?</i>  I am listening
It's hard to know what to make of this
Have you recently made enemies who might have access to homemade dynamite
<i> Son, this is serious
Yes, I know it's serious.</i>  <i> I mean that
Yes, it's very serious.</i>  Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me
That condo was my life
OK
I loved every stick of furniture in that place
I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>  <i> Is this not a good time for you
Just tell him you fucking did it!</i>  Tell him you blew it all up
That's what he wants to hear
Wait
Are you saying that I'm a suspect?</i>  No
I may need to talk to you, so you let me know if you're gonna leave town
OK.</i>  <i>Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.</i>  <i>My parents pulled this exact same act for years.</i>  The condom is the glass slipper of our generation
You slip one on when you meet a stranger
You... dance all night
Then you throw it away
Not the stranger
What
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1
It was worth every penny
Someone loved it intensely  for one day
Then tossed it
Like a Christmas tree
So special
Then  bam
It's on the side of the road
Tinsel still clinging to it
Like a sex crime victim
Bound with electrical tape
Well then, it suits you
You can borrow it sometime
<i> What
You get rid of her
Don't mention me.</i>  <i>I am six years old again, passing messages between parents.</i>   I really think it's time you left
Don't worry, I'm leaving
Not that we don't love your visits
Gotta get off  Thanks
Bye
Gotta get off of this merrygoround  Gonna get, need to get...  Gotta get...  You kids
Why do you still waste time with her
I'll say this about Marla
<i>At least she's trying to hit bottom.</i>  And I'm not
Feathers up your butt do not make you a chicken
Tonight... we make soap
To make soap, first we render fat
The salt balance has to be just right  so the best fat for soap comes from humans
Wait, what is this place
A liposuction clinic
Pay dirt
Richest, creamiest fat in the world
No
Don't pull it, don't pull it
Oh, God
As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface
Like in Boy Scouts
It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout
Keep stirring
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust, you've got dynamite
Yeah, with enough soap, one could blow up just about anything
<i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>  People found clothes got cleaner when washed at a certain point in the river
You know why
Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river
Bodies burnt
Water permeated the ashes to create lye
The crucial ingredient
Once it mixed with the melted body fat, a white soapy discharge crept into the river
May I see your hand, please
This is a chemical burn
It will hurt more than any burn and it will leave a scar
<i>Meditation worked for cancer, it could work now.</i>   Don't shut the pain out
Oh, God
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes, like the first monkey shot into space
Without pain or sacrifice, we would have nothing
<i>I tried not to think of the word searing of flesh.</i>  Stop it
This is your pain, this is your burning hand
No
Don't deal with this the way those dead people do
I get the point
No
You're feeling premature enlightenment
It's the greatest moment of your life, and you're off somewhere else
Shut up
Our fathers were our models for God
If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God
Listen to me
You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you
He never wanted you
This is not the worst thing that can happen
We don't need Him
Fuck damnation, fuck redemption
We are God's unwanted children
I'm getting water
You can use water and make it worse or...   Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn
Please let me up
First, you have to give up
First, you have to know, not fear,  know that some day, you're gonna die
You don't know how this feels
OK.  Congratulations
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom
<i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar.</i>  <i>God knows what they charged.</i>   This is the best soap
Why, thank you, Susan
<i>I'm halfasleep again
I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>  "The second rule..." Is this yours
Pretend you're me
Make a managerial decision
What would you do
Well, I gotta tell you,  I'd be very, very careful who you talk to about that
And this buttondown, Oxfordcloth psycho might just snap  and then stalk from office to office  with an Armalite AR10 carbine gaspowered semiautomatic weapon,  pumping round after round into colleagues and coworkers
This might be someone you've known for years
Someone very, very close to you
<i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>  <i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>  Or maybe you shouldn't bring me every piece of trash you pick up
Compliance and Liability
My tit's gonna rot off
Will you excuse me
What do you mean
I need you to check for a lump in my breast
Go to a hospital
I can't afford to waste money on a doctor
Please
<i>She didn't call Tyler
I'm neutral in her book.</i>  That's nice
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines
Where are they, exactly
I'm alive and I'm in poverty
Want any
No, no
Thanks for the thought
What happened to your hand
Oh, nothing
Right there
Feel anything
Well, make sure
OK, I'm pretty sure
No, nothing
Well, that's a relief
Thank you
No problem
I wish I could return the favor
I could check your prostate
I think I'm OK.  Well, thanks, anyway
Are we done
Yeah, we're done
See you... around
Cornelius
It's me
Hey, Bob
We all thought you were dead
Still here
How are you, Bob
Better than I've ever been in my whole life
Really
Still remaining men together
No, no
Really, what is it
Well..
The first rule is, I'm not supposed to talk about it
And the second rule is  I'm not supposed to talk about it
And the third rule is...  Bob, Bob
I'm a member
That's fucking... fucking great
I've never seen you there
I go Tuesdays and Thursdays
I go Saturday
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right
Have you heard about the guy that invented it
Yeah, actually..
Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution  and he sleeps only one hour a night
He's a great man
Do you know about Tyler Durden
I didn't hurt you, did I
Actually, you did
<i>Fight Club.</i>  <i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>  <i>Our gift to the world.</i>  I look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces
Shut up
Which means a lot of people have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club
I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived
I see all this potential
Goddamn it, an entire generation pumping gas
Waiting tables
Slaves with white collars
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes
Working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need
We're the middle children of history
We have no Great War
No Great Depression
Our great war is a spiritual war
We've all been raised on television to believe  that one day we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars
But we won't
And we're very, very pissed off
Yeah
First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...  Who are you
Who am I
There's a sign on the front that says Lou's Tavern
I'm fucking Lou
Who the fuck are you
Tyler Durden
Who told you motherfuckers that you could use my place
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone
He don't own this place
I do
How much money's he getting for this
There is no money
Free to all
Ain't that something
Look, stupid fuck
Hey
You should join our club
Did you hear what I just said
You and your friend
You hear me now
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou
Still not getting it
I got it, I got it
Shit, I lost it
Back
All of you
Ah, Lou
Come on, man
We really like this place
Get it out
Oh, yeah
Is that fucking funny
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you
Unbelievable
You don't know where I've been, Lou
Oh, my God
Please let us keep it, Lou
Please, Lou
Fucking use the basement
Christ
I want your word, Lou
On my mother's eyes
Thanks, Lou
We'll see you next week
This week, each one of you has a homework assignment
You're gonna go out
You're gonna start a fight with a total stranger
You're gonna start a fight  and you're gonna lose
Hey
Watch out, jackass
Come on
<i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>  Son of a bitch
<i>Most people, normal people, do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>  Excuse me
That's not necessary...  Jay
Go call 911
Put the hose down
Stop it
Stop it
We need to talk
With your constant absenteeism
With your unpresentable appearance
You're up for review
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise
Let's pretend
You're the Department of Transportation, OK
Someone informs you that this company  installs frontseat mounting brackets that failed collision tests,  brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,  and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive
What then
Are you threatening me
You're fired
I have a better solution
Keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant
In exchange for my salary,  my job will be never to tell people these things that I know
I don't even have to come into the office
I can do this job from home
<i> Security
I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>  What the hell are you doing
Why would you do that
Oh, my God
No
Please stop
Oh, God, no
Please
No
<i>For some reason, I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>  No
Give me the paychecks, like I asked, and you won't ever see me again
<i>Then, at our most excellent moment together...</i>  Thank God
<i>Telephone, computer,</i>  <i>fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>  <i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>  <i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.</i>  <i>Now, the center of Fight Club became the two men fighting.</i>  <i>The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness.</i>  <i>Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel</i>  <i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>  <i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>  Thank you, sir
<i>Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.</i>  <i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>   There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City
Yeah, I heard
There's one in Penns Grove too
Did you start that one
No, I thought you did
No
Stop for a second
Hey, what are we doing
What are we doing
Homework assignment
What kind
Human sacrifice
Is that a gun
It's a gun
What are you doing
Don't fuck around
Meet me in the back
<i>On a long enough time line,</i>  <i>the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>  What are you doing
Come on
Hands behind your back
Raymond K Hessel
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A
Small, cramped basement apartment
How did you know
Raymond
You're going to die
No
Is that your mom and dad
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor
Know why
There'll be nothing left of your face
Oh, come on
An expired community college student ID
What did you study, Raymond
Stuff
I asked you what you studied
Biology, mostly
Why
I don't know
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?
The question, Raymond, was what did you want to be
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus
Veterinarian
Animals
Yeah
Animals and stuff
Yeah, I got that
So you need more schooling
Too much school
No, please...  You'd rather die here, on your knees, in the back of a convenience store
Please, no
Gonna check in on you
I know where you live
If you're not working to be a veterinarian in six weeks,  you will be dead
Now run on home
I feel ill
Imagine how he feels
Come on, this isn't funny
What the fuck was the point of that?
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K Hessel's life
His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted
<i>You had to give it to him.</i>  <i> Come on
He had a plan.</i>  <i>And it started to make sense in a Tylersort of way.</i>  <i>No fear
You're not the car you drive
You're not the contents of your wallet
You are the allsinging, alldancing crap of the world
I'll be out of your way in a sec
You don't have to go
Whatever
No, I mean..
Yeah
Wow, Chloe
When did that happen
Do you care
I dunno
Yeah, well..
It was the smart move on her part
Listen...  What are you getting out of all this
What
Why do you keep...  Is this making you happy
Yeah, well, sometimes
I don't know
I don't understand
Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person
What do you get out of it
No... That's not the same thing at all
It's totally different with us
Us
What do you mean by us
I'm sorry
Do you hear this
All that noise
Hold on
Don't change the subject
I want to talk about this
You're not talking about me, are you
What
Playing doctor
What was going on there
What are you talking about
Nothing
Nothing
I don't think so
Look at me
What
What is that?
It's nothing
Don't worry
My God
Who did this
Guy or girl
What do you care
What do you care if I ask
Leave me alone
You're afraid to say
Let me go
Talk to me
Let go of me
This conversation  This conversation   is over
is over
Hey, this is getting a little old
What is... What is all this
What do you think
Hey, why do we need bunk beds
Hey
Too young
What's all that
If the applicant is young, tell him he's too young
Old, too old
Fat, too fat
If the applicant waits three days without food or shelter,  he may enter and begin training
Training for what
You think this is a game
You're too young to train here, end of story
Get the fuck out of here
Bad news, friend
It's not gonna happen
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding
Just... go away
Go
You're trespassing and I will have to call the police
Don't you look at me
Never
Now get the fuck off my porch
Get off my porch
<i>Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>  I'm gonna go inside and I'm gonna get a shovel
Yes, sir
Two pair of black pants
Yes, sir
One pair black boots
Black socks
Yes, sir
$300 personal burial money
Yes, sir
All right
You're too old, fat man
Get the fuck off my porch
Bob
Bob
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space
Space monkey
Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good
You are too fucking old, fatty
Get out of here, the both of you
You are not special
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake
You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else
<i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>  <i>We are the allsinging, alldancing crap of the world.</i>  <i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>  <i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>  <i>To what purpose?</i>  <i>For what greater good?</i>  <i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>  When he was like, "You are not yourjob",  I was like, "Yeah!
Hey
OK
What's going on
What are we celebrating
Go on
Hey
Let me get that for you
<i>Investigators are here
The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>  <i>Could you tell us what you think has happened here?</i>  <i>We believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism in the city</i>  <i>somehow related to underground boxing clubs.</i>  <i>We will be coordinating a rigorous investigation.</i>  <i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs who just arrived on the scene</i>  <i> of a fouralarm fire that broke out...  She's hot.</i>  <i>Back to you in the studio.</i>   Yeah
Yeah
Holy shit
Yeah
What the fuck did you guys do
<i>Arson investigators are on the premises...</i>  Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir
It will take dedication and commitment and, most of all, cooperation
Streets are safer now
There is hope in the inner city
I gotta take a piss
These are the first steps in a long journey
That is why we have created Project Hope
Bob
Project Hope will be ajoint effort  between the police and community leaders
Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack
Hi
You're gonna call off your rigorous investigation
You will publicly state there is no underground group or  these guys are gonna take your balls
<i>They'll send one to the New York Times and one to the LA Times.</i>  Look
The people you are after are the people you depend on
We cook your meals
We connect your calls
We drive your ambulances
We guard you while you sleep
Do not fuck with us
Ball check
Let's go
<i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>  Hey
<i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i>  <i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>  <i>I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers</i>  <i>and smother those French beaches I'd never see.</i>  <i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>  Where did you go, psycho boy
I felt like destroying something beautiful
Get him to a fucking hospital
Don't worry, Mr Durden
Airport parking
Long term
After you, Mr Durden
Something on your mind, dear
No
Yeah, why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem
First rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions
Why didn't you include me in the beginning
Fight Club was the beginning
We started Fight Club together
Remember
It's as much mine as it is yours
Yeah
Weren't we doing this together
This does not belong to us
We are not special
Fuck that
You should have told me
Hey, Tyler
What do you want?
A statement of purpose
Oh...  You decide your level of involvement
I will
I wanna know certain things first
The first rule of Project Mayhem..
I wanna know what you're thinking
Fuck what you know
Forget about what you think you know about life, friendship,  and especially about you and me
What are you doing
What do you wish you'd done before you died
Paint a selfportrait
Build a house
And you
Nothing
Get in the right lane
You have to know
If you died now, how would you feel about your life
I don't know
Nothing good
Come on
Stop fucking around
Tyler
Jesus Christ
Goddamn it
Goddamn it
Fuck you
Fuck Marla
I am sick of all your shit
OK, man
Quit screwing around
Look at you
Steer
Look at you
You're fucking pathetic
Why
What are you talking about
Why do you think I blew up your condo
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat
It's not a goddamned seminar
Stop trying to control everything and just let go
Let go
All right
Fine
We've just had a nearlife experience
In the world I see,  you're stalking elk through the Grand Canyon forests  around the ruins of Rockefeller Center
You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower
Feel better, champ
<i>And then...</i>  Tyler
<i>..Tyler was gone.</i>  <i>Was I asleep?</i>  <i>Had I slept?</i>  You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...  <i>The house had become a living thing.</i>  <i>Wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.</i>  <i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>  <i>Planet Tyler.</i>  <i>I had to hug the walls.</i>  <i>Trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>  You shouldn't be smoking in here
You know how much ether is here
<i>Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.</i>  Hang on a second
It's under control, sir
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not..
Right... OK.  <i>I'm all alone.</i>  <i>My father dumped me
Tyler dumped me.</i>  <i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>  <i>What comes next in Project Mayhem only Tyler knows.</i>  <i>The second rule is you do not ask questions.</i>  Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away
The Paper Street Soap Company
Can I come in
He's not here
What
Tyler isn't here
Tyler's gone
Get some help
Make some fucking room
What happened
What happened
We were on assignment
Destroy a piece of corporate art...  Operation Latte Thunder
Go
..and trash a franchise coffee bar
We had it all worked out, sir
It went smooth until...  Police
Freeze
They shot Bob
They shot him in the head
Fucking pigs
Those motherfuckers
You morons
What did you think was gonna happen?
OK, quick
Get rid of the evidence
We gotta get rid of this body
Bury him
Take him to the garden and bury him
Come on, people, let's go
Get the fuck off
What are you talking about
This isn't fucking evidence
This is a person
He's my friend and you're not burying him in the garden
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir
This is Bob
Sir, in..
Now, you listen to me
Robert Paulsen
He's a man  and he's dead now because of us
Do you understand that
I understand
In death, a member of Project Mayhem  has a name
His name... is Robert Paulsen
His name is Robert Paulsen
Come on, guys
Please
Stop it
His name is Robert Paulsen
This is all over with
Get the fuck out of here
No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit
I need to see you...  <i>I went to all the cities on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.</i>  <i>I didn't know how or why, but I could look at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>  <i>I'm looking for Tyler Durden
It's very important that I talk to him.</i>  I wish I could help you,  sir
Hey
Taxi
Look at my face
I'm a member
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler
I'm not exposed to bespeak any such information to you  nor would I, even if I had said information at this juncture,... be able
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
<i>Tyler had been busy... setting up franchises all over the country.</i>  <i>Was I asleep
Had I slept?</i>  <i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>   We've just heard the stories
What kind of stories
Nobody knows what he looks like
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard
Is it true about Fight Club in Miami
Is Mr Durden building an army
Welcome back, sir
How have you been
Is this a test, sir
No
This is not a test
You were in here last Thursday
You were standing where you are now, asking how good security is
It's tight as a drum, sir
Who do you think I am
Are you sure this isn't a test
No, this is not a test
You're Mr Durden
You're the one who gave me this
<i>Please return your seat backs to their full upright and locked position.</i>  <i> Yeah
Done what?</i>  Had sex
What kind of stupid question is that
<i> Is this a trick
No
I need to know...</i>  You wanna know if I think we were just having sex or making love
Is that what you're calling it?</i>  Just answer the question
Did we do it or not?
You fuck me, then snub me
You love me, you hate me
You're sensitive, then you turn into an asshole
<i>We just lost cabin pressure.</i>  What did you just say
What is wrong with you
Say my name
Tyler Durden
You fucking freak
I'm coming over
You broke your promise
Jesus, Tyler
You fucking talked to her about me
What the fuck is going on
I asked you for one thing
One simple thing
Why do people think that I'm you
Answer me
Answer me
I think you know
No, I don't
Yes, you do
Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me
I don't know
You got it
No
Do not fuck with us
Say it
Because...  Say it
Because we're the same person
<i>We are the allsinging, alldancing crap.</i>   I don't understand this
You wanted a way to change your life
All the ways you wish you could be,  that's me
I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,  I'm free in all the ways that you are not
Oh, no
Tyler went away
What
This is crazy
People do it every day
They talk to themselves
They see themselves as they'd like to be
They don't have the courage you have to just run with it
You still wrestle with it, so sometimes you're still you
We should do this again sometime
At times, you imagine you're watching me
Little by little, you're just letting yourself become  Tyler Durden
You are not yourjob or how much money you have
You have a house
Rented in your name
You have jobs, a life
You work nights because you can't sleep
Or you stay up and make soap
Technically, you are
It's all the same to her
Oh, my God
Now you see our dilemma
She knows too much
What... What are you saying
This is bullshit
You are insane
No
We simply do not have time for this crap
<i>It's called a changeover.</i>  <i>The movie goes on</i>  <i>and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>   Sir
Are you checking out
Yeah
Can you initial this list of phone calls
When were these made
Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning
<i>Have I been going to bed earlier every night
<i>D茅j脿 vu all over again.</i>  With enough soap, one could blow up anything
Oh, my God
<i> 1888.  Who am I calling?</i>  <i>1888 Franklin
This is maintenance
<i>Yes
Can I help you?</i>  <i> Hello
Yeah, yeah.</i>  I need to talk to your supervisor right away
<i> Speaking
OK, listen to me.</i>  Something terrible is about to happen to your building
Don't worry about us, sir
We're solid.</i>  <i>2160.</i>  Marla
Marla
Hey, wait
Wait
Marla
Marla
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom
They almost broke my arm
This needs a tremendous act of faith on your part, but hear me out
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit
A little more faith than that
I don't wanna hear anything you have to say
You have every right to be..
I'll just have a coffee, thanks
Anything you order is free of charge, sir
Why is it free of charge
Whatever
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie
Clean food, please
In that case, may I advise against the clam chowder
Thank you
You got about 30 seconds
I know I've been acting very strange, OK
I know it seems there's two sides to me...  Two sides
You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass
I know
What
The nature of our relationship wasn't clear  to me for reasons I won't go into
Whatever
No, no
Fifteen seconds, please
Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry
You do
I really do
I care about you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you because of me
What
You need to leave town for a while
Get out of any major city
Just go camping...  You're an insane person
No
No
Shut up
You're not safe
Shut up
I really tried
I know you did
You're smart, funny
You're spectacular in bed
But  you're intolerable
Deepseated problems for which you should seek professional help
I know, and I'm sorry
You're sorry, I'm sorry
Everyone's sorry
I can't do this any more
I can't
And I won't
You can't leave, Marla
You're not safe
Marla, you don't understand
Marla, I am trying to protect you
Let go
I don't ever wanna see you again
That's fine..
Here, wait right here
Hold it right there
Take this money and get on this bus
Shut up
Please get on the bus
Please get on the bus
Why are you doing this
They think you're a threat
I can't explain it now, just trust me
If I know where you are, you won't be safe
Remember, stay out of major cities
Tyler
You're the worst thing that ever happened to me
Hello
I need you to arrest me
In the metropolitan area, we had probably 200 members
Chapters have sprung up in five or six other major cities already
This is a tightlyregimented organization  with many cells capable of operating independent of central leadership
Go to the house, OK
That's our headquarters
In the back, buried in the garden,  you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen
In the basement, you're gonna find some bathtubs  that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin
I believe the plan is to blow up  the headquarters of these credit card companies  and the TRW building
Why these buildings
Why credit card companies
If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero
Keep him talking
I need to make a phone call
I really admire what you're doing
You're a brave man to order this
You're a genius, sir
Don't fight
It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden
It will set an example
You're making a big mistake
I'm not Tyler Durden
You told us you'd say that too
All right
I am Tyler Durden
Listen to me
We're aborting this mission now
You said you would definitely say that
Are you fucking out of your minds
You're police officers
Is somebody timing this
Shit
Some of this information checks out
Be right there
Hey, wait
I got him
Sir, we have to do this
Stop fighting
Where's the rubber band
Get away from me
Back up
Face down on the floor right now
Get down on the floor
The first person that comes out of this door  gets a lead salad
Get away
Stay away
<i>I ran.</i>  <i>I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>  <i>Then I ran some more.</i>  What the fuck are you doing
Running around in your underpants
No
I know what's going on here
Come on, then
I got us a great place to watch from
Oh, Christ
Now what are you doing
I'm stopping this
Why
The greatest thing you've ever done
I can't let this happen
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder
The buildings are empty
We're not killing anyone
We're setting 'em free
Bob is dead
You wanna make an omelette, you gotta break some eggs
No
You're not even there
I wouldn't do that
Not unless you knew which wires were what
If you know, I know
Oh, heavens, no
Not the green one
Pull any one but the green one
I asked you not to do that
Fuck
Tyler, get away from the van
Tyler, I'm not kidding
Goddamn it
OK.  You are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend  near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin
Come on
Don't go
What?
Three minutes
This is it
The beginning
<i>I think this is about where we came in.</i>  Do you have a speech for the occasion
I'm sorry
Flashback humor
It's getting exciting now
Two and a half
Think of everything we've accomplished
One step closer to economic equilibrium
Why is she here
Tying up loose ends
I beg you, please don't do this
I'm not doing this
<i> We are doing this
This is what we want
Right
Except you is meaningless now
We have to forget about you
You're a voice in my head
You're a voice in mine
Why can't I get rid of you
You need me
I don't
I really don't any more
I didn't create some loser alter ego to make me feel better
Take some responsibility
I do
So, please, I'm begging you, please call this off
Have I ever let us down
How far have you come because of me?
As always, I will carry you kicking and screaming  and in the end you will thank me
Tyler
Tyler
I'm grateful to you
For everything that you've done for me
But this is too much
I don't want this
Your shitjob back
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms
I won't do it
This can't be happening
It's already done, so shut up
60 seconds till CRI
I can figure this out
This isn't even real
You're not real, that gun... That gun isn't even in your hand
The gun's in my hand
It doesn't change a thing
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head
Not my head, Tyler
Our head
Interesting
Hey
It's you and me
Friends
Tyler,  I want you to really listen to me
OK.  My eyes are open
What's that smell
Oh, no
What's going on
Oh, my God
Are you... Are you all right, sir
What happened
Nothing, it's no problem
No, no, no, sir
He's not kidding
You look awful
I'm fine
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine
Stop it
Let her go
Christ Almighty
You
Leave her with me
Are you sure
Yes, I'm sure
You fucker
What kind of sick fucking game are you playing at?
Yeah, I know
What happened
Don't ask
You're shot
Yes, I'm shot
Oh, my God
I can't believe he's standing
Who did this
I did, actually
Find some gauze
You shot yourself
Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me
You met me at a very strange time in my life
﻿1 When I think of my wife..
I always think of her head
I picture cracking her lovely skull...  Unspooling her brains..
Trying to get answers
The primal questions of any marriage
"What are you thinking?
"What have we done to each other?
His majesty prefers not to be moistened
I got you a present
I hated this game
You loved it
You loved it
Thank you
Can you pour me a bourbon
What's up, jitters
Well, if you're not going to talk, I'm gonna have to fill the silence...  With another excruciating story by margo dunne
I like that one
Or how about the time I saw that woman who looked exactly like my friend Monica
But it wasn't Monica
Who was also named Monica
Made it kind of interesting
It's great
I'm just having a bad day
It's our anniversary
Five years
Five
That came fast
And furious
I met a boy
A great, sweet, gorgeous, coolass guy
Excuse me, miss
I just want you to be careful...  Where you put down that monkbrewed Belgian wheat beer...  Because the party's down to three beast lights and a bottle of pucker
It might attract some desperate characters
It could
They already relieved me of my artisanal meat platter
Finally, someone tells me how to pronounce that word
"Meat"
Yes, "meat.
One syllable
Whose beer am I about to drink
Don't tell me
Let's see, who's your type
I don't see you sitting quietly..
Uhoh
Is that him
Ironic hipster, so selfaware, he makes everything a joke
What type are you
Cornfed, saltoftheearth Missouri guy
Cute
Native new yorker
The world ends at the Hudson
What's your name
Amy
Well, Amy, who are you
B, I'm a moderately influential warlord
C, I write personality quizzes for magazines
Your hands are far too delicate for real scrimshaw work...  And I happen to be a charter subscriber to middling warlord weekly..
So I'd recognize you
I'm gonna go with "c."  And you
Who are you
I'm the guy to save you from all this awesomeness
So, you write for a men's magazine
No
It's what to wear, what to drink
How to bullshit
Never with you
Ha, ha
Why
I think it's your chin
My chin
Yeah, it's quite villainous
Okay, how's this
A hundred percent true, no bullshit
Okay
We all move to New York...  And we end up living in these little cubby holes, and that's not it
You have to see this
Hey
Hey
I have to kiss you now
Is that right
I can't let you go through a sugar storm unkissed
Wait a second
Nick dunne..
I really like you
So, is Amy gonna do one of those anniversary...  Treasure hunts
You mean the forced march designed to prove...  What an oblivious and uncaring asshole her husband is
Wow
I don't remember the point
Spin
What was the clue last year she got so mad about
"When your poor Amy has a cold...  "This dessert just must be sold.
The answer
I still don't know the answer, go
A few years ago, you'd have known
A few years ago, it was fun
She got me a beautiful notebook
Told me to go write my novel
What did you get her
She'd never flown a kite
Okay
Anyway
Year four, flowers
She led me outside to the dying rosebush in the backyard
Yeah
Wood
So, what did you get her
There's no good gift for wood
I know
"There's some wood for you, bitch.
The bar
Why, yes
Hang on one second
Hey, it's watchful Wally
What's going on
Thanks very much
All right, byebye
Hey, buddy
What are you doing out here
Thanks, Walt
Ame
Amy
Come on in
Hey
Mister dunne
Hi
I'm detective Rhonda boney
We understand there are concerns about your wife
And I came home to this
Now, I don't panic easily..
But it's weird, right
Mind if we look around
Please
Two years in September
We used to live in New York
City
Yeah, I was a writer
We were both writers
Why did you all move back here
My mom got sick
She's dead
I'm so sorry
What do you do now, for work
My sister margo and I own the bar downtown
Oh, the bar
Love the name
Very meta
Pretty things
Stay
My office, here
Date night
It's our anniversary
It's a guest bedroom, there
Cat's room on the end
I checked up here
This is my wife's office
Amy's office
Wow
Impressive gal
Yeah
I loved these books
Wait a minute
Your wife is amazing Amy
Yeah
She is
AmazingfuckingAmy is getting fucking married
That's how the night started
With me, regular, flawed, real Amy, jealous, as always, of the golden child
Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy, who's getting fucking married
When I was 10, I quit cello
In the next book, amazing Amy became a prodigy
Did you play volleyball
She made varsity
When did you have a dog
Puddles made her more relatable
Wow
But they really can be assholes
Nick
Sir
Hey, thanks for coming, man
No problem
Hey, sweetheart
Big night for your mom
It would mean so much if you would talk to a few reporters...  Bloggers, give them a little Amy color
We can't stay long
Fantastic
This is why I have my brownstone
My trust fund
I know I can't complain
Your parents literally plagiarized your childhood
No, they improved upon it, and then peddled it to the masses
I thought you were gonna wear white to match the wedding theme
I know how this ends
Don't tell me
You're very cute, Nick
Amy, you know what would make dad's night
I'm on it
I love having strangers pick at my scabs
I'm curious whether..
It's difficult for you to see amazing Amy heading down the aisle
Because it's my understanding you are not married
Correct
Amazing Amy has always been one step ahead of me
Excuse me
I'm sorry, I just have a few questions
It's you
I'm here in a strictly journalistic capacity
Two magical years
Two magical years
In the course of that time, you've had the opportunity...  To perform such gracious gestures as...  Not correcting Nick when he pronounced "quinoa" as "kweenoa.
An understandable mistake
He thinks velveeta is a cheese
You also manage to appear shocked and delighted..
When Nick's elderly mother breaks into an impromptu rendition...  Of New York, New York, every time she sees you
You also bought Nick his very first pair of scissors
And matching stapler
Amy elliott, you are more than amazing
You are brilliant, yet entirely unsnobby
You challenge me
And, fun fact for the readers...  You have a worldclass vagina
My colleagues tell me that you are not yet married
Is that correct
I'm not
And then..
The night wasn't so bad anymore
And it's done
Crossed off the list
But given the scene at your house...  And given our spike in violent crime of late...  We are gonna take this very, very seriously
Good
We've got forensics over at your place
You got somewhere to stay
I could stay at my sister's
Okay
We will organize searches, put up flyers
We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow
You're having a press conference
I wanna get the word out, right
Yeah, it's just all of a sudden, I feel like I'm on a law & order episode
But, that said, do you wanna wait and call a lawyer
Absolutely not
I just wanna help
So, you and Amy have been here two years
You tend bar..
I own the bar
No kids
Not yet
So, what does Amy do most days
I don't know
She keeps busy
Doing what
She's a voracious reader
Well, days can get long
I know a few housewives, that evening glass of wine starts coming at noon
Or prescription pills
Nice lady
Got her teeth kicked in over some oxycontin
Ever since that mall went bust, half the town is out of work
We cannot keep up with the drug violence
I'm pretty sure that's not it
No, not really
No friends
She was very close with my mom, before she passed away
You know, we have a pretty serious homeless problem..
In our neighborhood
We'll look into that
You got to the bar around 11:00 today
Where were you before that
Just to cross that out
Well, I was home
I went to Sawyer beach and read the news
Did you visit with anyone there
I kind of go to Sawyer beach for the solitude
So, your wife has no friends here
Is she kinda standoffish
Ivy league
Rubs people the wrong way
She's got very high standards
Type a
That can make you crazy if you're not like that
You seem pretty laidback
Speaking of which, Amy's blood type
God, I don't know
I'd have to look it up at the house
You don't know if she has friends, you don't know what she does all day...  And you don't know your wife's blood type
Sure you all are married
Where are her folks
New York
Yeah
Can they get here time for this press conference tomorrow
I have no idea
I haven't talked to them
You haven't called your wife's parents yet
You can't get a signal in this building
I've been in here talking to you
Now
Fine
Should I know my wife's blood type
I apologize, marybeth
I didn't know what was going on
Now I'm at the station...  And the cops are at the house, and it's serious and I'm calling you
There's a lot of things that are being juggled right now
I'm standing right next to detective Rhonda boney...  Who's the lead investigator on this and she's...  My motherinlaw would like to speak with you
This is detective boney
I wanna go home
I don't wanna be here
I wanna go home
Dad
What's going on
Really
You're Nick dunne
We've been trying to get a hold of you all afternoon
My wife is missing
Bitch
Your father wandered out of comfort hill after lunch
We found him walking route 79, disoriented
We've been trying to call you for the last..
I don't get a cell signal in this building
Sir, please don't take that tone with me
Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch
Dad, stop
I think that would be wise
Thanks
This voice mailbox is currently full
Fuck
Get your fucking hands off me
Thanks
Everyone told us and told us and told us..
And compromise and more work
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter.
"When young Amy's hope did wane...  "She wandered here..."  Well, it's not true
Not for me and Nick
"...In search of Jane.
It's just good
Austen
You were an alienated teen and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you
Look at that
You naughty minx
Well, technically, we are supposed to fuck at the next stop
Yeah, in keeping with tradition
God bless Jane Austen
I'm enthusiastic
Look at that
It's confirmed by the..
Year two
We had that joke that our sex was too good for ordinary
So, these are 2,000 threadcount...  we're so cute
I wanna punch us in the face
That's pretty great
I mean, that is pretty great
I don't need a lawyer
Here, I'll do this
Well, did they ask personal stuff about Amy
What did you say
I said she was complicated
Nick
Everyone knows "complicated" is code for "bitch.
God
I feel sick
Thanks
It seems like the kind of thing that would happen to Amy
She always attracts...  drama
You can say it
It's just me and you
Doesn't mean I don't care about her
Detective
Excuse me
I'm noelle hawthorne
I'm Amy's best friend
Well, great
Where do you live, noelle
1032
Wonderful
I would love to talk to you
Can I come by in half an hour
I'm sorry
I got guys on the clock in here
But you give me 30 minutes
But that's usually bath time
Well, we'll talk in between shampoos
So, what do you got
It was definitely blood spatter you saw in the kitchen
Not that weird, but that is awfully high
So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep
Well, okay
Interesting
House is rented in her name
Car's in her name
Credit cards, utilities, phone bill, all in her name
Even his bar's in her name
No
But it is humiliating
What you got
It's with her unmentionables
Well, we have our first clue
I have to take a shower
No, don't
You wanna look like you've been up all night
Hey, be careful today, okay
That's a weird thing to say
Well, when you're upset, you bottle up
Or else you swing into your momma'sboy charm offensive and that can feel glib
Perfect
Okay
Just be..
Myself
Buy your tickets at the wing hut or local tristate tire stores
Your inlaws made it
Hi, rand
Hey, man
I'm detective boney
Margo
We played tennis yesterday, Nick
I just can't get over it
I knew you never should have moved back here
We didn't have a lot of choice
We are all worried
We are all scared
But we are all here now
And we will find Amy, together
Good
As you know, my wife, Amy elliott dunne..
Disappeared from our home on the morning of July 5th..
Louder
If anyone out there has any information..
Thank you
I'm rand elliott
My wife, marybeth elliott
Should I have said my name
Amy is our only child
She's kind
She really is amazing Amy
You know, there are millions of people out there...  Who grew up with her and care about her
We care about her, we love her
And we just want her back
Amy is a decorated scholar
She returned here to her husband's hometown...  And she made a life in her adopted home
Now, Amy needs your help
We're establishing a volunteer headquarters at the drury lodge
And our website is www.Findamazingamy.Com
Mr. dunne
Mr. elliott
Mr. dunne, any signs of foul play
Smile
That's all for now
Thank you
Amy is the kind of girl who attracts admirers
Yeah, definitely
And we've had instances...   Where things got..
Scary
Yeah, I know all about desi collings
He was obsessed
He attempted suicide after Amy broke up with him sophomore year
We had to file a restraining order
This would be high school
But he recently moved to St. Louis
That's just two hours away
To be fair, he is from St. Louis
We also have Tommy O'Hara
She broke up with him, he got very physical
She filed charges
Sexual assault, threat, battery, what
I only know it was bad
I didn't know this
Okay
Thank you
Anything more recent
Not that I know of
You got a minute
Imagine our confusion
A missing persons case...  And in your wife's dressing room, we find an envelope marked "clue.
That's for our anniversary
My wife does these treasure hunts
I'm hoping you can tell me what this means
You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt
It'll help me track Amy's movements before she disappeared
Of course
"Although this spot couldn't be tighter...  "It's a cozy room for my favorite writer.
I know this one
Although this spot couldn't be any tighter..
It's a cozy room for my favorite writer
Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two
Well, well
What does it say
Clue two
"You'll be the spy, and I'll be his lover
"Let's head on over...  "To the little brown house
These yours
No
But you read the first clue
Randy Professor, naughty student
Me and my ex just swapped cards
Where's this little brown house
I have no idea
Hello
Nicholas dunne
My wife's first pet
Is this necessary
It's... it's..
It's "puddles," right
Or is it "poodles?
Hello, stranger
Fancy meeting you here
It's your dad's house, right
Are you following me
Like you said, it's my dad's house
I come by once a week, make sure the place hasn't burned down
But it looks okay
I'll walk you out
You know..
From the clue
Nope
Still blue
Picture me, I'm a girl who's very, very bad
I need to be punished, and by "punished," I mean "had.
It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five
Bitch
Add one recession...  Subtract two jobs
It's surprisingly effective
Promise me we'll never be like them
Like who
All those awful couples we know
Husbands who treat their wives like the highway patrol...  To be outfoxed and avoided
I think I'm gonna be laid off
We're in a recession
If it happens, we'll deal with it
I'll probably be next
We have each other
You are exceptional
My turn
That's terrible
And they need to borrow from my trust fund
How much
Almost a million
This is where you say, "everything else is background noise.
Amy, if you're laid off...  And I'm laid off..
I said I'd do it
Without talking to me
Well, it's..
Your call
Their money, technically
You're right
Everything else is just background noise
Hey
Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks
Laptoping
I see
You can give your parents $879,000 without talking to me..
But God forbid I buy a video game without getting your permission
You don't trust me
You don't trust my judgment
You certainly don't trust my intention
What are you talking about
That's the basic tenet of a prenup, isn't it
Why are you throwing that in my face again
Because it's easy to throw
Nick, I don't get it
The nagging shrew
The controlling bitch
I'm your wife
I'm sorry
I just don't know how to do this
I've never not had a job
You'll get another job
Hi, go
What
Hold on
What
And suddenly..
Okay, tell me what's wrong
Bless you, Nick
Father
Hey, tom
Nick, good to see you
Good to see you
Hey, guys, hey
Jodie
Oh, we'll find her
You look like hammered shit
Thank you
You ever see that guy in the glasses before
Don't worry
I mean, you tend to get a lot of...  Dogooders
Freaks
Hey, I meant to ask you
Noelle hawthorne
She lives on your street
Amy's best friend
I've never heard the name noelle hawthorne
Oh
Yeah, we might say hi to them on the street
But "best friend"
No
He acted like noelle was a complete stranger
Of course he did
Oh, look
He's being a good guy..
You really don't like him, do you
What's to like
This mailbox is currently full
Press one to...  Nick
I just wanted to introduce myself
I am so sorry for your troubles
Thank you
That's kind
Are you remembering to eat
I'm gonna fix you up my worldfamous chicken frito pie
That's very kind and very unnecessary
You have to keep your strength
Would you...  Say, "chicken frito pie!
You know what
It's a nice photo
I know it is
Will you
Would you go ahead and please delete that picture
You just press...  What is wrong with you
Could you please not share that with anyone
I will share it with whomever I please
Dude
Marybeth is pissed
Why
Marybeth
It's like you're the goddamn homecoming king
It was important to my mother that I be polite..
It looked like you were having fun
I am in a nightmare
All I'm trying to do is be nice...  To the people who are volunteering to help find Amy
You're right
My God, this place literally smells like feces
In your searches, did you find any golf clubs, real fancy
No
How about a brand new stratocaster
Well, all right
How big's that TV
It's not 65inch
Okay
Kibble
Excuse me
He asked me to feed his cat
I saw some in the pantry
Detective boney, officer gilpin
I know y'all are in there
Detective boney
Just remind her it is a possible crime scene
Look at that pieeating grin, from a guy whose wife is missing
How are you doing
Terrific
How's marybeth
And you
Awesome
Hey...  Have you told me everything
Of course
Why would you even ask me that
Ever since you walked into the bar that morning Amy went missing, you seem...   Off
I am off
Everybody's examining me and projecting their shit on me
Can we do that
Of course
You know what I keep thinking
If mom were here
Like I'm 12
Nick, mom would fix it
I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep
Love you
Love you
I am a missourian
Bye, dad
No money, no jobs, no prospects
Mama Maureen..
Stage 4 breast cancer
So, we moved to Missouri
I just wish he'd asked
Nick is happy to be home
But I don't know if he's happy I'm with him
I feel like something he loaded by mistake
Something to be jettisoned, if necessary
I feel like I could disappear
Oh, my God
I saw you on TV
It's so crazy
Yeah, I know
She just vanished
She's just gone
I've been so worried about you
I called you a hundred times
You gotta pick up your phone
Rehearsals
Godspell
My sister's asleep in the other room
I needed to see you
I know this is a bad idea
Can you at least tell me you love me
I've been so scared
Between rehearsals
I know
We need to stop
I need you
Touch me
Stop it
Come here
Okay
Did you, by any chance, tell anybody anything about us
Facebook
I use the disposable phone
You buy my presents in cash
I know, sweetie
Did you leave a pair of red panties in my office
I don't know
Maybe
They better be mine
Sweetheart, think
I'd have to check my red panty inventory
Andie, I need you to take this seriously, okay
Until it's safe
You were going to get a divorce
Never say that out loud again
Okay
I don't wanna fight
I just wanna be with you
Andie, please...  That's all I want
I can't
It's our last time together
Let's make the most of it
My husband has come undone
We moved to Missouri to save Maureen..
It means a lot that you came
We took a hit on the brownstone...  And I used the last of my trust fund to buy him a bar
So far, it's just costing money
Nick uses me for sex when he wants
Otherwise, I don't exist
We should go to outback tonight
That would be nice
I became someone I don't even like
The kind of woman I used to mock
You're out so much
Stay home
I can't, I'm already late
Then, can I come
You would hate it
Do our code
No bullshit
I thought we weren't gonna be that couple
Okay, bye
Hey, I've been thinking
Something positive
Maybe it's time
Now is literally the worst time
It would be a new start for us
And for me, I would have a real purpose here
Not a hobby
An inspiration
We could have had this fight four hours ago
I'm late
You really wanna be the couple that has a baby to save their marriage
"Save"
Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever
Yeah
You're a fucking coward
No, it can't go on like this
Really
I won't
You won't
Why, it's not good enough for you
It's not even close
You stupid bitch
What scared me was how much he wanted to hurt me more
What scared me was that I'd finally realized..
I am frightened of my own husband
Nah, I'll protect you
Jesus
Seems like folks are trying
You really think this is anything
Cross it off the list
Hey, Jason
What's up, Rhonda
"...and dedicated to the proposition that all men..."   Have you seen this girl around here
She was reported missing
"...and so dedicated, can long endure.
Yeah
I remember her
What did she want
She wanted a gun
I told her it's not my thing
I felt bad, though
She seemed really desperate
You don't forget a girl like that in here
She was all in pink
It was Valentine's day
For Valentine's day, I thought I'd buy a gun
That is how crazy I've become
Nick wants me gone but he won't ask for a divorce
The bitch with the prenup
I could go home to my parents..
But I'd have to tell them the truth
And I don't even know if I believe the truth
I'm being paranoid
Crazy
It's just..
I'd sleep better with a gun
Oh, shit
My sister's gonna come out here
Sorry to rush you
It's okay
Here
Let me help you
Just get that
Be very careful
I'm all right
Here you go
Okay, we will
Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy
Don't go crazy
Okay
You fucking asshole
You fucking lied to my fucking face
I'm sorry
How old is she
How long
A year and a half
If I told you, you would have made me stop
It's so fucking small
You're a liar and a cheat
You're just like dad
How did you even meet her
I thought writers hated clichés
I'm not a writer
"Boohoo, I got laid off
It wasn't like that, okay
You have no idea how shitty it was with Amy...  How fucking terrible she made me feel
I would get knots in my stomach...  Just coming home, knowing she would be sitting there..
Dissatisfied, before I even walked in the fucking door
This is so bad
If anybody finds out, you're totally fucked
Boney found a pair of panties in my office...  Where, occasionally, Andie and I..
Are they supertwat's
Her name is Andie
She's not entirely sure
So we are dealing with a 20yearold...  Who isn't sure where she leaves her undies
If they're not Andie's, that means that they're Amy's...  And she left them there for me to find
Nick, I was scared for you before, and now, I'm fucking petrified
We're having a vigil tonight for your missing wife...  And this morning, you're kissing your college girlfriend goodbye
Have you watched television lately
I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep
His wife's nowhere to be found...  And here's Nick dunne for you, flirting
Cute pic, huh
Who is that
Some fucking tragedy groupie
I don't know
She was trying to give me a casserole
On the show today we have defense attorney, Tanner bolt...  Patron Saint to wifekillers everywhere
Tanner bolt, would you actually consider defending Nick dunne
Well, let me just say...  As always, Ellen, thank you for such a warm welcome
But of course, I'd defend Nick dunne
Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath is a lack of empathy
But the truth is, you'd have to be a sociopath...  To behave normally in this situation...  Because it's the most abnormal situation in the world
I'm so sick of being picked apart by women
You need to hire Tanner bolt
I don't deserve this
Innocent until proven guilty
That's exactly what you deserve
Go home, Nick
I can't believe we haven't arrested this guy
We're not gonna arrest anybody...  Just because some blonde dunce says so
Why are you going so easy on him
You got a crush
And, two, don't talk to me that way, ever
We don't know who or what was scaring her, gil
Give me the update
No drug angles panned out yet, so cross that off the list
I talked to the nurses who care for Nick's father
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten, so cross that off the list
Hey
So, luminol lit up the kitchen like the 4th of July
Whoa
Yeah
The blood is profuse
It is Amy's, type b, and we should have DNA soon
Maybe a club or a twobyfour
She fell there, but I doubt she got back up
Amy's medical records come in
No, we'll have them later tonight
My wife says he's a killer
Hey
Thank you all for coming out
Hey Donnie, how are you
Hey
Thank you, folks
Thank you for being here tonight
It just means the world to our family
And to Amy
Disappeared three days ago
And I want to implore anyone who has any information at all..
Please come forward
Help us
So hot
He is so creepy
I had nothing to do with the disappearance of my wife
I haven't hired a lawyer
I have nothing to hide
Amy is my soul mate
She is brilliant...  She's charming, and wise
Asshole
I love my wife..
So much
And I may not behave for the cameras the way they want me to...  And if they wanna punish me for that, that's okay
But don't harass the people of this town
If you need to mock somebody, mock me
Nick
But please don't turn this investigation into a circus
Where's your wife, Nick
Let the police do their jobs
Did you tell them that, Nick
Did you tell them Amy was six weeks pregnant
Thank you for your support tonight
Let's find Amy
Go ahead, if you guys wanna say something
Nick, where are you going
No questions right now
Thank you
Why are you running away
Don't run
Everybody, stay back
Guys, come on
You know better
Get off the grass, get down to the curb
All right
All right, y'all heard her
No pictures
Hello
Fuck
You scared me
Want a drink
I told you, noelle hawthorne is fucking crazy
They look like pretty good friends to me
Look, I don't know
But it certainly doesn't prove that she's pregnant
We have her medical records coming
Good
So, let's talk while we wait
The scene of the crime
You see, we've seen dozens of home invasions
Dozens and dozens
This area right here, it looked wrong from the second we saw it
The whole thing looked staged
And yet, they remained upright throughout this lifeanddeath struggle
I don't know
What do you want me to say
Did you do any housekeeping the day your wife went missing
No
And I'm sorry to tell you, but that kitchen lit up
Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick
Oh, my God
Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up
Wait a second
If they're trying to stage a crime scene
No blood and no body suggests kidnapping
It tells us, look at people outside the house
A pool of blood and no body suggests homicide
It tells us to look at people inside the house
Which is what we're doing here, Nick
I see
Because right now, all we got is noelle
She says, "not good.
Gil, what do you and your wife argue about
What pisses you off
Money, lack thereof
Me and my ex, it's the same
I mention that because we got a look at your finances, Nick
What
I pulled up some of the merchandise
There are these fun little splurges
I didn't buy any of this stuff
I do
You bought great clubs
I like the robot dog
This is a felony
We need to find out who did this
All right
Let's talk about life insurance
Because in April, you bumped up Amy's life insurance...  To $1.2 million
Yes, I did
You filed the paperwork
Because she told me to
Hold on a sec
Yeah
Okay
For sure
She was pregnant
This is insane
So, my question becomes..
Without a lawyer
Margo
Hey
Just hold on a second
Let me finish
Nick
I was as surprised as..
I know you're upset
I had no idea she was pregnant
Listen, I thought so, too, but evidently that wasn't...  you want to know the truth
Well, I'm as surprised as...  you told me you didn't want kids
I was trying to put a good face on
Then, suddenly, you've got a pregnant wife
Especially when you factor in the secret teenage girlfriend
Oh, stop watching Ellen abbott
You have to fucking talk to me
I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids because she didn't want me to
And we had enough of those already
It was easier to just...   lie to me
I wanted kids
When we first moved here, I went to a fertility clinic
It didn't work
I did my part
When it came time for Amy to do her thing, all of a sudden it was like...  "Well, I don't know
No, thanks.
Now, who would believe you
All right
This is a letter from the clinic...  Notifying me that they're gonna destroy my sample..
Unless I contact them
So, I gave it to Amy
But you were already with Andie by then, right
A year ago, Amy being pregnant would have been the best thing ever
"When your poor Amy has a cold, this dessert just..."  this is the clue you couldn't solve
Yeah
A letter from desi
It was the fucking rich guy who would do anything for her
It just kept hanging over my head
It was disgusting
Your prenup
Nick, why have you kept this stuff
It's like a little box of hate
Maybe I hate her
I love you no matter what
But you need to tell me
Tell you what
What are you asking me
Is that what you're asking me
If I murdered my wife
I would never ask you that
Don't walk on the glass
You have no clue, do you
Why was he here that night
His wife is missing
Why come here
Rhonda, we got this
Let's make the arrest
No
Well, it's incredibly hard
So, I want one last thing
What's that
I want a body
Picture me
I'm a girl who's very, very bad
I need to be punished, and by "punished," I mean "had.
It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five
So, open the door...  Punish
Wood
And look alive
Punish
Wood
Wood
That this child might really save our marriage
But I could be wrong
Because sometimes..
The way he looks at me..
I think...  Man of my dreams...  Father of my child..
He may truly..
Kill me
Wtf
I am so much happier now that I'm dead
Technically, "missing.
Gone
And my lazy, lying, cheating, oblivious husband...  Will go to prison for my murder
Nick dunne took my pride and my dignity...  And my hope and my money
He took and took from me until I no longer existed
That's murder
Let the punishment fit the crime
Harvest the details of her humdrum life
And cram her with stories about your husband's violent temper
Secretly create some money troubles
Credit cards, perhaps online gambling
With the help of the unwitting...  Bump up your life insurance
Purchase getaway car
Craigslist
Generic
Pay cash
You need to package yourself so that people will truly mourn your loss
As if it's so hard to spread your legs
You know what's hard
Faking a pregnancy
First, drain your toilet
Invite pregnant idiot into your home...  And ply her with lemonade
Steal pregnant idiot's urine
A pregnancy is now part of your legal medical record
Happy anniversary
Wait for your clueless husband...  To start his day
And the clock is ticking
Meticulously stage your crime scene...  With just enough mistakes to raise the specter of doubt
You need to bleed
A lot, a lot
A head wound kind of bleed
A crime scene kind of bleed
You need to clean poorly...  Like he would
Clean and bleed
Bleed and clean
And because you're you...  You don't stop there
You need a diary
Minimum, 300 entries on the Nick and Amy story
Start with the fairy tale early days
And they're crucial
You want Nick and Amy to be likeable
After that, you invent
The spending
The abuse
The fear
The threat of violence
And Nick thought he was the writer
Make sure the cops will find it
Finally, honor tradition with a very special treasure hunt
And after all the outrage, when I'm ready..
I'll go out on the water with a handful of pills...  And a pocket full of stones
And when they find my body, they'll know...  Nick dunne dumped his beloved like garbage
And she floated down past all the other..
Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women
Then, Nick will die, too
But, then, we never really existed
"Cool girl.
Men always use that as their defining compliment
"She's a cool girl.
Cool girl is hot
Cool girl is game
Cool girl is fun
She only smiles in a chagrined, loving manner...  And then presents her mouth for fucking
She likes what he likes
So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster who loves fetish manga
If he likes girls gone wild, she's a mall babe...  Who talks football and endures buffalo wings at Hooters
And for him, I'll admit, I was willing to try
I waxstripped my pussy raw
I drank canned beer watching Adam sandier movies
I blew him semiregularly
I lived in the moment
I was fucking game
I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it
Nick teased out of me things I didn't know existed
A lightness, a humor, an ease
Sharper
I inspired him to rise to my level
I forged the man of my dreams
We were happy pretending to be other people
And what's the point of being together if you're not the happiest
But Nick got lazy
He actually expected me to love him unconditionally
Then he dragged me, penniless, to the navel of this great country...  And found himself a newer, younger, bouncier..
You think I'd let him destroy me and end up happier than ever
No fucking way
He doesn't get to win
My cute, charming, saltoftheearth, Missouri guy
He needed to learn
Grownups work for things
Grownups pay
Wait
I need 20 seconds where you don't judge me, interrupt me...  Or get angry
Is that all the stuff from the credit cards
Where do you store goodies for anniversary five
Wood
Woodshed
Yeah, my woodshed
I thought..
It's all right
I would have, too
What's that present
I don't know
Let's find out
"Don't believe that for a second
"I know where you've been, and I know where you're going.
"For this anniversary, I've arranged a trip
"Follow the river, up, up, up
What's "up, up river"
"Up the river.
Fucking crazy bitch
That's what this is
She's framing me for her murder
You married a complete psychopath
The morning of our anniversary..
I was gonna ask her for a divorce
I couldn't fake it for another year, another day
Then what happened
Before I could say anything, she said...  "I need you to go somewhere and really think about our marriage.
She knew I would go to Sawyer beach
She stagemanaged me
And I fucking did it
I went to the beach, I thought about our marriage
I came back and decided I wanted a divorce
You fuck
She's good
Part of me was relieved..
When I thought she was gone
Remember, he beats Judy to death and kills that baby
So I'm punch
We already knew that, Amy, what's your point
Does Missouri have the death penalty
Hey, neighbor
It's been weeks since I had anyone decent next door
Well, I don't know how decent I feel
All right
Nice meeting you
I'm greta
I'm Nancy
Are you going to the marina
I'm sorry
I can't
I've got work to do
All right
You will
Come on
Show me that darling Nicky smile
You asshole
Nancy
Nancy
It's hot again today
So, where are you from
Nebraska
New Orleans
Oh, I just bet you are
Lotions and balms
Ointment
I would hate for y'all to get tan lines
Okay
You know where I'll be
I see we have the same taste in men
I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet
Let me guess
He's trying to watch the big game and you just won't shut up
No, you don't seem like much of a talker
I got it
Worse
Worse
I went to the bar where he works to surprise him
And out he comes with this girl who had no business being in a bar
On the very first night that we met...  We walked by a bakery that was having their sugar delivered
And it was in the air, everywhere
And before he kissed me..
He leaned in...  And did this
And guess what
He did the exact same thing with her
That is the most disgusting thing I ever heard
Thanks very much
Well, we've gone mainstream
It's an appeals process, so we will attempt to appeal to them
Mr. bolt
Tanner bolt
Nick dunne
I have been sitting by the phone, my friend
Do you not believe me
No, I believe you
It's just the craziest thing I've ever heard
I love it
But you gotta have a grudging respect for your wife at this point, right
Are you laughing me out of the building
No
I'm in
I'm way in
You came to the right guy
This is what I do, Nick
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer
$100,000
We'll figure something out
I'll give you a special...  "My wife is skilled in the art of vengeance" rate
Okay
Well, right now, it's a "he said, she said.
No, Nick
She is telling the perfect story
So, we need to start today to prepare your defense, should we need it
And if we decide to go with your version of...  the truth
Then we'll need to realign the public's perception of Amy
Now, that is a huge realignment
We'll need other voices besides yours
There has to be someone out there that she's screwed with in the past
There's a New York guy
Eight years ago, she pressed charges against him
That should be easy to find
Exclassmate, desi collings
She said that he stalked her
He's in St. Louis
You go talk to Tommy, and I'll draw up the contract
Apparently
Tommy
Thanks for seeing me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're gonna want a drink
Yeah
No, dude, she said I raped her
First degree, felony rape
Did you do it
Did you do it
Did you get a trial
Fuck, no
I pled down, man
Sexual assault one, no jail time
That's something
Oh, yeah
I'm on a neighborhood watch list, because I have to register as a predator
I haven't had a date in almost a decade, because if a girl googles me...  Could you walk me through what happened
I meet Amy at this party, you know
We click
She's perfect
I think, "what's the catch?
A few months, it hits me
This is not going to be easy
Girls like a fixerupper, but Amy
She made me her business
It was just too much
She went out and bought me ties
Ties
The whole thing just became...   so, you broke up with her
No, I just backed away
Gave her some space
No big deal, right
So I thought
And within two minutes, she's got my pants around my ankles...  And she is kneeling down, and..
I'm sorry
You had sex
Yeah, consensual
It was rough, but she was screaming for it
Next morning, there's two cops at my door
Amy has wounds that are consistent with rape
Ligature marks on her wrist, and my semen
It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed, and raped her
And then, guess what they find
Headboards of my bed, one on each side
The ties you wouldn't wear
Did you ever see her again
Yeah
On TV, last week, with you
I thought, "there's Amy
"She's graduated from being raped to being murdered.
You been watching this, too
We just found out...  Amy elliott dunne was, indeed, pregnant when she went missing
Kelly capitono, this makes me wanna throw up
What is it about a pregnant woman, a woman carrying life inside her...  That turns men into animals
Ellen, this is an epidemic
Let's not forget about the wife, ever
Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend, noelle hawthorne
Thanks for being on the show, noelle
And let me just say this...  Amy would have loved you, and all you do for women
Oh, that's nice
Why don't you tell us about your friend, noelle
Oh, I'd love if just once, someone was like...  "She was a real rag.
She was beautiful and smart and kind
Seems like a rich bitch to me
What do you mean
I don't know
She seems uppity
Spoiled rich girl, married a cheating asshole
Paid the ultimate price
The only secret was her husband
He never introduced himself
Why do you think
I think we know why
Because he had a violent temper
A little harsh
That's life, baby
He knew I'd have seen right through him
Don't get me wrong
I'm just saying, there are consequences
Fuck, yeah
And she was so innocent
You're a good friend, noelle
And you're a good friend of the show
Thanks for coming on
Please tell me you landed Tanner bolt
Tanner bolt landed me
I'm gonna try and see desi collings on my way home
That's just the retainer
Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings
I'm approved for a second mortgage on the house
We will go from there
Thank you
I love you, too
Nick keeps his father, who has Alzheimer's, in a facility
Number of times he visited last year
One
Oh, fuck
His twin sister, margo, well, she is a peach
Playing what, Lauren
Playing house
What the fuck
Twin siblings often enable and abet
While I never examined Nick, or his sister..
Disturbingly close, Lauren
And so, we close with a question
What kind of moral rot..
Allows a beautiful, talented, kind, smart, loving mother...  To vanish without the heavens hearing our outraged cries
Can I bum a cigarette
Amy elliott dunne, we care about you, and we will not forget
And you know what else we won't forget
Missouri has the death penalty
I'd like to report some strange activity...  Near the woodshed on the property of one margo dunne
Hey
Mr. collings
I know you
I saw you at the volunteer center
I wanted to help
I hope you don't mind me coming by
Amy and I believe in the lost art of letterwriting
I always wondered why you kept in touch after...  Everything
You were together for two years in boarding school, right
She was my first serious girlfriend
Why did you break up
Did you cheat on her
That's a rude question
Let me tell you what Amy told me
She dumped you, you completely unraveled
Your wife is missing, and you came all this way to tell me this
I thought there might be another side to this story
Mr. collings
Fuck
The missing persons case of Amy elliott dunne
She is the beautiful blonde inspiration for the amazing Amy kids' book series
You're reading that diary again
It interests me
Hey, Rhonda
"He's gonna kill me.
Why did he go to his dad's house to burn it
It's private
There's no one there
Because he tripped the alarm
You were up his ass with a flashlight
The whole thing just feels hinky
Like finding an envelope marked "clue.
You ever hear the expression...  "The simplest answer is often the correct one"
Actually, I've never found that to be true
Good night
Elvis is in Missouri
Thank God
Come on in
First thing you have to understand about Amy, she loves to teach lessons
Play God
Yeah, old testament God
Okay
Keep talking
Decides to teach me a lesson
Blood in the house, credit cards, life insurance
She does the treasure hunt
Now, the treasure hunt is critical
She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities
And she leaves clue number one for the police..
Which will lead them back to my office..
Which is a place where Andie and I would often...  And she leaves a pair of red panties
Right
Racy, looks bad
Clue two
Another place where Andie and I would occasionally have relations
Clue three
Woodshed
Also a location...  Oh, my God
We had limited options
Put it on Andie's credit card
Andie's statement went right to her parents
Nick, margo, can we head over to the little brown house
This leads us to what
Dad's house is blue
After the divorce, when dad wasn't coming around..
I used to pretend that he was a spy named Mr. brown, who...  For the sake of his children's safety, had to deny their existence
You never told me that
We've got incriminating red panties in your office
We've got a showcase showdown worth of crap in your woodshed
So, what in God's name is at your father's house, Nick
And be honest
I honestly have no idea
We got a lot of uncontained issues here
Nick, do you have any idea as to what Andie's mindset is
We haven't communicated since the vigil
Okay
Amy's parents
No, it's...  More pressure
No, Andie won't do that
She will
Don't take it personally
Amy's got us in an interesting bind
We need to tell the cops about Andie
Really
Right now, Andie just gives you another motive
We need to be on the front end of that
But I'm gonna warn you as to what will happen
They'll go after margo
She's your accomplice
She helped you hide the evidence
In all likelihood, she knows that you killed Amy
God
Well, what are we going to do
No
Any other strategy is missing the point
I've got two exsecret service guys that are really good
I'll put them on it
But where do they start, Nick
Where would Amy go
Are we keeping score
I thought we were steering clear of men for a while
He's nice
Because he wants to fuck you
She's still moping about her ex
He got cheated on, too
I'm not sad
I'm angry
There you go
I almost drank myself to death when my wife left me
Can you believe that
Don't give him the pleasure
I was going to drown myself in the Gulf of Mexico...  Let myself be dinner for the great whites
Gulf is bull sharks, miss nawlins
Why should I die
Please put that on a tshirt
Miss moneybags
I thought you said you were broke
That's a fat wad
It's mostly singles
What are you, a stripper
Swamp girls, or treasure chest
Don't they tease people down in nola
We can expect Nick dunne's arrest any day now
We've got blood in the house, huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy
Crying out for justice
We'll be right back
Tanner has a very bad idea he's going to pitch you
Yeah
It could go so wrong
And you are going to tell her about Andie
Nope
That sounds like a very bad idea
You haven't heard from her in three days
This is a ticking time bomb
People are gonna hate me
And then, they will forgive you
A guy admitting that he's a gigantic asshole on television
People empathize with that
They need to see you
Sharon's specials, they get 10 million viewers
She is a crusader
If she takes you on as a cause...  she's going to ask real questions
What to say, what not to say
A trained monkey
A trained monkey who doesn't get the lethal injection
Nick, this case is about what people think of you
Now, you do this and you will reach millions of those people
Maybe I only need to reach one
Hello
One minute
Hey
Hey
No, I'm just cleaning up
Let us come in and say goodbye
I'll come by before...  let us give you a hand
Yeah, you gotta clear everything out, here
Dorothy is a real stickler
Not even a spare hanger can you leave behind
Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside
You did a real good job
Where is the money, sweetheart
Look under her dress
He talked you into this
The second you leave, I'm calling the cops
Your hair's dyed all hamster
You say your name's Nancy, but you don't even answer to it half the time
You're hiding
I don't know why, and I don't really care
But you ain't gonna call the cops
And I don't think you've ever really been hit before
Sorry, but we really need the money
Next place, be more careful, okay
Excuse me
You can't sleep here
I did not kill my wife
Why don't you try it again
I didn't kill my wife
What are you doing
Every time you look smug...  Or annoyed or tense, I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear
That's supposed to make me less tense
Let's try it again
Yeah, we had some tough years
I lost my job
You both did
We both lost our jobs
Let's talk about your mom, how close you were
Go on
"Built up" implies that an explosion is coming
No
At a certain point, we got on the wrong track
I had a moment of weakness
I disrespected my wife
And I disrespected my marriage
And I'll always regret it
That works
Don't be afraid to play up the dufus husband thing, Nick
"I was an idiot
I'm a fuckup
"Everything I do is wrong.
What men are supposed to do in general
How do you feel
I feel good
Go, can you pass me that box, please
It's Amy's 33rd birthday present to me
You hate that watch
No, go
Just like I love this tie
Just like I love my wife
It's you
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Good God
Last week..
I threatened to leave, and he said he'd find me and he'd kill me
So, I disappeared
I couldn't even tell my parents
I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid
Well, he is looking for you
He tracked me from my letters to you
You saved them
Knowing you were out there...  Was the only thing that's kept me going these past few years
Let's go to the police
No, I can't turn up now
I'd be a pariah
Everyone would hate me
Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison
He should go to prison for what he's done
It's utterly secluded
Why are you so good to me
Excuse me
I know you, don't I
No
You're one of the nolan girls, right
Excuse us
We should leave
Just a second
That was boney
I'll call her later
Nice to see you
Sharon
Hi
You're gonna be very happy
Sharon
Ms. schieber
Can I get you anything to drink or eat before we get started
No, I had some gummy bears
What the fuck
We have a major shocking development in the amazing Amy disappearance
We go live to that story now
Oh, my God
You little slut
I met Nicholas dunne..
When he was my creative writing teacher at mill valley
Why is she dressed like a babysitter
I am deeply ashamed...  Of having been romantically involved with a married man
The girl with the giant cumonme tits
Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite
I know that is no excuse
No, it is not
I do not, in my heart, believe Nick dunne would have killed for me
My prayers go out to everyone who loves Amy
We have loved Nick dunne like a son
That love ended today
Come on, you're staring at ghosts
He met our trust with lie after lie
We now absolutely believe...  Nick is involved in the disappearance of our daughter
Our amazing Amy
We're gonna have to bow out of this
Nothing has changed
Everything has changed
An hour ago, we were ahead of this
Now
We're on the defense
This is a completely different dynamic
I can handle it
She's going to eat you alive
Just trust me
Okay
Mic him
Thank you
He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist
Yeah, no kidding
Roll tape
Five... four...  Three... two..
Seriously, I can't believe how fucking good you were
Amy brings out the best in me
Keep it together, you two
At least for the next 24 hours
People still hate you
Women want to scratch your eyes out
Andie was really good TV
Therein lies the problem
Ride this out...  And when Sharon airs tomorrow, we'll be looking at a whole new you
No problem
Welcome
I've got music, satellite...  Netflix
He was her teacher
Roku
Internet, obviously
Here is a supposedly grown man...  if there is ever anything you have a taste for and you can't find it...  Just let me know and I will get it for you
Instead of the abc's, he taught her the birds and the bees
Wine cellar's downstairs
I'll get you some clothes, too
Not that I don't appreciate bait shop chic
The floors are heated, just dial to your liking
The shower has steam
The bathtub has a massage cycle
Blackout curtains if you're not
The bed is savoir
You'll never get a better sleep
This is just what I need
I'm so exhausted
I'll leave you to it, then
And I don't want you to worry for one moment
There are cameras everywhere
Anyone...  Who is caught coming or going...  Will be recorded
You are more than safe
And I am not letting you get away again
Good morning
I'm sorry
I need to feel safe
You are very safe
What have you been up to
Nothing
Amy, I'm not Nick
It's hard for me
I know just what that feels like
You were never under my thumb
On your leash
Never
Decent clothes
Hair dye
Makeup
Tweezers
There's a gym overlooking the lake
I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch Sharon schieber, and finally move on
I think that's something I should watch on my own
Nonsense
And I am looking forward...  To my reunion with Amy elliott
Great
Good evening, I'm Sharon schieber
Tonight, exclusively..
Hurry up
But on his infidelity, and all those shocking rumors
Nick dunne...  You're probably the most hated man in America right now
I probably am
I bought that tie
Did you kill your wife, Nick
I did not kill my wife
I am not a murderer
I was unfaithful
And I am deeply ashamed
And, on top of that, you allowed Amy's parents..
Her friends, all the people in your hometown..
Believe you were a loving husband, desperate to find his missing wife
You say that, but I'm wondering how you expect us to believe you...  Now that we know you're a liar
But I don't care about that anymore
I just want to find my wife
I'm just trying to get clear...  Let me be clear
Just because I am not a murderer doesn't make me a good guy
I was a bad husband to a great wife
I broke the vow that I made to her
Those are pretty words, Nick
But what does that really mean to you
It basically means that I was a con artist
I met Amy elliott seven years ago
I was completely transfixed
And I met a woman who dazzled me
And I wanted her to love me..
So I pretended to be better than I was
When we got married, I promised to be that guy
That guy who works harder
That guy who, who lives and acts...  And loves with as much passion as she does
But I failed her
I did what was easy
You talk like a man who believes he can make amends to his wife
Who believes his wife is still alive
She is still alive
Will you look in the lens...  And talk to your wife
If she is out there, able to hear and see you tonight...  What would you like to say to her, Nick
Amy, I love you
And I've taken myself to the woodshed for the way that I've treated you
And if you come back, I promise..
I will spend every day making it up to you
I will be the man that I promised you I would be
I love you
Come home
Regardless of what you thought...  What does it say
I think we can all agree...  Oh, my God
There's more to him than meets the eye
They're going crazy for you
And now they love me
A candor and an honesty that's worthy of respect
He's certainly earned mine
What is it
I'm Sharon schieber
Good night
I usually ignore tipline calls..
But a neighbor was concerned about a strange man around your woodshed
Okay
Fuck
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick
Is that what this is about
I have treated you more than fair throughout this entire investigation
I gave you the benefit of the doubt over and over
Every time you said something stupid..
But I was wrong
That's what this is about
Are these the clubs you don't play golf with
None of that is mine
Those are nice clubs
You got the makings of a real man cave
Everything just waiting until the wife goes away for good
Nick
You can't do that
What can I do to help
I need some time to think
That's the last thing you need
Desi...  twenty years, you have kept me dangling
Finally, last night, you came to me, and you chose me
Don't trust the instinct that left you beaten and homeless...  Sleeping in your car, fearing for your life
I'm not gonna force myself on you
I understand what you're saying, desi
I do
I've been so mistreated for so long
I'll move in here tomorrow...  And we'll work it out together
I just want you to be you again
They only took margo to fuck with you
She's not spending another fucking second in there
What
We tell boney very little
Without a body, without a murder weapon...  Their only hope is a confession
So, you let them do all the talking
That way, we can jumpstart your defense
Recognize these
Yes
Was that how she told you she was pregnant, Nick
Mommy, daddy, baby, and that made you real mad
No
Recognize this
Never seen that before in my life
We found this at your father's house
Is this your wife's handwriting
Our experts thought so, too
Do you wanna play a little true or false
Sure
"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips so he can taste me.
Yeah, that's true
You thought quinoa was a fish
She wanted to get pregnant, you assaulted her
I hit her
No, never happened
Absolutely not
I never touched her
She tried to buy a gun
I doubt that, but I don't know
Shall I read the last entry
"This man may kill me.
In her own words, "this man may kill me.
It's kind of a convenient end note
For future reference..
The truth, you are not a handwriting expert
Okay, I know
Big as a twobyfour, right
Big as a club
We didn't know what the hell it was, but fire in July
We bagged it
I've never seen that before either
We just tested it
Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick
So, finally, Nicholas dunne...  You're under arrest for the murder of your wife
What about my side
Nick
I'd love it
Remember that time we skipped school and drove to the cape
Lobster right from the ocean
This reminds me of that
Neverending holiday
You're not bored
You can discuss 18thcentury symphonies...  19thcentury impressionists, quote proust in French
Nick's idea of culture was a reality TV marathon...  With one hand down his boxers
I really have to get going
But I will be back just as soon as I can
My keys
Thank you
Dunne
You got one hell of a lawyer
Hey
Are you okay
Yes
Are you
Let's go
What does this mean
You can relax at home while we prep for trial
Keep your head down
Tanner, is there any fucking lead on Amy
She's air
Come home, Amy
I dare you
Mr. collings is home
I've missed you
I've been thinking..
I don't wanna be without you
And when all this dies down, we'll go to Greece, like you said
Octopus and scrabble
How long do you think until it's done
Not long
Six months for the trial
Sentencing will be quick
He'll appeal
I can watch the rest overseas
But I want it
Don't rush
Harder
You fucking bitch
Don't you worry, you're gonna have lots of babies
Her wounds are consistent with rape
There was semen present
Yeah, it'll match
Thank you very much
What do you think
Are we pals again
What do you think
The story's insane
She's on fairly heavy painkillers
It's okay
I want to help
Ms. dunne, I know what you've been through..
So we'll keep this very brief
That morning, the doorbell rang
So normal
I opened the door
Since high school, he won't ever go away
And I've just tried to be nice to him
Answer his letters
Keep him calm
Oh, my God
You can't blame yourself
He pushed inside
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen
And he clubbed me
I collapsed
That club was actually the handle to a punch and Judy puppet
Right
Treasure hunt
I'd hidden some puppets at go's...  then how did desi have that handle
It must have fallen off
I was holding it when desi pushed in
So, he got it from me
About that woodshed..
Tied me to his bed
Back to the woodshed real quick
Real quick
Corresponding to purchases made on credit cards in your husband's name
Nick and credit cards
He buys, I nag
I don't know, probably
They're very close
Now, may I go back to where I was being held prisoner...  By a man with a history of mental problems
Please continue, Ms. dunne
Desi assaulted me that night
Every night
And then, he'd punish me
Starve me
Shave me
Sodomize me
There were cameras everywhere
Please find the tapes
She slit his throat with a box cutter
How did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter..
Can't you just be happy your wife is home and safe
Amy, we found your diary
It contains many concerning allegations of mental and physical abuse
Well, it's the ugly truth
He has a temper
