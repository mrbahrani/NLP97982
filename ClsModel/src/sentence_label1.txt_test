I gotta take the world's biggest fucking piss
Who's holding
You're getting angry kind of quick don't you think
I'm not having a tantrum
Yes you are
All right
Arlene have you forgotten what hanging out with Jungle Julia's like
Did you call Rafael and tell him we're coming
Okay is Christian Simonson gonna be there
He's gonna be there with Jesse Letterman
Those other guys will be waiting for us to join them at the Texas Chili Parlor
Okay we're pretty clear on what it is you didn't do
I said we made out
They call it "the thing"
They like it better than no thing
Were you making out sitting up or lying down
Who was on top
And I said "Yep right now
Let's go.
He said "How can you say you know what I'm gonna say?
I mean he's cute and all  but Jesse Letterman's gonna be all over her
Remember no hooking up tonight
But you know when he's got a bunch of halfnaked poontang  walking the floor of his lake house  he just likes to pay us a visit and make sure we got everything we need
That's his name
Fuck that
Best idea you had all day
Okay
Hey this is... and I's U.T
Hey
So you must be the infamous Butterfly
What the fuck is going on
Julia what the fuck did you say about me on the radio
Sure
Thank you
Yes it is
Barry
Oh you did did you
Don't you think she's got a big ass
Well that's what she always says but natural fact  she doesn't really have a black girl's ass
I don't wear their teeth marks on my butt for nothing
I'd love one
So after they buy you a drink  when they raise their glass to toast  they look you dead in the eye  and repeat this poem:  "The woods are lovely dark and deep  "and I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep
And then if they say that...  you gotta give them a lap dance
And I don't think you want everybody in Austin thinking you're a chickenshit
It's gonna be funny
No harm no foul but you get a free drink out of it
Thank you
Lanna Frank
We're waiting for you
"Shawna"

Good boy

You just tell us
He was real lucky
Well son number one  what I think is so goddamn ghoulish  I hesitate to speak it out loud
That old boy in there murdered them pretty little gals
The DA says ain't no crime here
Yeah but Pop he got pretty banged up hisself
Why
Probably the only way that diabolical degenerate can shoot his goo
But I got me a goddamn bartender gonna testify  that old Stuntman Mike didn't drink a drop all night  and his passenger was left stranded by her date  in the goddamn rain no less and she asked him for the fucking ride
Dog that rotten son of a bitch
And just because I can't punish old... Frankenstein in there for what he's done  I'm gonna tell you like the Lord told John
No he's on the 4th and I'm on the 7th
So how's The Rock as a kisser

Oh Toolbox

Lee is sitting on the toilet and Toolbox is watching her pee
Oh yeah
Mmmm
About three months
He totally had a girlfriend
So what's your story Abernathy
Bitch you two are still into each other and you know it
Hohoho
Your ass just mad
Thank you
Yeah I think he knew
He made you a tape
He didn't burn you a CD
I know what you're gonna say so don't even go there
It just sounds like there's a little more to it than that
Sorry
The reason Cecil hasn't had a girlfriend in six years is because girls will fuck him
Have you let him do anything
Let me get this straight
Fuck both of you and your little high five
So Zoë Kim and I are in the Philippines at an outdoor rave
What were you working on
It's dark as hell and you can't see shit
So we laugh about it and walk a little further  and Zoë starts fucking around  and damn if she doesn't fall in the fucking ditch
Yep
What happened
Zoë falls in the ditch and it's nothing
Yeah
Oh Kim I like you too
So Lee's right
I know this
When I became a Secret Service agent they gave me a license
Did you know Kim carried a gun
Yes
And you can't get around the fact that if I go down  to the laundry room in my building at midnight enough times  I might get my ass raped
There are other things you can carry other than a gun
Look if I ever become a famous actress  I won't carry a gun
It just so happens I know exactly what I wanna do
And I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger
How in the fuck do you expect to do that
So back home..
I repeat never... call a Kiwi an Aussie
I'm so sorry
Auckland to answer your question
So as of yesterday  for sale in this town  some dude is selling a stock 1970 Dodge Challenger  with a 440 engine and a white paint job
Oh uh Kowalski
What's Vanishing Point
Yeah well we're gearheads
Oh I like Pretty in Pink
Vanishing Point Dirty Mary Crazy Larry...  Mmhmm
It plays Vanishing Point Big Wednesday  all the classics
Right up here ladies
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself
If he lets us take it out on our own I wanna play ship's mast
Ain't no way I'm doing ship's mast
You said we ain't ever gonna do that again
Now did you or did you not say that
Yeah but when I said it I didn't mean in America
Oh nigga please
Right
You'll crack it anyway
But now while I'm here I'll be your backcracking slave
Deal
If he does you wait here with Lee and we'll be back in a moment
I just can't believe what you said
I'm still a little drunk and I have a hangover
He is never gonna go for it if we all go
What drive it fast
We ain't got good sense
But you got good sense  and anybody with good sense ain't gonna wanna do what we're doing
Besides he's probably not gonna let us do it anyway
But if I talk him into it I go along
That's good
You wanna hang with the cool kids  you got to be cool
I'm serious now
Go work your magic
Hello

Hello you poor devils
Big John
They was overseers at the Carrucan plantation
Like that
Everybody calm down
Now off with ya
You goddamn son of a bitch
Well...  And you killed Ace
Now if you could keep your caterwauling down to a minimum  I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django
So Mr. Speck
Django
Oh
Also Mr. Speck I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale
Whoa
Choice is yours
[clucking]  Now wait a minute fellas
I'm not a bad guy
Whoa
We won't be open for another hour
Innkeeper
Remember get the sheriff not the marshal
[chortles]  Despite that cart I haven't practiced dentistry in five years
After I've killed him I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities
It's like a reward
And they give you a reward
Which brings me to you
However at this endeavor  I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar as I don't know what they look like
I know what they look like all right
And when we find them you point them out and I kill them
Fun's over
These jokers will be gone soon
And scare all these nice people
Move that buckboard a long ways across the street from the saloon
Two men two rifles on that roof
I have the pleasure of addressing
I trust as a representative  of the criminal justice system of the United States of America  I shan't be shot down in the street by either you or your deputies  before I've had my day in court
Well much as we'd all enjoy seeing something like that  ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town
Here we come
My name is Dr. King Schultz
Now that's $200 dead or alive
Now this is a warrant made out by  Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas
I'll be damned
That's why we uh... we run off
I want you to burn a runaway "r" right here on his cheek
Separately
What
Yeah how you know
Your wife
When we gain access to these plantations we'll be putting on an act
During the act you can never break character
That's a fancy word for servant
Valet
This is my valet
Not around my niggers he can't
This is my valet Django
And it is for these attributes we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee  to parley with you now
Oh I'm afraid so
Well come on inside and get yourself somethin' cool to drink
Uh Betina
Oh Mr. Bennett I must remind you Django is a free man
He... within the bounds of good taste  he must be treated as an extension of myself
You got it
His mama work over at the lumberyard
Oh you mean Jerry
That house we just left from is The Big House
Didn't you hear him tell you I ain't no slave
Yes I's free
Their name is Brittle
John Brittle Ellis Brittle Roger Brittle sometime called Lil Raj
Maybe
Uhhuh
You could mess her skin up and you gonna mess her up  and she ain't gonna be worth... she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing
She's a... she's a house slave
Ain't this what you want
I like the way you beg boy
They whippin' Little Jody
Come on girlie
You'd better give me that arm
Goddamn son of a bitch
[grunting]    Y'all wanna see somethin'
I don't know
Yes
Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle
I am Dr. King Schultz a legal representative  of the criminal justice system of the United States of America
Now I reiterate the warrant states dead or alive  so when Mr. Freeman and myself executed these men on sight  we were operating within our legal boundaries
I realize passions are high  but I must warn you the penalty for taking deadly force  against an officer of the court in the performance of his duty  is you'll be hung by the neck until you're dead
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can and let's get outta here
[man 1] We're coming for you nigger
I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes
Who made this goddamn shit
Can you see
I just made mine worse
No nobody brought an extra bag
I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing
Now look let's not forget why we're here
Are the bags on or off
You get my vote Robert

So what
I can't see shit
What

Can't see shit outta this
Lots of gals where you're from named Broomhilda
Do you know it
Would you like me to tell you
It's a German legend  there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere
And there Broomhilda shall remain
He scales the mountain because he's not afraid of it
He slays the dragon because he's not afraid of him
Free or not it's just too dangerous
Yeah on that occasion you were a tad overzealous  but normally that's a good thing
How'd you like to partner up for the winter
Frankly..
Plus when a German meets a real life Siegfried that's kind of a big deal

He walks up to the farmer's farm and he knocks on the farmer's door  and asks the farmer to buy his horse
Not to mention the horse goes back to its original owner  because the horse is still his property
Well if we ain't gonna try to buy her then how we gonna get her
And makes an offer so ridiculous  the farmer is forced to say yes

You know you like it
And Eskimo Joe
Who knows
Hmhm
It's all right
Hm

But one must not forget the most important thing   in the nigger fight game
Hmmm
I see you two gettin' on
Monsieur Candie you a mess

Hildi top my drink off

If she's who they want...  ...why this whole snake oil pitch about Mandingos then
...out of New Orleans so I have quite a bit of practice with theater types
Lara Lee I was just looking out the big window
Hm
Hmmm
In a moment
Till he up and keeled over one day...  ...Old Ben took care of me
Now seeing them every day day in day out  I only had one question:   Why don't they kill us
Now...  ...if I was holding the skull of an Isaac Newton or Galileo  these three dimples would be found in the area of the skull  most associated with... creativity
And in the skull of Old Ben  unburdened by genius  these three dimples exist in the area of the skull most associated with...  ...servility
Now lay your palms flat on that tabletop
Where were we
I do believe you were just getting ready to make me  a proposition to buy Broomhilda
Dr. Schultz in Greenville  you yourself said that for the right nigger  you'd be willin' to pay what some may consider is a ridiculous amount
And I take it you prefer the "take it or leave it" style of negotiation
Easy big fella
Yes you may
Sold

Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.

Okay so Ted what do you think about that tasty beverage
Shut up

[Spoon Tapping Glass]  Excuse me if it please the court

You ever see the one called The Man From Rio with Peter Lorre and Steve McQueen

That's quite brilliant sir
You know if f ate doesn't smile on old Norman  we'll put that fucker on ice whisk it right to the hospital  where in all likelihood they'll be able to sew it right back on

His interests have been looked after
That's no problem

None whatsoever
Sit right down

Shh
[Group] Six hundred
About one minute less than it takes to count to 700
So Ted what's it gonna be
Whoo
Go
Norman are you ready
Ready
Oh
Call fuckin' Cedars
Why'd you let me do this
Nonsense Syllables]   Leo
I'll be right back
Oh fuck
[Elevator Bell Dings]  I f orgot the finger
Come on come on
Just put some fuckin' ice in it
No it's been fun
Nonsense Syllables]  Nonsense Syllables]  Nonsense Syllables]      While I'm very familiar with you and your family  I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am
Please tell me what you've heard
I've heard  that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France  who are either hiding or passing for Gentile
If you can assist me with answers  my department can close the file on your family
Herr Colonel would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe
Only rumors
So monsieur LaPadite  what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses
There were five of them
Continue
I'm not really sure
Monsieur LaPadite  are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me
What are you aware of
I understand your trepidation in repeating it
precisely a German soldier
If a rat were to scamper through your front door right now  would you greet it with hostility
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague but that's some time ago
Yet I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels  that you do with rats do you
If a rat were to walk in here right now as I'm talking  would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk
Consequently a German soldier conducts a search  of a house suspected of hiding Jews
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of  once they abandon dignity
That is unless you have something to tell me  that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary
You're sheltering enemies of the state are you not
You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards aren't you
I'm going to switch back to French now and I want you to follow my masquerade
ALDO: Tenhut
I don't know about you all  but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains  cross 5000 miles of water fight my way through half of Sicily  and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity
Now I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger
And they will find the evidence of our cruelty  in the disemboweled dismembered  and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us
Sound good
But I got a word of warning for all you wouldbe warriors
Or you will die trying
Go
You know what "sit down" means Werner
Because if need be we got a couple of fellows who can translate
As a Germanenlisted man he killed 13 Gestapo officers
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz
I think you show great talent
We all come here to see if you want to go pro
HIRSCHBERG: [ LAUGHING ] Oh yeah
You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger
And you need to tell me right now
You might know him better by his nickname
What did you hear
And Werner I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time  and if you still respectfully refuse  I'm calling The Bear Jew over
Donny
Got us a German here who wants to die for country
Donny
Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame
Get the fuck up
ALDO: Wicki
What kind of artillery
So tell them we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks  what's going to happen to every Nazi we find
WICKI: He's going to burn it
That way you can spot them
You know Lieutenant you're getting pretty good at that
MALE NARRATOR: At that time 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable  that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar
Go on hop off
Drink
Something for yourself sir
Like a Katzenjammer Kid
Impressive
Pabst
Well...  Down with Hitler
Obviously I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years  but I'm familiar with it
Goebbels considers the films he's making  to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema
You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game
Brief him
The objective of Operation Kino  blow up the basket
An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines  will be your assist
You'll be dropped into France about 24 kilometers outside of Paris
First thing you'll go to a little village called Nadine
How will I know her
star is working for England
Paris when it sizzles
Yeah in a basement
We wait
That's right sir
Should be uneventful
Loquacious type
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised the mission is kaput
Look she's not a military strategist
She was picking a place isolated and without Germans
And what would that be
American
What
l agree
We were in here drinking celebrating
What's your name soldier
ls the girl on your side
ls she okay
She's been shot
Aldo
And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy
We got us a deal
Okay okay
Hey Willi what's with the machine gun
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust
Up top they got grenades
Just take that fucking traitor and get her out of my sight
About I got three men dead back there
Before we get into who shot John  why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis
You remember him don't you
His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate
How'd he do that
The other looks odd
Tuxedos
The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant
I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon
However there's something you don't know
It probably has something to do with the second development
I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf  makes this horse a different color
Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam
That's German ain't it
I know this is a silly question before I ask it  but can you Americans speak any other language than English
Germans don't have a good ear for ltalian
It sounds like shit
Donowitz speaks second most so he'll be your Italian cameraman
He'll be Donny's assistant
Margheriti
Dominick Decocco
Fuck you too
Get off
My hands to be exact
Yeah
Do you know what happened to Donny
What is that English expression about shoes and feet
Finding people is my specialty  so naturally I worked for the Nazis finding people
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man
What do you mean the Little Man
Where's my men
Doublezero 23 and doublezero 24 if my memory serves
Explosives still around their ankles still ready to explode
If they're still here and if they're still alive and that's one big if  there ain't no way you're going to take them boys  without setting off them bombs
But you won't get Hitler you won't get Goebbels  you won't get Goring and you won't get Bormann
Wouldn't you agree
The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make
I'm betting for...  OSS would be my guess
You just say "Bingo.
Get me someone on the other end of that radio  with the power of the pen to authorize my  let's call it the terms of my conditional surrender
You know where I'm from...  Yeah
U p there if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity  but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family  selling moonshine liquor it behooves oneself to keep his wits
What shall the history books read
By the way that last part is actually true
In fact I want all the members of Operation Kino  to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor
l look forward to seeing you face to face as well sir
You will then take over driving of the truck  and bring them straight to me for debriefing
ls that clear Lieutenant
I have to
And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it
Utivich cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back
Are you mad
They need you
End the war tonight
I don't blame you
And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself

I'd say that if they try you and convict you you won't get more than a year and a day
They knew about the money
That would be... Beaumont Livingston

The legal advice and the ride
Come on in
Well?
Hey you got caught with blow

Just wait a minute
Let me finish
Ray I swear
Ordell probably told her to do it
I had to
What was I supposed to do if something happens?
There was nobody in the fitting room
I have no idea
I don't have an idea where the motherfuckin' money is
I'll do it
Fuck
found him shot in the car on Ninth
So what's gonna happen now?
What about me?
You've been helpin' us out

Fuck's wrong with you knockin' on the door like the goddamned police?
Got your money your bond refund?
You know what I mean
If she didn't there'd be cops batterramming your door down right now
Oh well bully for that nigger
Oh and I wanna hear that shit too
She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her  split the half million amongst themselves
All I did was walk out with it
She don't even know you’re here
My office
She doesn't wanna get shot before she can tell you what happened
She won't leave there till you get your money and you're gone
She believed you
That was my little blondehaired surfer girl
Uhhuh
I call over there she better answer the phone
Hold up home
Give me the keys
She gonna tell I me too
There ain't nothin' you wanna tell me before we get out of this car is there?
You got the key right?
Say Jackie

Does he have the marked bills on him
I found him
You guys didn't tell the police?
Mmhmm
Hey
Well you earned it
Hey
What's the matter
We're partners
Where you goin'?
Have you been there?
Thanks for sayin' that but no
Will you?
Is your son still in school?
Yes thank you
But not you
This is me at my most masochistic
What you got
Huh
Hey baby
That goodfornothing dog of yours got his ass  in the living room and acted a damn fool
There's broken glass everywhere and you could cut yourself
Nikki
Now baby me and Mommy's friend got some grownup talk  to talk about
And I want you to leave us alone till I tell you to come out
Sure
Her code name was Copperhead
You still take cream and sugar
You can relax for now
Look
No no no no no
That'd be even Vernita
I don't care
So when do we do this
When do you wanna die
We won't be bothered
I know he didn't qualify that shit
Weapon of choice
For that I'm sorry
When engaged in combat...  the vanquishing of thine enemy can be the warrior's only concern
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat
# Well #  # I'm just a single fellow with a lot on my mind #  # And I'm lookin' for me a woman #  # But she's mighty hard to find #  # Asked my country cousin #  # Checked the hottest spots in town #  # Oh that little bitty woman #  Well give me the gory details Son Number One
Groom
It's like a goddamn Nicaraguan death squad
You better shitcan that blasphemy boy
This ain't no squirrelly amateur
Don't know
We've been calling her "The Bride"  on account of the dress
Look at her
Point in fact I despise you
Dying in our sleep is a luxury  that our kind is rarely afforded
I'm standing over her right now
Will you keep your voice down
May I say one thing
But her heart just kept on beating
And the reason we won't do that thing  is because that thing would lower us
Come on home honey
Don't you ever wake up
At this moment this is me at my most masochistic
20 40 60 75
No punching her
But spit or no no punching
After that it's all good buddy
Keep the noise down
Bon appetit good buddy
Time's up buddy
Please stop hitting me
Bullshit
I'm from Huntsville Texas
Wait a minute
Wiggle your big toe
...I could see the faces of the cunts who did this to me
At a time when I knew the least about my enemies  the first name on my death list  ORen Ishii was the easiest to find
ORen Ishii was born on an American military base  in Tokio Japan
Look at my mouth
Do I look familiar
Hard part's over
Welcome to Air O
American
You said "domo.
You said "domo.
Oh just a minute
We have a customer
Shut up
Um "arigato.
Um I already said "domo" right
Good good good
Serious business
I mean arigato
No kidding
Oh my God
Uh drink
Sake
How come I always have to get the sake
I'm not bald okay
First time in Japan
I came to see a man
Never
Hattori Hanzo
Wait
You like samurai swords
...I no longer make instruments of death
Then give me one of these
It will take me a month...  ...to make the sword
I've done this because philosophically  I am sympathetic to your aim
I can tell you with no ego this is my finest sword
The young girl in the schoolgirl uniform  is ORen's personal bodyguard 17yearold Gogo Yubari
Do you like Ferraris
See what I mean
The night ORen assumed power over the crime council
What's the meaning of this outburst
You're disrespecting our sister
Shut up
Bastard
...I'm going to say this in English
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion
The price you pay  for bringing up either my Chinese or American heritage  as a negative is I collect your fucking head
Hey yeah
You have to say "Yes yes yes" to any selfish demands they make
You're gonna get your head chopped off
Charlie Brown
I don't care bring them goddammit
Hi
And you're Black Mamba
But I beg you
Is that what I think it is
# I'm doin'#  # Ain't nobody doin' but me #  # Nobody but me #  # Yes I gonna philly I'm doin'
They belong to me now
This is Hattori Hanzo steel
But as last looks go  you could do worse
You may not be able to fight like a samurai
Sofie
I'm so sorry
But still nothing
Burn in Hell you stupid stupid blonde
If you had to guess...  What they've been doing
What would be your guess
I want him to know what I know
And I want them all to know  they'll all soon be as dead as ORen
She must suffer to her last breath
Master..
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese..
You are here to learn the mysteries of Kung Fu not linguistics
What training do you possess
Your socalled exquisite art is only fit for...  Japanese fat heads
Yes
So my pathetic friend... ls there anything that you can do well
I despise the Goddamn Japs
If...  ... you land a single blow  I'll bow down and call you master
Let's see your Tiger Crane... match my Eagle's Claw
Yes
If you can stop me... l suggest you try
No
I can but not that close
It's the wood that should fear your hand...   not the other way around
OK Pai Mei
l  give  you  my  word... ﻿1 Forget it
I'm always right too
I sound like a sensible fuckin' man
Since I'm never gonna do it again you're never gonna have to hear me quack
I got all tonight to quack
Takin' more of a risk
Why should they give a fuck
Did it work
The point of the story isn't a little girl
The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone
What've we been talkin' about
They make it too personal
See how far that gets you
What then
Garcon means boy
They're not expectin' to get robbed
Same as banks these places are insured
They're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin' the diners
One minute they're havin' a Denver omelet...  the next someone is stickin' a gun in their face
You got the idea of takin' their wallets
A lot of wallets
Let's do it
You're crowd control
<i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get down with the boogie.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get it on.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get down with the boogie.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get it on.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get up with the boogie.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get up with the get down.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Get down and boogie.</i>  <i> Jungle boogie</i> <i> Shake it around.</i>   Okay so tell me again about the hash bars
Hash is legal there right
It's legal to buy it
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam it's illegal for them to search you
You'd dig it the most
What
And I don't mean just like no paper cup
They got the metric system
That's right
You know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup
I seen 'em do it man
Not sure
So that means that it could be up to five guys up there
How did Marsellus and her meet
Pilot
Well you know the shows on TV
Some don't become nothin'
Used to call him ' "Tony Rocky Horror.
He's Samoan
What about him
A foot massage
That's it
Nigger fell through that
But still you play with matches you get burned
It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife
It's not
Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither
Got my technique down and everything
I don't be ticklin' or nothin'
I'm gettin' a little pissed here
Yeah it is
I ain't sayin' it's right but you sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothin'
We act like they don't but they do
And Antwan should've fuckin' better known better
Mia
No man
Just take her out
It's definitely not a date
You know who we are
You're Brett right
Whatcha havin'
Cheeseburgers
No no no
I hear they got some tasty burgers
Yeah
They're real tasty
But I do love the taste of a good burger
A Royale with Cheese
What's in this
Sprite
You know why we're here
I don't remember askin' you a goddamned thing
We happy
Vincent
My name's Pitt and your ass ain't talkin' your way outta this shit
Really
Oh you were finished
What
Do you speak it
Yes
I dare ya
Does he look... like a bitch
You tried to fuck him
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace
Ezekiel 25:17
I think you gonna find when all this shit is over and done..
Now that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life
Besides Butch...  how many fights you think you got in you anyway
The night of the fight you may feel a slight sting
It never helps
'Cause a year from now when you kickin' it in the Caribbean...  you gonna say to yourself "Marsellus Wallace was right.
Our man in Amsterdam
The big man's right over there takin' care of some business
All right
Not yet
I got to piss
Asshole
Vincent Vega's in the house
What's up
I'll lend it to you
Forget that gun
Sex thing
Vincenzo
Different but equally good
There's nothing wrong with these two
Are we in Inglewood
That's a bold statement
All right
I'm outta balloons
Is a baggie all right
She ain't got a boyfriend
Thank you
Still got your Malibu
Fuckin' keyed it
I had it in storage for three years
Don't fuck with another man's Vehicle
Mind if I shoot up here
<i>Billy Raye was a preacher's son.</i>  <i>And when his daddy would Visit</i> <i>he'd come along</i>  Vincent
It's on the wall by the two African fellows
What the fuck is this place
Good evening ladies and gentlemen
Wallace
Just a minute
Vincent
I think it's like a wax museum with a pulse
I'll have that
How do you want that shake Martin and Lewis or Amos 'n Andy
That's milk and ice cream
That's five dollars
<i>The streets are filled with regret.</i>  Think nothin' of it
How long were you there
What was it
What
She was the leader
Knives
Tell me
Tell me
That's what I'm afraid of Vince
Martin and Lewis
I don't have cooties
Goddamn that's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake
I don't know
Well I don't think we're quite there yet but don't feel bad
I'm gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose
Goddamn
There's two Monroes
No there's not
However...  you seem like a really nice person and I..
I do
You can't promise somethin' like that
Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility
What did you think about what happened to Antwan
You know him
Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus
They
I'm not shy
Did it involve the ' "F" word
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourthstory window...  for massaging my feet seemed reasonable
But did it happen
Truth is nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out that window...  except Marsellus and Tony
Now who will be our first contestants
I wanna dance
So dance good
And how 'bout your fella here
Take it away
That's a little bit more information than I needed Vince but go right ahead
Say good night... and go home

Stop talking to me
We're losing her
Some book
It's like a textbook they give to nurses
I don't know
You're never gonna find anything in this mess
Pig
That's it
A magic marker
A fuckin' black magic marker
Hurry up man
I never done this either
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to your house then I give her the shot
All right tell me what to do
But it's gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart
Okay
She's supposed to come out of it like that
Three
Mia
Well I'm of the opinion that if Marsellus lived his whole life...  he doesn't need to know nothing about this incident
Mum's the word
No you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny
I can't wait
Ketchup
<i> Stand up
He was in the POW camp with Daddy
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together over five years

How you doing
Says he don't know nothin'
I think Butch surprised his ass same as us
I will take care of it
Hey mister
Tell me you're him
Sorry about that Floyd
What are you a weirdo
What does it feel like to kill a man
The name is Spanish but I am Colombian
I'm an American honey
I want to know what it feels like to kill a man
I don't feel the least bit bad about it
Hey fuck him Scotty
It's over now
How long to collect
It'll probably take us a couple days to get down to Knoxville
You're goddamn right
And... here's a little something for the effort
Is that better sugar pop
Pretty hard
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower
You were looking at yourself in the mirror and you wish you had some pot
Shut up fatso
No
But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy
If you had a pot belly I would punch you in it
I'd smother you
Good job sugar pop
You didn't listen to theOw
Sure am

Do you love me
Yes
But you first
No retard from the fight
My name is Fabi

If we wanted we could live in Bora Bora
Well you do not speak BoraBoran either
What does that mean
What time is it
What is this you're watching
A motorcycle movie
No imbecile what was your dream about
Well let's look at the grumpy man in the morning
Get up lazy bones
11:00
To drinka tall glass of orange juice and a black cup of coffee
Any time of the day is a good time for pie
Yes I've fuckin' looked
You sure you got it
Yeah well it's not here now
Now think
I believe so
Are you sure
It's not your fault
I reminded you about it...  but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me
Just means I can't have breakfast with you
Well that's what I'm gonna find out
I saw your watch
I'll be back before you can say blueberry pie
Okay
I specifically reminded her  Bedside table on the kangaroo
Do you think he's dead
If you need someone to go to court I'll be glad to help
He hit you then he crashed into that car
Shut the fuck up
Now you just wait a goddamn minute now
You'd better kill me  Yeah somebody's gonna get killed
<i>It's time.</i>  <i> To find love</i>  Take your foot off the nigger

You tried to fuck him and Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked...  by anybody except Mrs. Wallace
Ezekiel 25:17
I'm fucked
Marvin Vincent
Marvin
I'd knock that shit off if I was you
It was bigger than him
We was lucky
That means that God came down from heaven and stopped the bullets
Don't do that
Wrong
Do you want to continue this theological discussion in a car...  or in a jailhouse with the cops
I was watching it one time and there was this cop on...  and he was talkin' about this gunfight he had in the hallway with this guy right
I mean you know it's freaky but it happens
What the fuck does that mean
I said don't do that
Don't worry I will
Man I don't even have an opinion
Oh man I shot Marvin in the face
The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump
Look at this fuckin' mess
Just take it to a friendly place that's all
What you doing
Just listen up man
Me and my homeboy are in a car and we gotta get it off the road pronto
He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin
He wasn't expectin' this shit
I was washin' 'em
Maybe if he'd had Lava I coulda done a better job
Fine
Just go handle your friend
And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us
What
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen
I wanna ask you a question
No
No marriage counselor
Man you know fuck I wanna help you but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it
Now look you know she comes home from work in about an hour and a half
Well then do it and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here
Do me that favor all right

You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is
You ain't got no problem Jules

Which would make you... Vincent
One hundred percent
Uhhuh
Take me to it
Lotsa cream lotsa sugar
Does it make a lot of noise
Positive
You two
That would lead me to believe you got cleansers and shit
Go in the back seat scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull
What you need to take care of are the really messy parts
Can't use 'em
Please would be nice
I'm not here to say please
No Mr. Wolf it ain't like that; your help is definitely appreciated
I just don't like people barkin' orders at me
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova
Nobody who'll be missed
Okay

Dog eats its own feces
I mean he'd have to be 10 times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres
You're startin' to lighten up
Miracle you witnessed
Act of God
See that shit don't matter
But what is significant is I felt the touch of God
You're really thinkin' about quittin'
First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus
What you mean "'Walk the earth"
I'll just be Jules Vincent
No Jules you decided to be a bum...  just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change...  who sleep in garbage bins eat what I throw away

What I asked is how's it go
You guys are like making me lose my train of thought here
Oh Τoby's that little Chinese girl
You said Τrue Blue was about a guy...  A sensitive girl who meets a nice guy but Like A Virgin was a metaphor for big dicks
Ηow many dicks is that
Pain
Τoby Chew
You see the pain is reminding a fuck machine  what it was once like to be a virgin  hence... Like A Virgin
What do you mean when we leave
For the past 15 minutes now you've been droning on about names
Fucking Charlie Chan!
Well then I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it
(Laughter)  You guys been listening to ΚBilly's Super Sounds of the '70s Weekend
I haven't heard that since I was in the fifth fuckin' grade
When it was big I must have heard it a million trillion fuckin' times
I just heard it
You guys can get the tip
Come on throw in a buck
You don't tip
Τhey make shit
I don't tip because society says I have to
What's special
Six times
What if she's too fuckin' busy
I used to work minimum wage  and I wasn't lucky enough to have a job society deemed tipworthy
Τhey serve food
Waitressing is the numberone occupation  for female noncollege graduates in this country
Τhat's fucked up
It appears waitresses are one of the groups  the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis
All right ramblers let's get ramblin'

It's not good no

You don't have to take me in
Just look in my eyes Larry
You'll be safe man
You're gonna wish you were dead but it takes days to die from your wound
Orange got tagged
Τhe cops shot him
Τhis is so fuckin' bad

Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars
You better start thinking about it because I am
Τhere could've been cops here waiting for us

A few cops
Τhat was the most insane fuckin' thing I have ever seen
What the fuck was Joe thinking
I mean everybody panics  everybody
Τhen you give yourself a couple of seconds you get a hold of the situation   you deal with it
I mean Jesus Christ how old do you think that black girl was  20
After that I don't know what went down
No chance they punched through
Yeah and that was a fuckin' miracle
Where
Τhat was the plan
(Mr White sighs)  I swear to God I think I'm fuckin' jinxed
Two jobs back it was a fourman job
Mr Blue
Maybe he set it up...  No I don't bite
Ηey that kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take  so don't you be calling him a rat
Where's the commode in this dungeon
Go down the hall make a left go up the stairs and make a right
We were for a little while
Good little thief

I'd say around 20
But on this particular day they're getting a shipment of polished stones from lsrael
Juicy Junior   real juicy
I'm gonna check into a motel for a few days
I thought he was dead for sure
What are we gonna do
First things first
Joe could help
If we could get in touch with Joe...  Joe could get him to a doctor
Ηe planned a robbery and he's got a blood bath on his hands
Ηe begged me to do it
You didn't tell him your name did you
What was telling him your name when you weren't supposed to
We had just gotten away from the cops
Ηe's screamin'
Τell him "I'm sorry I can't give out that fuckin' information "  "it's against the rules"
I got a question  do they have a sheet on you where you're from
If I have to tell you again to back off we are gonna go round and round
What the fuck are you touching me for man
Fuck you White I didn't create this situation I'm dealing with it
L  didn't tell him my name or where I was from
If you wanna throw bad looks somewhere throw 'em at a mirror
(Mr Pink) What happened to you
Τhat's what we were wondering about
You better start talking asshole...  cause we got shit we need to talk about
Τhis place ain't secure
We're leaving
What's this guy's problem
Τhat fuckin' shooting spree
Τhey deserve what they got
I'm sorry I didn't catch it
What are we on a playground here huh
You said that
Ηe's too homicidal to be in with the cops
Somebody stuck a redhot poker up our ass  and I wanna know whose name's on the handle
Look I know I'm no piece of shit and I'm pretty sure you're OK  and I'm positive you're on the level  so let's try and figure out who the bad guy is all right
I got something outside that er I'd like to show you guys so follow me
Yeah
Come on
What for the cops
Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place
So in the meantime  let me show you guys something
Maybe our boy in blue here can answer some of these questions  about this rat business you been talking about
I know you'll pay me back
You do what everybody else does
Come on in
A friend of mine's outside
It's a change
Who's your parole officer
Ηe's a fuckin' asshole
What the hell was I supposed to do forget about you
I see you sitting there but I don't believe it

About the thick fat steaks she picked up at the butcher's today
I won't let you
I ain't puttin' up with that
Victim number four
Settle down and think straight
Eileen's at home waitin' for you
Hell of a way to start my retirement
You've been very quiet
The briefest indulgement in automotive pleasure
Such shortlived durability Mr. Shlubb
A dent the merest scratch thereupon  and beforementioned consequences which I made mention  shall surely be athwart us
I'm making sure they get along really well
That's all
it'd be like this
No need to play it quiet
He likes to hear 'em scream
a flesh wound
Sure I can
I don't want you watching this
[screaming]    to end a partnership
Never better
Run for your life
Don't listen to him
Sit down or I'll blast you in half
She'll be safe
I don't mind much
What they're saying about you and that child
Come on Hartigan what's holding you back
I'm not the only one on the force who smells it
Evenin' officer
This being an election year you've seen plenty of my picture
They say he may never come out of it
Power comes from lying
Everyone would lie for me everyone who counts
You're gonna keep on living a long time
You tell her the truth and she's dead
They talked my parents into keeping me away
That's gonna mean a lot to me
Don't visit me
That's the name of a really cool detective in books I read
It's not safe for you here
Mr. High and Mighty
He doesn't look good
I rented her out of Old Town
If you stop being stupid start playing along with us  you might just get some of Tammy
She heard about you and that little girl
At first I figure she'll send another note or two  before her young mind moves on to better things
I do my best to keep my hand from shaking when I reach for it
Then another Thursday with no letter
Not a word from Nancy
Of course
How long did you expect her to keep writing
This guy smells awful like bad food
How the hell did they find her
I've got to help her
You beat me
Hartigan my God it is you
on me back before the trial
They're scared of something
You're gonna be exonerated
This isn't like you think it is
I'm gonna confess
All right you son of a bitch
I love you Nancy
Long as you stay in front of me
Eight years
Yeah
Like you said Bob water under the bridge
How did they find out who you are
What has he done to Nancy
Closest thing to a clue is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon
Cold night like this everybody's looking for somebody stranger
She filled out
And here I was expecting a skinny little bookworm  maybe a bit too shy for her own good
They were bluffing
Just a few seconds and she'll be safe
Whatever you say Hartigan
Me and my dumb letters
Nobody but me can keep this heap running
Taken it to the range a couple of times
You've never been far from my thoughts
Damn
He's got skill but he's in too much of a hurry
Gotta confirm the kill
It's OK. You did great
No
And it's all over the place
But the creep himself he's gone
Nancy I went to your apartment
I'm such an asshole
You should sit down
All these years
Why do you think I kept writing you those letters
No
Recognize my voice Hartigan
Sure
It's all gone to hell
My tools better be clean and sharp
I get to do whatever I want however I want whenever I want it
Since you've been gone I'm having the time of my life
Nancy don't scream
I'm gonna take all night doing dear old Nancy
If there weren't so many people hereabout  I would show you how I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream
This is it
Move
No alarm
Protest though you might Mr. Klump  you must nonetheless admit to the sheer phallic majesty  of said Ferrari's performance
Irrelevant to said mission is the following query  which I now put forth to you:  Wherein this most streamlined  and trunkless of transports  bonerinspiring though it may be  wherein are we to reposit our recently deceased cargo
The answer you seek is rural even agrarian
Once things get loud I'll have use for the cannons
You kept your mouth shut
Don't scream
Bad cough
Doesn't matter now
You'll crack
You'll scream
You're pathetic
Damn
Stupid old man
Let her go
Nancy I'm sorry
Here it comes
So long Junior
I didn't scream
She's herself again
You better get rolling
I'm gonna put Senator Roark behind bars where he belongs
Get Senator Roark behind bars
Roark's lost his goddamn legacy
He'll go after me through Nancy
Not as long as I'm alive
Sure
I didn't come here for the party
It's not just your face  your figure or your voice
You're sick of running
She's soft and warm and almost weightless
I tell her I love her
It's not the city
It should be right as rain in no time
She's telling me she wants me
I'm not gonna waste one more second wondering how I've gotten so lucky
She says her name is Goldie
Not a mark on her
It sure as hell wasn't my looks
Whoever killed you is gonna pay Goldie
It'll be loud and nasty my kind of kill
I was just grazed
Go ahead
You're the best
Didn't happen to kill any of them
How do you suppose I'm gonna square this with the board
Or some creep with a gas can trying to torch someone
They're back
And I'm ready for war
[helicopter passing]  [Marv] Now for Gladys
Mom still hasn't changed a thing in this room
She's almost lived up to the name
Marvin
They weren't police
Mom I feel better than I have in years
I'm gonna find that son of a bitch that killed you  and I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye
...and you could find anything
Nancy's just getting started with her gig  but already the crowd's breathing hard
Tell him I've been hitting the joints drunk off my butt  shooting my mouth off crying over some hot babe named Goldie
He just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century
He'd be right at home on some ancient battlefield  swinging an ax into somebody's face
What
A fine coat you're bleeding all over it
Who sent you
For a second I smell the angel smell that belonged to my Goldie
You're gonna pay for what you did to me
How many for the kill
your sins my son
You might say I been working my way up the food chain
But it was Connelly the money man who fingered you Padre
It's all there
Modern cars: they all look like electric shavers
Goldie
This is a bad place this farm
I got no gripe with you
It's impossible
It was you you bastard
A killer born
Lucille
It's him
Let's get you warm
The heads on the wall
He made me watch
Any leads
Goldie
But I didn't know that
[horn honks]  [man] Kevin
They're coming this way
He's unconscious and unarmed  so there's no need to kill him
Captain the target there's no sign of him
Just a name: Patrick Henry Roark man of the cloth
Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts
What if I've imagined all of this
What if I've turned into what they've always said I was gonna turn into
For an hour or so I ask around about Goldie
He's crazy
Because that's my name you ape
Goldie was my sister
You crazy goddamn broad
Shoot me now or get the hell out of my way
Nuts
I thought I might be able to talk some sense into you
I know that sounds crazy
No it doesn't
so I'm in this one to the end
You know the way I look
It's almost killing time and I'd better get sharp
Kill him for me Marv
Come on you son of a bitch
I can take it
My muscles make me a thousand promises of pain to come
I'm good and bushed
Could have been a real mess around here  if I didn't have that tubing for tourniquets
Here he comes
He never screams
There isn't much of anything Nancy wouldn't do for me
What do you want me to do with her
Things start to make sense
I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up
What's left of him anyways
He had the voice of an angel yet he spoke only to me
Tearful he swore to me that he felt the touch of God Almighty
I know it's pretty damn weird to eat people
You were so convenient
Kevin killed her
No satisfaction
Everything up until the killing will be a gas
[man] Freeze
Months fall off the calendar while I breathe and eat through tubes
They just keep knocking the crap out of me and waving a confession in my face
From then on it's the circus everybody wants it to be
My only visitor
I got confused again
The goddess
It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's
You heard the man
It has to mean something to you
I forgive you for that without you asking me to
That hurt Shellie
Get help and get lost
This clown's got a big mean drunk on
Jackie Boy it's a regular African love fest in here
And the whole time you've been doing me like this  I've been too polite to point out that any time I want to  I could kick this damn door to splinters
You know what I can do
None of these bozos got lives they gotta hang out with you
Who is he
He flew out the window just as soon as he heard you were coming   'cause you scared him so bad
You goddamn bastard
[men laughing]  Wish you'd dropped by earlier Jackie Boy
But I forgive you
It's a jungle out there
Hey baby I don't hear you making those calls
You're making a big mistake man
Troops get outta here
I don't think he'll be bothering you again
I've done some dumb things
I'll call you later
It's a chance I shouldn't be taking  but I can't go home and forget about it  and let Jackie Boy and his pals find their fun
You fool
That's a good way to get yourself noticed
Not for long
The cop shuts off his siren
Squad car's long gone
None of us ever doubted you for a second
Hey baby
We'll just talk
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street
That's far enough Dwight
arguing with her
Wound up a little tight aren't we
That and your lousy taste in women
He's outta control
And she's been aching for some practice
Turn around
So why this rotten feeling in my gut that something is awfully wrong
I can't place it
I'm a little on edge
It's a good night's sleep
I've seen all shapes all sizes
This is crazy
Go ahead
Yeesh
Don't anyone laugh
It'll backfire
I can't see
Then it's straight to business:  Stretching corpses out on the floor and going through their pockets  divvying up cash when they find it
His wallet is packed
I thought Shellie said "stop.
The girls administer their own brand of justice
That's the rules
It'll be war
The mob
We'll go to war
I'll hide the bodies
Get that out of my face or I'll smack ya
And you were gone off playing with that barmaid
They won't be watching the roads
If I don't make it you can have your war
A hardtop with a decent engine
Always... and never
Gail
Dry your hair as soon as you get home
Gail said no calls
What were they thinking  sticking me with a beatup bucket of bolts like this
It's got you smoking there bud
It's got you hearing things
You know it's true
Those hookers let you down
Not unless you keep your eyes on the road sugar pie
Shut up
You're flushed
Sure I'm just imagining that he's talking
For all I know he's an honest cop regular guy  a working stiff with a mortgage a wife and a pile of kids
You're making him mad
Your friend here... party a little too hard tonight
A few minutes' more work and it'll all be over
We're in lockdown
Your cause is lost
But it is within your power to save many lives  by facilitating the process of transition  by negotiating the terms of the surrender of Old Town
I know you
I can't fathom these Americans always whining  and going on about how they got it so bad
Where else would one bullet buy us the fortune that we're getting for this
It's all bent up
It's the bullet
And everything seemed to be going so well
There we go
Only the horrid oily tar taste creeping up my nostrils
You're Elvis
Dwight they got Gail
We gotta find out who it is and rescue Gail
Stay smart
Get the head
if Miho is alive or dead  but I'm on my feet and every ounce of me wants to get some killing done
I'm as helpless as a baby
Here's me with all these fine grenades and such a sweet beauty of a remote
But it's me knife I'll be doing you with
[crunching]  He feels it
I mean the man's an artist
Your skin is perfect
There's no fighting them
You little bitch
We could have protected her and you know it
Sure there's money
Your neck
Schutz fetch my blades
I knew there was a reason I got out of bed this morning
There's something wrapped around it
It's poked right through me
Everyone
Guys
Sometimes you can beat the odds with the careful choice of where to fight
Wait a minute
Now if you'll explain to me why we shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...  Dwight what have you done
Cute trick McCarthy but it will do you no good
No
Every last one
Deadly little Miho
Who the hell are you and what happened to them

Then you approach...  Molasseslike

Not quite
One of my fella's over there is worth four  thousand one's worth three and one's worth one
Back off
Okay boy we'll give it a try
Yeah
I got it
We get goin' a lot quicker you help out too
And my wrist is gonna' stay cuffed to hers and  she ain't never gonna' leave my goddamn side  until I personally put her in the red rock jail
That's too bad
You could say he was my best friendif I  considered stupid animals firends which I don't
No I do not have mixed emotions
You know I am
Never
I don't wanna' work that hard
When the handbill says dead or alive the rest of  us shoot ya' in the back from up on top of a perch  somewhere bring ya' in dead over a saddle
You got it
I know we only met each other once before
The Lincoln letter
Look I know you gotta' be real careful with it and all
That gets me
It's a letter from Lincoln
Of all the stupid  like to rip my goddamn arm off
You ruin that letter of his  that niggers gonna' stomp your ass to death
She didn't help it none
What
Considerin I'm one half of them fellas yeah..
But with a partner eighteen's a whole lot better
If you say so
Okay..
Walk over there where I can get a good look at cha'
I'm sorry friend do we know each other
Whoever you are mister  you sure sound tough when you're talkin' to a desperate man knee deep in snow
Who is this joker
You got business in red rock
Horseshit
You got anything that can back any of this up
When we get to red rock
Daisy domergue
Well I'll be double dogged damned
Yeah it's really me and it's really my head
Well..
No
Could you come down here and join us
And I'm gonna' enter my town in bounty hunters chains
There ain't no bounty on my head bushwacker
Give the major back his iron
Y'all wanna' lie on the ground and make snow angels together
A bunch of losers gone loco you bet I do
Sounds to me you been readin' a lotta' newspapers printed in Washington D.C.  Anywho I'm just tryin' to let y'all know grateful I am
You wanna' show me how grateful you are..
Do I know about the thirty thousand dollar reward  the confederacy put on the head of major marquis
No they didn't
Once passions had colled it dropped down to eight then five
What's...  Wellenbeck
You ain't never heard of wellenbeck prisoner of war camp West Virginia
There was a rookie regiment spendin' the overnight in that camp
I'm suppose to apologize for killin' Johnny reb
Shoot 'em
But you had a surprise waitin' for you on the northern side didn't ya'
You burnt up some of your own boys didn't ya' major
I think they thought thirtyseven white men for one nigger  wasn't so hot a trade
If he did all that the cavalry woulda' shot him
Cavalry tends to look kindly on that
Mannix's marauders that's what
We deserved dignity in defeat
I think I'll just look out this winda'  let this beatuiful carriage rock me to sleep
I can see you already got another one up in here
I'm running the place while they're gone
Where's minnie and sweet Dave
I just put those other horses away
Come on let's go
What
Hold it shut
Two pieces of wood
Gimme the nail
That door's a son of a gun
About forty minutes ago
I think we all felt the same way but were a little too polite to say something

Get your hand outta' there
Then you can share bananas with your nigger friend in the stable
He's just talkin' his self outta' freezin' to death is all
You never gave your name sir
May I see it
You're suppose to produce it upon request
Yes
Transporting a desperate hostile prisoner such as her  sounds like hard work
He's gotta' make a living too
So it would appear
No I can't say I have
Jolly good
You go inside and get some hot coffy
So me an' Chris better lay out a line  from the stable to the front door and from the front door to the shithouse
Come on Chris
Muchas gracias
John Ruth wants to take you back to red rock to stand trail for murder
Now the good part  about frontier justice is it's very thirst quenching
In your case you'd have it  comin'
To me it dosen't matter what you did
I hang you in red rock I move on to the next town I hang someone else there
No offense cowboy fella' just gettin' your attention
You bet I am
Who's askin'
So...  Who are you
That's my name Joe gage
I got back from a long drive and..
Yeah well...  You know looks can be deceiving
Now is that... good enough for you
General
I've been called worse
Sorry to bother you
You gotta' nail it shut
You gotta' hammer another one
I got it
Thank you
Hardly no
Really
Horseshit
In my beg
Of course
I don't think that was the original idea but...  That's the idea now
Yeah
The Lincoln what
The black fella' in the stable
Warren
Minnie and sweet Dave went to visit her mother on the north side of the mountain
Everybody's got a mother
Not yet I ain't
Secondly  I can't imagine sweet Dave liftin' his fat ass  outta' his chair long enough to fetch well water  unless minnie was layin' a fryin' pan upside his head
But I still haven't done it yet
"Red apple tobacco"  but mi negro amigo I think you already know this
Yeah
Well cut my legs off and call me shorty...  Is that genaral sanford smithers I see
Yes sir
I heard you gave those blue bellies sweet hell
Yankees sons of bitches
That would be nice
So what brings you out Wyoming way sir
No forgiveness needed son
It was after he served his service
No chance he could be livin' "the cold life" out in  the woods
Who's the idiot who broke the damn door
We need two pieces of wood
You seem to have a laissez faire attitude when it comes to the hats
I have a laissez faire attitude about the hats
You know my daddy I said that my daddy
O.B.
And that's all I need to know
On the other side
You captured a whole colored command that day
Nor the inclination to care for northern horses  and least of all northern niggers
And if you shoot this unarmed old man I guarantee  I will hang you by the neck until you are dead
Gentlemen since we may be trapped here  close together like for a few days  may I suggest a possible solution
We could say that the fireplace side of the room  acts as a symbolic representative of...  Georgia  while the bar represents...  Philadelphia
And they got 'em coupla' days
So all they gotta' do  is sit tight and wait for a winda' of opportunity
He won't have the leather patience it takes to just sit here and wait
What do I got to say
She's wanted dead or alive for murder
Ten thousand dollars
Really
Circumstances force me to take...  Precautions
Nothing personal
A bastards work is never done huh John Ruth
You want it
Take his pistol
I'm afraid the same applies to you too Mr.  Mobray
Why do I gotta' go outside
Okay
No I sure don't
Till they invent a trigger a woman can't pull if  you're a hang man you're going to hang woman
But mean bastards you need to hang
I ain't never going out in that shit ever ever again
So...  How you doin' black major
I ain't in the mood Chris mannix
So...   You got a letter from Abraham Lincoln
Of America
As in: "Dear maj. Warren"
No you may not
But the way John tells it you weren't just some  random nigger soldier picked from a pile of letters
Was all that horseshit
Well I guess it's true what they say about you people
But you got no idea what it's like being a black man facin' down America
Got me on that stagecoach didn't it
Good for you sister
I suppose you were there
Got both my arms
Betsy
God damnit
He spoke highly of his mama too
You did not know my boy
No
All they found was me
"If you just let me home to my family I'll  swear I'll never set foot in Wyoming again.
And when I knew me I had the son
General smithers don't you listen to him he didn't know your boy
I made him strip
Then he commits to begging again
All he wanted... was a blanket
You  ain't never been cold as your boy was that day
And Chester Charles smithers  sucked on that warm black dingus for long as he could
Your boy...  Black dudes dingus in his mouth
Kinda' like those uniforms the union issued those colored troopers  that you chose not to acknowledge
He was your boy
Hey ozzy hey you got the right idea
Let's light this place up
Can I play that guitar over there
While major Warren was captivating the crowd  with tales of black dicks and white mouths...  Somebody... poisoned the coffy
Can I play that guitar over there
My pistol plays a tune
Yeah I got
Music time's over
Mannix the coffy
Don't test me bitch
You too senor Bob
You open your mouth; You gonna' get a bullet
"I got it"  "I got it"
And I mean anything
So...  You finally decided I'm tellin' the truth 'bout bein' the sheriff of red rock huh
What I say 'bout talkin
Or all y'all is..
So what charms this bitch got take a man brave a blizzard  kill in cold blood I'm sure I don't know
Like me god damnit
Yeah that's right Joe gage I'm lookin' at you
Who made the coffy
Yeah he did didn't he
And there was another fellow on the plantation uncle charly
And no matter the meat it always tasted like uncle charly's stew
This may be minnie's place but this is damn sure  sweet Dave's chair
I'm pretty goddamn sure that chair's be going with him
The way I see it senior Bob  whoever's workin' with her  ain't who they say they is
Yes
Playing silent night on the piano
My theory is...  You're working with man who poisoned the coffy
Your a real imaginative nigger ain't you
How long you say you been working for minnie's
No
Now minnie likes just about everybody but she sure don't like Mexicans
Now I am calling you a liar senior Bob
Does it Chris
I fuckin' knew it
You killed o.B
Chapter five the four passengers  earlier that morning
Well you need to tell minnie
When you're reday stop on inside  get warm by the fire get some coffy in you
I'll introduve you to minnie
Everybody this is minnie and this is her place
Hey Judy
Oswaldo mobray madame
We're just gonna' go warm ourself's by the stove if that's all right
Well I don't know 'bout all that
I'll fix you
Well I don't know what I'm suppose to do about it
It's my favorite
You play
Merci beaucoup mademoiselle minnie
Oui   oui  what is that mean
Why
How many peppermint sticks I get for a nickel
Here
I brought in your bags in case anybody wants  to change your clothes before red rock
Rock steady
Auckland what the fuck is an Auckland
Coffy's ready
Passengers not so much
Shit
To drag these fat bastards up and down the mountain that's fucking impossible mate
You realize how close you came to being tossed on a pile of niggers
You believe that
He's taking her into red rock to be hung
And when he get's here
No I don't
I don't give a damn about them or you or your sister  or any other son of a bitch in Wyoming for that matter
Maybe my name
Be an old man be dotty
Deal
Tidied around minnie's
Now killin' that fella' 'fore he kills my sister ain't gonna' be easy
Good luck mate
I can see you already got another one up in here
I'm running the place while they're gone
Who are you
You heard him freeloaders get to work
Kick it open
I think I'm gonna die
How you doin'
Worry about these owl hoots and that bushwhacker nuts shooter in the basement
No no no no
Don't shoot her
Now throw out your other pistol
Told ya'
It took him too long so I done for him
Joe gage get your ass over and shut this trap door
Don't you see that nigger and John Ruth put you smack dab in the middle of danger
I'll bite... why
Well who the hell is Jody domergue
Jody's got fifteen men waitin' in red rock
Now with brohter deadd I'm in charge of this gang right boys
No deals bitch
All right bitch
Bob's real name is "Marco the Mexican"
Precisely yeah
You gonna talk yourself to death
Remind me  why we wouldn't just kill all y'all and cash in
Now let let's say you shoot us all..
Fifteen killer strong
You really the sheriff of red rock
You ain't done we can't forgive
Give me my pistol
So...  You were sayin'... We sit here...  All nice and friendly like...  For the next two days...  Then the snow melts  you leave here meet up with your gang and high tail it to Mexico
Calm down
Yeah
You see..
What I belive is...  Joe gage or grouch douglass whatever the fuck his name was...  Poisoned the coffy...  And you watched him do it
I believe when it comes to what's left of the Jody Doeminggrey gang..
Dead on this on this motherfuckin' floor
My daddy held up to four hundred men together after the war  with nothing but their respect in his command
Get up
Your ass ain't nailed to the floor
Now we've come to the part of the story...   Where I blow your goddamn head off
We ain't got no say in that
And that how we kill this bitich
As my first and final act as the sheriff of red rock  I sentence you domergue  to hang by the neck until dead
Dear marquis..
I'm very proud everytime I hear new of you...  We still have a long way to go but hand in hand..
