Let's go
Wait
Maybe four
Can we hurry this up
Right
Let the circle be unbroken...  until the day
This is rumor control
The survivor is a woman
You will be pleased to know that I have requested a rescue team
And evacuate her A.S.A.P
I would think so
Correct
there ain't gonna be much left
Sort of eyeopener
It's one of WeylandYutani's backwater work prisons,  it grieves me to say
You crashlanded in an E.E.V
Where are the others
They didn't make it
Neither have I, for that matter
This used to be a 5,000 convict facility,  but it's been reduced to a custodial staff of 25
The inmates forge lead sheets for toxic waste containers
There was a droid
There were bits and pieces of him all over the place
Um, I'm sorry
I have to be sure how she died
Was she your daughter
No
I told you,  we have to make sure how she died
Well, perhaps you'd like to share that reason
Please
There's no sign of infection
Lungs
I don't believe you've met Lieutenant Ripley
Well, first  the lieutenant is feeling much better, I'm happy to say
Good
We have to cremate the bodies
I thought you said there was no sign of disease
An outbreak of cholera would look extremely bad on a report
I try not to offend their convictions
For my own personal safety
Ah, Christmas has come early, Murph
Smelly bastards, all covered in lice
What do you mean, if I got the chance
I've never had any problem with the ladies
Anything I can do to be of service?
I'd be happy to kiss her ass
Can't go wrong
How old was she
Right
"Their bodies...  "have been taken from the shadow of our nights
Why the pain
There aren't any promises
I'll tell you, it's fucking weird
She's already changed everything
Come on
I'll tell ya
Yeah
Well, he's going with you
As I thought, Mr. Aaron
You called it, sir
Not much
Enough even for you
That's just a statement of principle
Tincture
What kind of religion
How do you like your new haircut
You attracted to me
I've been out here a long time
Spikey
I just want to know why we had to cremate the bodies
Possibly
Really
I'm not a prisoner
We are rather spoiling things, aren't we
We've had an accident
One of our prisoners has been... diced
Who was it
He was a wanker
I take it he was pulled into the fan
Except the fan was blowing
One of the prisoners has been killed
Poor soul backed into a ninefoot fan
Look
Bishop
I have a previous engagement
It's not properly wrapped
Golic
I loved him
Uh, no thanks
At 0700 hours, I received word from the network
I may point out this is the first highlevel communication...  this installation has ever received, to my knowledge
But why did you let her out of the infirmary
I find you... unpleasant to be around
Now sit the hell down
You're unpredictable
Now, is there anything I should know
Has she said anything to youanything about where she's from, what her mission is
That's all
Nothing more
Shut up, you bitch
Shh
Son of a bitch
Cigarettes
This makes 1 76
I'm sorry
It ain't against God
Must be the wind from one of the vent shafts
Wait, wait, wait
Here
Go, go, go
Hi, Bishop
I'm just a glorified toaster
Bishop, can you access data on the flight recorder
What happened on the Sulaco
Fire in cryogenic What happened
Does the recorder indicate anything
It was with us all the way
The company knows everything that happened on the ship
Do it for me, Ripley
It was  Nobody can stop it
They got sslaughtered like pigs
I don't want him causing a panic
Now, now
It wasn't me
He's never lied to me
It was a dragon
This man is a convicted multiple murderer, known for particularly brutal crimes
lt's important
It's a beauty
This is a prison
It's not a good idea to allow prisoners access to firearms
Nothing terribly formidable
Confined to the infirmary
all report to the mess hall
Mess hall, right away, people
And that's it
Do you want to tell me what you and Andrews talked about
No
Sick to my stomach
In an insane world,  a sane man...  must... appear... insane
I used to know lots of 'em back home
Are you
Married
Try me
And during my first residency, I did a 36hour stretch on an E.R
I got seven years in prison and my license reduced to a 3C
I got to know this motley crew quite well
So, do you still trust me with a needle
the fuck is happening here
We got rape
Once again, this is rumor control
Prisoners Boggs and Rains are missing
I can only hope we are able to all pull together over the next few days...  until the rescue team arrives for Lieutenant Ripley
Stop it
We give you thanks, O Lord
And fast
Who's in fucking charge
Right
He was a good man
You take charge
I just take care of my own
Yeah
Moves differently
What about video
Nothing much works here
She's the one that brought the fucker
Hmm
Right
Then we go in there, flush it out
Zebras
But, look
I told you, nothing works
Never got around to it
Really knew how to build these babies
I forget what the stuff's called
Right
Right, 85
All right
And you want help from us ychromo boys, huh
Look at this
Man, this stuff stinks
How can I keep from breathing it
What makes you say that
Whatever you say, but, uh, you don't look okay to me, sister
There's definitely something in here with us
This is the signal
Get down
Come on
Don't open the doors
Junior
Get those sprinklers and turn them on
Come on
â™ª â™ª [ Continues ] We salute their courage
Andrews used to call them Dillon's God Squad
[ Scoffs ]  Shit, no
Look, uh  Figure the rescue team gets here in four, five days  six, tops
We're the ass end of the totem pole out here
Gotta kill it
Come on
Please, what did I do
I didn't lie
If this gets in here, I'm dead
Don't I always give you cigarettes first
But behave yourself
I mean, tight
Now what do we say
How do you spell it
Right
See
The big mothersucker will eat you alive
â™ª â™ª [ Woman Vocalizing ]  Tell me what to do next
They wanna take it back
It'll kill them all
Nothing's wrong with that... except a lot of innocent people will die
No
Uh, Dillon, we got a teenyweeny problem
Should've kept the shithead chained up
Come on
WhWhWhat do you think
Who gives a shit how she looks
We ought to panic
Whose fault is that
Sun don't come up for another two days
It's 40 below zero
Where'd she go
You shouldn't be wandering around alone
Okay, we're hot
Let it run a cycle
Little white lines
Horrible
It's out there
If it comes in, it's gotta be through one of these doors
Now we post a guard to let us know if it's coming
Oh, right
Any of you got any better ideas
Furnace
Let's make it to the furnace
Too fuckin' right it's right
The rescue team will turn back
And maybe they can do something for you
The company doesn't care about that
I know
I need that fucking code
There are no alternatives
Look, it's nothing personal
It won't kill its future
Yeah
This whole place is a basement
L'm part of the family
What are you doing out here
I stood right next to it
How do you know that thing's inside you
It can make thousands more like the one we've got here
I don't have much time,  and I can't do what I should
What the fuck are you talking about
You don't have to worry about that
What's going on
You said you were gonna kill me
And if it won't kill you, then maybe that helps us fight it
You die sitting here on your ass, or you die out there
What the fuck are you talking about
Hold it, hold it
You know that
we should go out and fight it
Nobody gives a shit about you, 85
Yeah, okay
You keep telling me how dumb I am
Fine
And all the rest of you pussies can sit it out too
But I want the same thing as you
It killed my mates too
They will not kill us
When they first heard about this thing,  it was "crew expendable.
Not one
Yeah
Oh, fuck
Nobody ever gave me nothin'
Let's kick its fucking ass
When was the last time you used this place
End of his ass
We're fucked
Because if it wants out, that's how it's gonna go
Through that alcove, through you
Eh
What the fuck, right
I don't know about this shit
I think we'd better rethink this thing
It's starting
Must be heading over to Channel "A"
Kevin
Take your best shot
Kevin, where are you
Yeah
How did I get here
What about the plan
Here, kitty, kitty
Geez, it's coming
Geez, it's on the fucking ceiling
Now I'm back in "A"
Shut
Don't hold it like that
Stay here
We have to trap it
It's gone
No
No
Come on
I got ya
I got ya
Leave him
Shit
It's coming at me
Please
Thank God you're here
Is she still alive
You fucker
Come on, you bastard
Come on
No
To the piston
Let it follow us
Come on
Come on
Shut it, Morse
Morse, shut that door
Now
Remember
I've got to hold it here
No
Pour that lead, Ripley
Is that all that you fight, motherfucker
[ Screaming ]  Pour it
Ripley
Yes
Stay where you are
Same model as Bishop
I'm not the Bishop android
Bullshit
What does that mean
You don't want to take it back
You'll be out for two hours
Let me help you
No
It was a mistake
Ripley, think of all we could learn from it
You're crazy
Get going

It would mean so much if you would talk to a few reporters...  Bloggers, give them a little Amy color
Fantastic
I thought that would be creepy
You're very cute, Nick
And this big party celebrating this fictional wedding
Because it's my understanding you are not married
Now, you had the distinct pleasure of dating Nick dunne for how long
An understandable mistake
When Nick's elderly mother breaks into an impromptu rendition...  Of New York, New York, every time she sees you
You are brilliant, yet entirely unsnobby
Isn't it time we fixed that
But given the scene at your house...  And given our spike in violent crime of late...  We are gonna take this very, very seriously
Okay
Okay
Yeah, it's just all of a sudden, I feel like I'm on a law & order episode
I just wanna help
So, what does Amy do most days
Doing what
I know a few housewives, that evening glass of wine starts coming at noon
Has Amy got friends we can talk to
You know, we have a pretty serious homeless problem..
You got to the bar around 11:00 today
I went to Sawyer beach and read the news
Ivy league
She's complicated
Speaking of which, Amy's blood type
New York
You haven't called your wife's parents yet
I've been in here talking to you
Should I know my wife's blood type
This is detective boney
This is my father
I've been right there

Dad, stop
I think that would be wise

Not for me and Nick

Now, Amy needs your help
Mr. elliott, when was the last time you spoke to your daughter
Thank you
Do you know about desi collings
Twenty years ago
She filed charges
I only know it was bad
You got a minute
Imagine our confusion
Okay
Afterschool meeting, don't mind if I do
Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two
"We'll play hot, doting husband, sweet, loving spouse.
I blush
My wife's first pet
It's... it's..
Are you following me
What you doing
From the clue
"So open the door, and look alive.
Like who
All those awful couples we know
Everything else is background noise
My turn
Amy, if you're laid off...  And I'm laid off..
Their money, technically
More games
Laptoping
What are you talking about
Why are you throwing that in my face again
I'm not that person
I've never not had a job
Hold on
Father
Jodie
You look like hammered shit
Don't worry
I've never heard the name noelle hawthorne
Yeah, we might say hi to them on the street
He acted like noelle was a complete stranger
What's to like
I just wanted to introduce myself
I'm gonna fix you up my worldfamous chicken frito pie
It's a nice photo
Could you please not share that with anyone
Marybeth is pissed
It's like you're the goddamn homecoming king
You're right
No, nothing like that
It's not 65inch
Excuse me
Would you please escort miss hawthorne and her children back out to the street
How are you doing
Why would you even ask me that
Ever since you walked into the bar that morning Amy went missing, you seem...   Off
Yeah
I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep
And then, we heard from go
Stage 4 breast cancer
Something to be jettisoned, if necessary
Yeah, I know
I called you a hundred times
Rehearsals
I know this is a bad idea
We need to stop
Stop it
I use the disposable phone
Maybe
I'd have to check my red panty inventory
Never say that out loud again
I just wanna be with you
We moved to Missouri to save Maureen..
So far, it's just costing money
Otherwise, I don't exist
I can't, I'm already late
Do our code
Okay, bye
It would be a new start for us
We could have had this fight four hours ago
"Save"
No, it can't go on like this
You won't
What scared me was how much he wanted to hurt me more
Cross it off the list
Why do you ask
Weed, pills
I told her it's not my thing
Are you sure this is her
That is how crazy I've become
But I'd have to tell them the truth
Oh, shit
Okay
Just get that
Okay
How old is she
How long
You're just like dad
It wasn't like that, okay
Flyover boy
She's not entirely sure
Can you imagine
I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep
Some fucking tragedy groupie
Listen, just because this guy isn't walking around weeping...  That doesn't mean that he's not hurting
Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath is a lack of empathy
I don't deserve this
You got a crush
And, two, don't talk to me that way, ever
So, luminol lit up the kitchen like the 4th of July
It is Amy's, type b, and we should have DNA soon
Trajectory indicates blunt force
Hey Donnie, how are you
Hey
Disappeared three days ago
He is so creepy
She is brilliant...  She's charming, and wise
I love you, Amy
If you need to mock somebody, mock me
Let the police do their jobs
Let's find Amy
Stop him
Guys, come on
All right
Did you know she was pregnant
But it certainly doesn't prove that she's pregnant
You see, we've seen dozens of home invasions
Watch this
No
A lot
No blood and no body suggests kidnapping
Which is what we're doing here, Nick
Gil, what do you and your wife argue about
Money, lack thereof
I don't even golf
We need to find out who did this
Yes, I did
Hold on a sec
For sure
So, my question becomes..
Let me finish
The truth is, Amy didn't want kids
I was trying to put a good face on
You have to fucking talk to me
Masturbate
All right
But you were already with Andie by then, right
A year ago, Amy being pregnant would have been the best thing ever
It was disgusting
Maybe I hate her
Tell you what
I would never ask you that
Why come here
Well, it's incredibly hard
Picture me
Wood
Punish
Because sometimes..
I think...  Man of my dreams...  Father of my child..
Soon to be presumed dead
That's murder
You befriend a local idiot
Craigslist
As if it's so hard to spread your legs
VoilÃ 
Wait for your clueless husband...  To start his day
A lot, a lot
And leave a little something behind
A fire in July
After that, you invent
And Nick thought he was the writer
I'll go out on the water with a handful of pills...  And a pocket full of stones
Nick and Amy will be gone
"Cool girl.
Cool girl is game
She likes what he likes
I ate cold pizza and remained a size two
But I made him smarter
We were the happiest couple we knew
He actually expected me to love him unconditionally
He doesn't get to win
Grownups work for things
Is that all the stuff from the credit cards
Yeah, my woodshed
Let's find out
"Sit back and relax, because you are done.
Fucking crazy bitch
I was gonna ask her for a divorce
She knew I would go to Sawyer beach
She knew exactly what I would do
And by the time you got home...  she was gone
Remember, he beats Judy to death and kills that baby
Hey, neighbor
Nice meeting you
All right
You asshole
So, where are you from
You know, I am an expert oiler
I would hate for y'all to get tan lines
I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet
I got it
And it was in the air, everywhere
And guess what
That is the most disgusting thing I ever heard
I'm sorry
I love it
I'm in
I win the unwinnable cases
I'll give you a special...  "My wife is skilled in the art of vengeance" rate
She's telling a better story
We'll need other voices besides yours
Eight years ago, she pressed charges against him
Exclassmate, desi collings
Apparently
You're gonna want a drink
Fuck, no
Oh, yeah
We click
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's wellread...  She's got an ass like a 20yearold stripper
She annexed me
Gave her some space
No big deal, right
It was rough, but she was screaming for it
Amy has wounds that are consistent with rape
Did you ever see her again
I thought, "there's Amy
Ellen, this is an epidemic
And let me just say this...  Amy would have loved you, and all you do for women
Why don't you tell us about your friend, noelle
What do you mean
Paid the ultimate price
Why was that, noelle
He knew I'd have seen right through him
She was so alone
I'm gonna try and see desi collings on my way home
I'm approved for a second mortgage on the house
Number of times he visited last year
Playing what, Lauren
What the fuck
It's twincest
Can I bum a cigarette
I know you
I got your address from this letter that you wrote my wife
That's a strange question
Let me tell you what Amy told me
Mr. collings
You know how it ends
Why did he go to his dad's house to burn it
You were up his ass with a flashlight
Good night
Elvis is in Missouri
Okay
Decides to teach me a lesson
Which will lead them back to my office..
My father's house
Clue three
Amy would have seen the credit card bill
After the divorce, when dad wasn't coming around..
And be honest
Nick, do you have any idea as to what Andie's mindset is
No, Andie won't do that
Don't take it personally
We need to tell the cops about the woodshed
In all likelihood, she knows that you killed Amy
We find Amy
But where do they start, Nick
Are we keeping score
I'm not sad
I was gonna kill myself
Please put that on a tshirt
I thought you said you were broke
We can expect Nick dunne's arrest any day now
And we have Amy elliott dunne, missing for five days..
Yeah
This is a ticking time bomb
People empathize with that
I will drill you as if you were doing a deposition
A trained monkey
Hey
You clearing out
Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside
Where is the money, sweetheart
Your hair's dyed all hamster
Sorry, but we really need the money
I did not kill my wife
Why don't you try it again
Mr. dunne, from what I understand, you and your wife had some bumps
Let's talk about your mom, how close you were
No
Your "moment" was over 15 months
"I was an idiot
How do you feel
Just like I love this tie
I'm sorry
So, I disappeared
He tracked me from my letters to you
No, I can't turn up now
He should go to prison for what he's done
Excuse me
You're one of the nolan girls, right
Just a second
Hi
No, I had some gummy bears
You little slut
I met Nicholas dunne..
The girl with the giant cumonme tits
That love ended today
Come on, you're staring at ghosts
An hour ago, we were ahead of this
Now
She's going to eat you alive
One, two, three, four, five
Keep it together, you two
At least for the next 24 hours
Therein lies the problem
Roku
Instead of the abc's, he taught her the birds and the bees
Not that I don't appreciate bait shop chic
You'll never get a better sleep
There are cameras everywhere
You are more than safe
You are very safe
Nothing
You were never under my thumb
The sooner you look like yourself, the sooner you'll feel like yourself
I'll be back
Great
I probably am
I am not a murderer
Well, I am desperate to find my missing wife
But I don't care about that anymore
Just because I am not a murderer doesn't make me a good guy
Amy can do that to you
I was this average guy from an average place...  With mediocre aspirations
Instead of doing what was right..
Will you look at that camera for me
You're the best person I've ever known
I will be the man that I promised you I would be
There's more to him than meets the eye
A candor and an honesty that's worthy of respect
I'm Sharon schieber
Fuck
I gave you the benefit of the doubt over and over
Are these the clubs you don't play golf with
Everything just waiting until the wife goes away for good
Desi...  twenty years, you have kept me dangling
Don't trust the instinct that left you beaten and homeless...  Sleeping in your car, fearing for your life
I've been so mistreated for so long
She's not spending another fucking second in there
Without a body, without a murder weapon...  Their only hope is a confession
Yes
Is this your wife's handwriting
Sure
You thought quinoa was a fish
I never touched her
"This man may kill me.
Judy's missing handle
We found this day one, in the fireplace in your home office
So, finally, Nicholas dunne...  You're under arrest for the murder of your wife
I'd love it
Neverending holiday
Nick's idea of culture was a reality TV marathon...  With one hand down his boxers
That's how the kids wear it
Yeah
What does this mean
Come home, Amy
Hello, Mr. collings
Not long
Go slowly
You fucking bitch
Don't you worry, you're gonna have lots of babies
Thank you very much
She's on fairly heavy painkillers
Ms. dunne, I know what you've been through..
I opened the door
Keep him calm
And he clubbed me
I'd just found it
I was holding it when desi pushed in
Back to the woodshed real quick
Now, may I go back to where I was being held prisoner...  By a man with a history of mental problems
And then, he'd punish me
There were cameras everywhere
Please find the tapes
He has a temper
I'm sorry, I feel myself fading
Now, I know there are a lot of questions and concerns..
All right, you can stop pretending now
The Nick I saw on TV, that's the Nick I fell in love with
You need to tell me exactly what happened
You're a murderer
You went on national television and begged for me to save your life
Shampoo
Give it the night
Was there ever a baby
Hello, handsome
He took her
Right now, it's all about our marriage
That's not gonna work
She told you once before
Amy dunne, and the miracle on the Mississippi
Amazing Amy and the humbled husband
You got a book deal, a lifetime movie, you franchised the bar
She had to have made a mistake
The case is with the feds now, they're done
What are you doing
I need more time
Breakfast
We should hold hands
"Amazing"
You have to own this, Nick
I go where the story goes
I'll go find Amy
She's downstairs
That notice of disposal
I have that
I am leaving you
You fucking cunt
You think you would be happy with a nice midwestern girl
You're insane
And then all we did was resent each other, and try to control each other
You could get custody
It's not about what I want anymore
You're breaking my heart
Right
We're partners in crime
How exciting
Perfect
I heard about it this morning
You know how tight the market is
You'll realize that the world does not stop and start at your convenience
We call it a "townstone.
Formal dining is in the back
No scooter
It is in a bit of disarray, but then again, 21foot lot, 53 deep
It’s a very emotional property
There is nothing like this on the market right now
You'll have another family
It would be so lovely if I could show the property before I leave
One at either end
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office
Columbia
His kids are suing each other over the estate
I hardly see how gossip is germane to showing the property
And we emerge in the master suite
What
I've read about these
The alarm goes off in the middle of the night
I think not
Why
No, but I loved her last album
Oh, my god
Open the door, please
This is really dangerous
It couldn't be safer
3000
Mind the pizza
Our first night
But don't
Well, so did I
I forgot to set up that tour of your new school
Oh, yeah
I’ll ride with you
Tell me about it
Mom
Enter.
Go, go back
Come on
Who is that
Raoul has experience
What is this
Videotape
14day escrow
They should not be in for another week
I’m out of here
He's not
They're divorcing
Not with people here
Raoul can totally administrate that part
I’m Raoul
Fuck that
Yeah
It’s not how it's supposed to be
But the fact of the matter is there's still $3,000,000 in this house...  ...and no one but you and l even knows it's here
l've got the mother
Sarah
ln the house
I told you
The panic room
Shit
Fuck
Damn it
Oh, damn
What do you think they want
What if they get in here
Yeah
Chills
He's got kids
She could be in there calling the cops
She would've had to do it through Manhattan Security, my company
She couldn't have
The police are on their way
I’m just scaring her
Take what you want and get out
Hey, Zorro
What is he doing
No, no
Let’s not tell her anything
"Get the fuck out of my house.
Okay, I have an idea
Conversation's over
Like that'll help you think
She said it again, that she called the cops
How do we get into that room
Now, how do we get in
But when she does, she can't get out of this house
And why would they come out in the first place
Small space
I guess it used to happen all the time
What are they doing now
This is not happening
No, you're not
This is what I do
Call the police
Do you hear us
What do you got, MacGyver
Listen, goddamn it
We're going to be fine
I just did
Don't be stupid
Quiet
Mom
Cut it back a little
We can't get in if they're dead
Keep it down
Turn it down
Oh, my god
There are people trying to sleep over there
Shit
Are you okay
Yeah
What
Downstairs
Get up
The first thing I’m going to do this morning is call my plastic surgeon
Okay
Get control of your goddamn expert
I’m letting you know he's a problem
None of this was your idea
Yes
We're over here
I’m the loving grandson who put in the time with the old man...  ...every goddamn weekend for two years...  ...talking to him, dressing him, walking him, feeding him
The bedroom's empty
Two of them, on the stairs
Christ
You're a bus driver, Raoul
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard bullshit you just heard...  ...because I saw that movie, too
She got something
No
No signal
I can't go to prison, man
Phillips
Shit
Here
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street..
God
Hello
Move
There are three men upstairs
No
Just in case we needed each other
He won't
What
This is worse than impossible
This is unpleasant
That's excellent
We got to stay calm, okay
All right
There's no way we're getting into that room
I just got to be honest with myself here
I’ll inherit
Fuck, I’ll still put away 8 or 9 hundred grand and keep my goddamn hair
When
I'm out of here
Wait a minute
Plus, you named eight people you got to split it with...  ...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks in the safe
Fine
It doesn't matter now
Did you think that l'd open that safe...  ...and then me and Raoul would wait while you picked out your share
Your eyes were huge when I told you about the gig...  ...so don't play innocent
Mints
You leave, you get nothing
Later, Raoul
Sarah, listen to me:  Go to the corner
Don't move
Come on
Fucking asshole
Who's got the gun
What did she say
Did you call anybody else
No
Yeah, you can
You want me to just make something up
This is ridiculous
Maybe
...Yesterday and Today, Magical Mystery Tour, The White Album....  Stay warm, baby
pepper....  Oh, god
Open the door
All right
Lie down
Get your hands off him, you frightening hillbilly motherfucker
Get the fuck off him, now
All right, turn around
What happened to her
What are you doing
Get her, get her
Where's your gun
Open the door
She's got your gun
I know you've got the gun
Or I swear to God, I’ll kill you both
So give her the shot yourself
What happens if you don't get it
Shit
You fucking bitch
Do you understand
All I know about this is what I see on TV
Yeah, okay
Your mom's rich
He had it all worked out
I gave her the shot
She's all right
Come on, raise your arm
Just do everything they ask
The police
You scared the shit out of me
All right, take this
She's going to handle it
What are you.... What time is it
What do you want
Ma'am, you don't look so good
That you said, "There are three" right before you got cut off
Look....  My husband and I just split up...  ...and it's my first night in a new house...  ...and I admit I was a little drunk
And the sentence, if you insist on knowing...  ...was going to be:  "There are three things that I’ll do for you if you come jump into bed with me.
That's something you could do safely
I’m fine
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am
You're here with me
What's up
Who told you to bring a gun
One second
Let's get out of here
Leave that
Come on
You don't want to do that
Okay
Just let her go
Put that gun down
Just let her go
No
Stephan, shoot him
Everybody on the ground
Freeze
I will kill you
Central, I need a bus at 38 West 94th
Open your hands
Dad, it's okay
"Bank foreclosure, must sell, luxury doorman building, health club...   "...conserg..."  Concierge
mean
I like the sound of that one
A crime of passion
TAYLOR: Yeah, well, this is a done deal
We are all gonna be real glad when we get rid of you, Somerset, you know that
Anything else has nothing to do with us
MILLS: Lieutenant, l apologize for interrupting like this
I thought we might find a bar somepIace
I don't follow
I guess for the same reasons as you
I thought l could do some good
..if we didn't start out kicking each other in the balls
If you're calling the shots, lieutenant Yes
MAN 1 : Hey, hey
HelIo
Serpico's gotta go
Good
SOMERSET: What time was death established
No one bothers with vital signs
But this guy's been sitting in a piIe of his own piss and shit
What exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into
Oof
No one
Guy dead on the ground
Fuck
MILLS: Wait a minute
Oh, God
Are you thinking it's poison
Hi, how are you
Send in Forensics on your way out, please
You seen the things l've done
And
Don't jerk me off
And l can tell you, it was not from poison
SANTIAGO: Now, Iook at this
Here
And the interior wall is ripped open
What about these bruises up here
Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a homicide
SOMERSET: Killer put a bucket beneath him, kept on serving
That's when the killer kicked him and he burst
Simple as that
So
I've been out in the rain all day
MILLS: What
Six more days and you're all the way gone
This should not be his first assignment
Captain It's too soon for you
Look, I don't have anyone eIse to put on this and you know it
MILLS: Give it to me
Give it to me
Quiet down
Quiet down

.. l'm on my way out here
MAN 3: Nothing yet, boss
<i>Hold on.</i> REPORTER 3: It's rumored you're far...  <i>...from apprehending a suspect.</i> <i>TALBOT: I've come from a meeting...</i>  <i>...of law enforcement officials</i> <i>and they've assured me...</i>  <i>...they have their very best men on this.</i>  <i>This will be the very definition</i> <i>of swift justice.</i>  CAPTAIN: Pardon me, George
SOMERSET: Nope, haven't heard
Greed
Could you not do that, please
You're not gonna be a cop anymore
I don't think you're leaving

I don't understand this place any longer
You were made for it and l don't think you can deny that
They were, uh

<i>Paradise Lost.</i>  All right, I'm confused
This was found behind the same refrigerator
Hold on
I can't get involved in this
Where you headed
SOMERSET: Thanks, George
Duty calls
All these books
MAN 3: Hey, we got culture
How's this for culture
Fucking Dante
Good work, officer
You go ahead
MilIs
Are you okay, something wrong
<i>Come on.</i>  Okay
<i>Thank you
Oh, uh
I accepted
Hi, idiot
Except, of course, your first name
David, this is William
Good, they're in the room
Uh
I mean, thank you
You'll have to excuse all this mess
You know, we're stilI unpacking
He was the funniest guy l'd ever met
WeIl, it's kind of rare nowadays, you know
I was close once

Very true
You know, takes time, settle in
It will go away in a minute

Sorry, honey
We found out the first night
I don't know why you're laughing
He was the biggest defense lawyer in town

..laid low till the cleaning crew left then had his way with Gould all day Saturday
He was handed a butcher's knife
Of course
..to sit and decide which cut to make first
Even though the corpse is there, look through it
Trick is to find one item, one detail and focus on it...  
The sins were used in medieval sermons

You read them

Forced what
Oh, like because someone's sticking a fucking gun in your face
Which l don't get
Because the fucker had to get back out
Thank you for talking this out, but I gotta sleep
WaIk the dogs
So this means she saw something
But something she's supposed to see, but hasn't been given a chance
Gotta see Mrs. Gould
Mrs. Gould, l am sorry
I don't see anything
Please, l just I can't do this right now
You sure your men didn't move this
Nothing
Goddamn it
Yeah
Now Somerset's climbing on the furniture
Honestly, have you ever seen anything like this
MILLS: Who knows
My dog made me do it
About catching this guy
Why don't you tell me what the hell it is you think we're doing then
That's all
Saving them in case we get rescued
You've got a winner
His prints were found at the scene by Homicide
Now, Victor dabbled in drugs, armed robbery and assault
We're gonna finish this thing up today, ladies and germs
Never in my 34 years, knock wood
You
We were a secondary unit
Spun him like a top
Well, he died right there
OFFlCER 1 : All rise
SWAT goes before dicks
Clear
OFFlCER 2: CIear
Dicks, you'll wanna come take a look at this
MILLS: What the hell
California, get your peopIe out
CALlFORNIA: Go on now
Goddamn
I got a hair sample, l got a stool sample, I got piss, I got fingernails
Coming through
No shit
Hey, man, l feed off my emotions
I got a right to be here
Get out
I got your picture, man
MAN: I'm surprised you can spell
Hey, man, l'm sorry, I 
It's impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions
Even an antibiotic.. 
Even if his brain were not mush, which it is

He's experienced about as much pain and suffering as anyone l've encountered
<i>It's Tracy.</i> Tracy
<i>TRACY: He's just, uh</i>  <i>He's in the other room.</i> <i>He's in the shower.</i>  <i>Um, l'm sorry to call you like this.</i>  Oh, it's all right
Do you think you could meet me somewhere...  
..you're the only person that I know here
Why don't you talk to him about it
You know, l can't be a burden
You know
Uh, he mentioned it
But the conditions here are horrible
Oh, Tracy, I 

I had a relationship once
Just another day like any other, except it was the first day after l knew about
I told her l didn't want to have it
..  


If you don't keep

..don't ever tell him that you were pregnant
William
Thank you
Heh
This is the job
Come on, he's insane
I don't think so
We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he tied Victor to the bed
Oh, yes, we do
He's right, so far
I got like 50
At the top we'll put Purgatory, <i>Canterbury Tales.</i>  Anything relating to the seven deadly sins
what would he study to do the things he's done
Could you at least sit across from me
Fuck
It's not a problem
About an hour
Yeah
Who, stinky man
What
Anyone who checks out a flagged book
You  You can't use the information directly
If you wanna know who's reading <i>Purgatory and Paradise Lost...</i>  <i>...and Helter Skelter,</i> the FBl's computers wiIl tell us
It could
How do you know all this
Bondage?</i>  Not what you think
There it is
Is that it
You saw it, John Doe
MILLS: This is crazy
You do the talking
Mills
No
Mommy
Aah
Aah
Shut the fuck up
Mills
SOMERSET: Where are you going
Wait
How did we get here
Will you listen to me
All right, all right, I'm sorry
We need a reason to knock on this door
Okay, man
When you're right, you're right
You stupid son of a....  How much money we got left
I told you the rest
Have her sign
Okay
Victor
Somerset
We had him and we let him go
Yup
Let me show you something
MILLS: Yes
Hey, man, l'm doing the best I can
There are 2000 notebooks on these shelves
What fun we have dancing and fucking
I tried to be pleasant and accommodating
Placed on the shelves in no discernible order
I know, l know, I know
Phone
<i>I don't know how you found me,</i> <i>but imagine my surprise.</i>  <i>I respect you law enforcement agents</i> <i>more every day.</i>  Well, I appreciate that, John
Ugh, he's preaching
Looks like a pro
MILLS: Last night
I've got a picture of it
One sweet piece, actually
I think l undercharged him, actually
Fucking pigs
Can you do something about this music
You from Homicide
OFFlCER: Hey, easy
MILLS: Get him out of here, now
No
The girl, the prostitute
Someone comes to your establishment
Yeah
Some guys are carrying suitcases full of stuff
But that's Iife, isn't it
And he made me wear it
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth
The fucking gun was in my throat
You know
These:   If you think you're preparing me for hard times, thank you, but...
They wanna eat cheeseburgers, play lotto and watch TV
It wasn't one thing, I can tell you that

I'm not

No
You can't afford to be this naive
It makes no sense
And you're gonna make a difference
Whatever, the point is, is that l don't think you're quitting
I think you wanna believe them because you're quitting
I don't agree with you
Thank you, though
MAN: 911 , what's your emergency

But you'll be disfigured
To spite her face
You'd be doing me a favor
MILLS: You knew I'd say yes
After this, l'm gone
On the fucking floor
Now
Faster
What the fuck is this
Goddamn it
No credit history
About only thing we know about that guy right now
..is that he's independently wealthy, welIeducated and totally insane
MILLS: What
It's not supposed to make any sense
MILLS: Ugh, so, what the fuck, man
Two more victims hidden away


He's gonna get his free room and board, get his free cable TV
No
I am required by law to serve my clients
Aw, Jesus
I'd like to see him try
He says that if you do accept under his specific conditions...  
It's your case
If he were to claim insanity, this conversation is admissible

We're not just going to pick up two more dead bodies, are we, John

Yeah
It's not something l would expect you to accept
I don't doubt that you believe that, John
If you were chosen...  
I doubt I enjoyed it any more than Detective MilIs
..would enjoy time alone with me in a room without windows
Nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work
ls that supposed to be funny
If you saw him, you'd point him out to your friends so they'd join you in mocking him
Murderers

Okay
Off you go

MILLS: Hmm
Here he comes
What
I'm trying to tell you how much I admire you and your pretty wife
It's disturbing how easily a member of the press can purchase information
...  After you'd left
I tried to play husband
What's he talking about
Put the, ugh Put the gun down
Not until you give me the gun
You're a fucking liar, shut up

And they prayed God would keep him out of harm's way
They buried him in the family plot,  where he would be with them when their time came
Papa said there were people everywhere
Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™ve offended anybody
I hope you enjoy my clock
I hope I haven't disappointed you
There's a diary
Is this what you want to do
Okay
Benjamin Button.
The First World War had ended,  and Iâ€™ve been told it was an especially good night to be born
That's enough
Yeah
She gave her life for me
What do you have there
Come on, now, you know I ain't got nothing but work to do around here
The air is sweet
You ain't no slouch yourself
Sweeter than I should've been
Okay, Queenie'll be right there
Oh, the Lord done something here
Poor baby
Queenie
No, go, Iâ€™ll be back
Youâ€™ll be messing yourself soon enough
Okay
They're right here, Mrs. Hollister
Now, come on
You just want to avoid any undue stimulation

He shows all the deterioration, the infirmities, not of a newborn,  but of a man well in his 80s on his way to the grave
She had an unfortunate adventure
A baby
Queenie, some creatures aren't meant to survive
Just not the kind of miracle one hopes to see

There's not a baby I can't care for
Dr. Rose said he ain't got much more time on this earth
I know you ain't got all the parts it takes to make one of your own,  but this ain't yours to keep
You never know what's coming for you
You have such a lovely voice
Stop banging that fork

Or around the next corner

But we're all going the same way
How much longer I got
I felt safe

Come on
He's gonna see that you walk from faith
Hallelujah
Yes
Don't touch him
I said, rise up
Walk on
That's right, Benjamin
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow..

You're different than anybody Iâ€™ve ever met
You come right out here and get back up to bed
You're too young to be wandering around in the night on your own
God hasn't said yet, baby
Once when I was repairing a leak on the roof

Not many people experience that
A lot of folks been through that old house
Where
Iâ€™m moving in today
Iâ€™m sorry, but we usually don't allow dogs in the house
Right this way, ma'am
I do remember she wore diamonds
Although she never did and nobody ever came to visit her
I felt pretty good, considering
Look at this eye
Have you had a chance to say your goodbyes
Yeah
You busy
"Queenie would let me go with Mr. Daws
Anybody want to make $2 for a day's work 'round here
Nobody wants to do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay
Well, that's good enough for me
I would do anything
He'd been on a tugboat since he was seven
I do every morning
Never
Well, then, by Jesus, you are coming with me
All fathers want to do is hold you down
"Tug Irish," they called him
He says, "Who the hell do you think you are
God meant for you to work a tugboat, just like me
When Iâ€™m dead, Iâ€™m gonna send him my arm
Don't let anyone telic you different

Hi
How are you tonight, grandpa
Thank you
It sure made me understand the value of earning a living
Itâ€™s nasty out

Well, it's an experience
There's a time for everything
Well, I was born with some form of disease
My wife passed away many years ago
To children
Our biggest competition is B. F. Goodrich  and his infernal zippers
I enjoyed talking to you
Anytime
Growing up's a funny thing
Come on
Okay
Can you swim
Here, put this on
Sunday
Is that a girl
I could lose my license
I wish we could go with them
I don't know how it's possible, but you seem to have more hair
Itâ€™s an awful responsibility
You want to go with me to the drugstore
I had gone to a brothel
Bye, Mr. Benjamin
Thank you
Benjamin
Can you imagine
Liverpool
We were a crew of seven now
There was John Grimm, who sure fit his name
And Pleasant Curtis from Asheville, Notch
But I was relegated to the corps
Benjamin
The hummingbird is not just another bird
Their wingtips are doing that
They were drunk every single night
Thank you very much
She was not beautiful
He was Chief Minister of the British Trade Mission in Murmansk,  and he was a spy
Key, darling
And even longer nights
Thank you
A bit of honey, please
Well, quite right
I hope you won't think me impolite, but I have to ask,  aren't you a little old to be working on a boat
I usually sleep like a baby
Die in his sleep
Good God
New Orleans
And we talked till just before the dawn
A hotel in the middle of the night can be a magical place
Beg pardon
Murmansk
What does a girl know about love

Savor it
And you've never had caviar before, have you
But the current that day was so strong that,  for every stroke I took, I was pushed back two
But I never did
It was the first time a woman had ever kissed me
I think you make me feel younger
Do something
You never get it back
Those are the rules
How thoughtless of me
But each time seemed new and different
Come here
There's been a change of plan, lads
Once you set foot on that boat, you're in the Navy, friend
Right after inadequate safety equipment
What the hell
We're going to war, gentlemen
It wasn't the war any of us expected

His name was Dennis Smith, and he was a fullblooded Cherokee
Iâ€™ve been watching you
All hands on deck
All stop
Sub
Thank you, Chief
Give me your other hand
You could swear, curse the Fates
I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money
Out here, death didn't seem natural
Iâ€™m ready
Yes
Who's that, Mama
Come here, wash your hands, help me with the table
I think that preacher laid hands on you gave you a second life
Well, you learn anything worth repeating
Sure
Yeah, that's what I want to hear
Yeah, well, it's only one or two of them left now
Iâ€™m so glad you're back home with me
You're wasting your time, baby
Looks the same, smells the same, feels the same
Thank you
Benjamin
There's so much I want to know
You stopped writing
"When I had left, she was a girl
I heard that
Do you know about Edgar Cayce, the psychic

What about you
Is it as cold as they say
But I think you really are
Oh, he's a famous choreographer
You know, in a rehearsal once, a dancer fell
Itâ€™s called "abstract.
She's just torn up all those conventions,  you know, ail that straightupanddown stuff
Oh, my God
There's always something to do
I can imagine dancing completely naked
Have you read D. H 
In our company, we have to trust each other
Which part
We could lay down your jacket
You're going back to New York in the morning
Our lives are defined by opportunities
Even the ones we miss

.
While everybody else was aging, I was getting younger, all alone
Darn foot
Creature of habit
We employed 1 0 times the number of people
You know,  Iâ€™m sick
Iâ€™m sorry to hear that, Mr. Button
Benjamin, do you know anything about buttons
After the Civil War, he moved to New Orleans,  where my father had the wisdom to make our own buttons
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Button
Your mother died giving birth to you
It was as if I was the only one alive
Iâ€™d find excuses to go down to that kitchen  just so I could look at her
April 25th, 1918
And what does he think, anyway
Everybody's just supposed to be friends
Good night, Mama
But you know what
Thank you
Heâ€™ll be buried right next to your mother
You're my mother
We need the wardrobe
Hi
Oh, well, I wish you would've called
Thank you, they're lovely
I better get changed

She's divine
This is Benjamin
All right
Hey, excuse me
Lord, Benjamin
You going downtown
Youâ€™ll have a good time
Be right there
I think so
He came to telic me his father had died

For five years, l. 
You never talked about your dancing
And Iâ€™d find myself saying...  Good night, Benjamin
Letter for Mr. Benjamin Button
Sometimes we're on a collision course and we just don't know it
But she had forgotten her coat, went back to get it
And this cab driver, who dropped off the earlier fare  and had stopped to get the cup of coffee,  he picked up the lady who was going shopping  and had missed getting the earlier cab
All the while, Daisy was getting dressed
Daisy
And her leg was crushed
You'd do the same for me
I don't want you to see me like this
Iâ€™m not going back to New Orleans
Tried to telic you that in New York
We are not little children anymore, Benjamin
I couldn't have him see me like that
Oh, darling, could you get the nurse
She is gonna struggle to breathe
I read that already
I can't lie
I did enjoy the company of a woman or two
How come you didn't write or nothing
Good night, Mama
Y'all have fun
We sailed into the Gulf along the Florida Keys
I bet you can't
Both of them
Will you still love me when my skin grows old and saggy
Well, I was thinking how nothing lasts
And what a shame that is
Mama
Where is everybody
Our deepest condolences
And so we might have memories of our own,  we sold my father's house on Esplanade
You have to see the master suite

We didn't have a stick of furniture
You know, you might've got a few more years out of it,  but you chose to do something so special and unique  that there was only a short window of time you could do it
I just don't like getting old
Come back the other way
Good night
The line of your body
We finally caught up with each other
Okay
Then I will love it all the more
I am gonna make this work
Here you go
I have to go pee
...having made the swim in 34 hours,  22 minutes and 1 4 seconds
You ready
Thank you all
Operator, I need an ambulance
Push
Everyone's fine
And this is how you telic me
...because all the ingredients are there for a major storm,  possibly even up to a Category 5
What are you talking about
Is it me
It was your first birthday
The house was filled with children
"I left with just the clothes on my back.
"Happy Birthday
Five
"I wish I could have been your father

There are no rules to this thing
I hope you feel things you never felt before
And if you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength  to start all over again
Iâ€™m sorry, we're closing
Why did you come back
You knew him when you were just a baby
Oh, this is a friend of my family's
Bye
Iâ€™m just locking up
But then, who isn't at 1 2

He's an incredibly kind, just bright, adventurous man
So, where are you staying

I remember that

We're staying
Nothing lasts
Some things you never forget
Sometime after your father passed,  there was a call
Come on in
He's in very poor health
He was taken to the hospital
Benjamin
Would you mind if I sit with you
And every day,  I would stop by to make sure that he was comfortable
You're all fucking liars
I have a feeling there's a lot of things I can't remember
Many times, he would simply forget who or where he was
I want you to come down
He was five when I moved in
What's my name
And then he closed his eyes as if to go to sleep
We're expecting flash flooding after the levee break
Some are artists
<i><b>http://t3ll4v1s10nddl.blogspot.com</b></i>  Some are mothers
Have a nice day
I mean, you may be perched on majority shares,  but we all get fucked if the actuals crash

You know what that is
Just...  Tell me you'll call

I didn't mean it the way it sounded
And it was the best thing that ever happened to me
I said I'll call, okay
Someone's got to fly to Seattle and drive a stake through Anson's heart
We're furious
How is he
He's okay

Why do I call
We did the ultrasound
Well, it's good to talk with you

The bill which attaches a smallbusiness health plan  to those of larger corporations  is receiving initial support from a number of key Republican leaders
Well, you shouldn't feel this reflects negatively on you
I took these tests in good faith
Jim Feingold, VP Engineering, Data Analysis
I don't know exactly how this works
I got an office around here somewhere
New Moon Cafe
What is
You sure you're not hungry
A MNPI and a PAP
We'll run our TRW
What is this for
Except you don't go to it,  it comes to you
We provide  whatever's lacking
You really think that I'll participate without knowing any...  First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing
You can drop out at any time with no further obligation
It's a cursory examination,  turnyourhead, cough sort of thing
Mr. Sutherland called about BaerGrant Publishing
How much longer is this going to take
We're almost done
Please make a selection for the following emotional responses
Does this thing end
It states that you're aware  that the game exists, that you're a willing participant in said game,  so on and so forth
We've never had an unsatisfied customer
And I'll... Keep the pen
We'll let you know
By the way, I went to CRS
Are you gonna do this
No, they haven't, actually
See
Believe so, sir
Speaking about games...  Couldn't help but overhear you talking about CRS
No, not yet
The eternal question
Hmm, if you'll excuse me, I got to go
Oh, about a year ago
What it's all about
Goodnight
When Mr. Van Orton boards his plane on the morrow  he will have every agreement and addendum in the complete closing package  flawlessly revised
How did you get this number
Oh, this is ridiculous
Thank you for thinking of CRS
Leave a message
Meanwhile, Republican leaders argue that this passage  would be the very stimulant that a sluggish economy needs
In other financial news, stock markets rose both domestically and abroad today  after the announcement of stronger than expected earnings  by several high tech companies  but dipped again reacting to reports that Nicholas Van Orton had sneezed
Are you gonna spend the rest of the evening prying at that clown's mouth
You'll never know where you'll find them or how you'll need to use them
Let us save the questions till afterwards
You know how dangerous that is
Is everything all right
I've finished for the evening
Good night
Cold
Write this number down
Good luck and congratulations on choosing CRS
Help me out here, huh
I need some toilet paper
Come on, help me out
I wanted to wish you luck
No, I'll be fine
All of these years,  the first time ever you've stepped foot in these offices,  it's to ask me to step down
Admittedly, yes
Will you really hold me to it over pennies
Give me...  Give me next quarter
Because you went fishing with my father I should sit on my hands  while you're throwing my money away
Action is taken
There's no BaerGrant Publishing...  No BaerGrant Publishing without Anson Baer
Valid until this evening
I could fight you on this
Excuse me
I wasn't even looking
Just get me some napkins and some soda water
Looks like the, uh,  cleaning bill's gonna be more than the suit
Asshole
What do you want me to do
You heard me
Fucking lamb vichyssoise, you little...  Miss
I, uh..
Now it looks like I'm going on unemployment
I'm apologizing
I don't know, he just..
Get help
Is that real enough for you
Oh, good God
Detain me
The hospital
This is insane
Yes
Hang on
It's a company
This is a..
Why're they involving you
I gave him mouthtomouth
You'd better hide
Never mind
Why not
We'll wait for help, so...  Let's just wait for help
Come on, step up
I'm not wearing any underwear
Thank you
I'll wait
This is the company I was telling you about
They'll love that
Are you trying to ditch me
I'm going
Here
Stupid fucking dogs
Here you go
Watch out for nails  and rats
I think  if we  drop from here,  the garbage will break our fall
What the fuck are you looking at
Yeah
How are you doing
That would be great
No, I'm an investment banker
Is there a towel I could use
I overreacted

No, I don't think so
Thank you, sir
What are you talking about

That's really cute
Who hired you
Mr. Van Orton... Maria, get hold of Sutherland
The only thing they care about is the stock
It's all right, dear
I'm not finished
You were right
You know, sailing
It was a misunderstanding
What do you know
I don't believe it
This is what I'm dealing with
Okay
Maria, the other night, last night  I got a taxi for a young woman named Christine
Oh, shit
I have a gun
Are you all right
There's been a break in
911 emergency
Now sir, you said it was a break in
Are you sure there's not still someone somewhere in the house
Meet me at your car
Just wait
CRS
And just when you think it's all over that's when the real fucking starts
They won't leave me alone
What're they doing to you
I paid them more to make it stop
We'll figure it out
I can't get a signal
Hit the Teletrack
Whose are these
You're behind the whole thing, aren't you
Why would I ever do what you're describing
It kills you that I'm living my life
I'm calling the cops
I'm sorry I didn't live up to your expectations
I don't wanna be you
Always pushing the responsibility out on me
No
Nobody asked you to play dad

It's this way
Management for the building says this space hasn't been officially rented yet
No
It's all pending
Illegal surveillance
Now, look
What was my father like, Ilsa
You could spend time in a room  and not even know that he'd been there the whole time
Not much, I think
Yes
Amy, who is it
Can we talk
Hi
Was in my hotel room
Well, the..
Is it this contest thing that you're in still or..
We can talk
That's first communion
What's wrong
What
We'll go for a drink
Come on out of there
So, what are they going to do
Get out of the car
And they find me now they...  Get out of the goddamn car
I don't know
I'm an employee
Sorry
Same thing to him they did to you
You gave them everything else
Alamein Bank, Zurich, Switzerland
Can I have your code, please
That's impossible
They got everything
They're trying to kill me
They..
Never mind
You should be glad you're alive
Con games, how many
Yes
I was disturbed to say the least
Who is it
My attorney says that nothing is missing
Sutherland's in on it
What do you mean
B of A, France, Switzerland, you were talking to us
Filled in the blanks
It's complicated
I..
I don't speak Spanish
As far as money is concerned, can I make a suggestion
Excuse me
I need a ride
Could you ring his room, please
Will you come with me, sir
We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior
A nervous breakdown, they said
I mean...  Look at you
What happened, I..
I need your car
And whatever else happens before he speaks..
Yeah, I opened it
I'm sorry, Liz
I'm sorry
You've been on the go for days
There's nothing to forgive
Taggarene

He'd really be perfect for this part
Lionel Fisher, I love your work
Look, I, uh..
Snack time
I mean, it's what I'm good at..
Damn it, why do they do that
And you work for them, right
You got to speak to someone
Right now  I am  extremely  dangerous
Come on, we're leaving
He's eyeing us like Tiffany Towers
Stay down
Shut up
Cuff him to the rail
I told you they hired me over the phone...  Where did you pick up your checks
I don't know
What are you doing here
All right, what do you think you're doing
Why
Get on that radio, all right
Who am I gonna call, Nicholas
They'll let me die
What
The guard had an automatic
We got a real goddamn gun up here...  Nicholas, it's fake
Bullshit
They shot that guy, Feingold, Fisher, they killed him
No, what'd you really really see, this whole time
Feingold, Mr. Fisher
You're trying to kill me
My house,  they shot at us with blanks
They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne
Let me show you
Don't you move
Someone call an ambulance
You never,  never let the mark take over
We're all going to jail for the rest of our lives
We have him here
Mr. Van Orton, don't open your eyes
Just take it easy
My brother, Nicholas Van Orton
Thank God you jumped
Sweet dreams
Thanks, Mel, for coming
I'll call you
It was a great entrance
This is  the bill
You wanna split it
Oh, my God
Christine

What is this
Mikael, can we get a quote
He's a fine journalist...</i>  <i>...who I don't believe is guided by malice.</i>  <i>But what he wrote was inaccurate.</i>  <i>And inaccuracies can't go unanswered.</i>  <i>All journalists have to accept, like the rest of us...</i>  <i>...actions have consequences.</i>  <i>Blomkvist was ordered to pay...</i>  <i>...600,000 Swedish kronor in damages and all court costs.</i>  Can I get a packet of Marlboro Red and a lighter
Walking
Just one
I'm as much to blame
Not the same
I'll call Greger, tell him I'm not coming home
I'm afraid that doesn't mean much
I'm concerned you won't like her
How do you do
No, it was quite thorough
You mean he's hygienic
True
Are you suggesting that he was set up
Moment
Anything you chose not to disclose
...I might find unsavory, even if she doesn't
You needed a better attorney
As she hoped
Dad
About me
Are you serious
Light of what
Forgive me for intruding on Christmas.</i>  <i>My name is Dirch Frode.</i>  I'm an attorney
Yeah, of course I have
Up north
Okay
Usually when I wake up in a cold bed it's at home
Stepping aside
It's lovely in the spring
Unless we get snowed in
So...  ...what do you know about me
Oh, I didn't mean that
I'm not obsessed by the declining health of the company
Officially, assisting with my memoirs
You will be investigating thieves, misers, bullies...  ...the most detestable collection of people that you will ever meet
I could possibly clear a place if necessary
Oh, the 4:30
Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940
They still call them that
Anyway, he died in 1965
His wife, Isabella, who had been pretty much useless as a parent before...  ...became even more so after his death...  ...which is when I began looking after the children
Yeah
<i>She came into the parlor
Why didn't I listen
The firemen stayed out all night...  <i>...on the bridge pumping up gasoline.</i>  <i>No one swam across or took a boat.</i>  All the boats were still tied up on this side Sunday
Anything that falls in the water turns up
His body didn't drift more than 10 meters...  ...when he drowned the year before
<i>After the police investigation evaporated...</i>  <i>...I kept at it, studying all the information there was.</i>  I have spent half my life examining the events of a single day
We don't need to
You have a very keen investigative mind
What you're asking me to do is set aside my life and career for  Think of this as a welldeserved holiday  A way of avoiding all those people that you might want to avoid right now
He began his career working for me...  ...and I have followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since
You fired me
I'm running away
There is a problem between us
It's four hours by train
<i>Network busy
His ward
The caretaker
Well, I'm doing a biography of Herr Vanger
I saw you on television
Cost you a lot of money though, yeah
Oh, yes, he's quite detestable, to put it nicely
They don't speak
You, probably
How you'll wish it were always so
Someone's shooting his dinner
And you live there
Yes, you're right
Please
Did she know something someone wished she didn't
She was with some friends that day at a parade
She left early
She received that from Henrik the Christmas before
The first belonged to a woman, Margot...  ...whose mother was Magda, who denied knowing Harriet
It's my Rebecka case
Back then we had an Officer Torstensson
I'm talking about the soul of a policeman
Make coffee, sort mail
Enough
And when was the last time you were late
Here's the problem
And you failed to adapt to four foster homes...  ...were arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics...  ...again for assault, smashing a bottle into a man's face
Starting now, you will be given a monthly allowance
The state has taken care of you
I'm Liv
Oh, good, thank you
Thank you, Martin
No, no
What are we drinking
A dark day
Do you like this wine...  ...or you want to try something else
Together they are the old Sweden and the new
You don't
What can't
That's one reason
Not just the family but the company as well
At our height we had 40,000 employees
I know it well
Hi
Oh, yes
We are all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family
So you're not really here to find out what happened to Harriet
Those weren't Henrik's investigation
He couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager
Where is she
We never really got along
She hates this place more than I do
If you do, and try talking to her about us...  ...don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck oh'
It's a health matter
And you will
Can you do that
Unzip it
It's almost convincing
Please have a seat
How do you do
Actually it's a lot more than that
I've gotten up to the 1960s...  ...to the event that, you know, changed everything in Henrik's life
I'm not really speaking about the event itself
Drunken father
Not that I ever saw, but you could tell that something was going on
And then she'd be studying her Bible like a nun
You don't have any thoughts about who or why
And she'd have done the same
I'm sorry I missed our appointment, I had a lot of work
<i>It's...</i>  <i> Hello
You like it
How are you
You're so cute when you're surly
Are you sure
Are you sure
We still own one
Well, we've never had to consider it before
We don't care about content
I gathered that
The enemies of my friends are my enemies
I deserve to be treated like an idiot
Well, I'm saying it now
We're not marrying into it
Mikael
So
This is really gonna hurt
He's a titan and a gentleman.</i>  <i>But he's also quite old now...</i>  <i>...which may explain how he could be taken in by a convicted liar.</i>  Threetwenty
You're too young to know about that
I need some money
You're alive
It's not a snap
I thought it was going to be another blow job...  ...which is disgusting enough
Each month you will prepare a report of a meeting we will never have
In it, you'll describe how well I'm doing
Nod that you understand
Do you doubt anything I've said
No, it's okay, you can nod because it's true
And there will be blood
What are you doing here
I'm not dangerous
I haven't been around enough to really know what's going on with you
But I'd never want you not to tell me something...  ...because you think I might not want to hear it
Thanks
<i>I love you.</i>  <i>A woman who is a medium or a sorcerer...</i>  <i>...shall be put to death by stoning.</i>  <i>If a dove is the sinner's offering...</i>  <i>...the priest shall wring off its head, cleave its wings...</i>  <i>...and burn it upon the altar.</i>   Hello
<i>Yes, hello
Rebecka Jacobsson.</i>  <i>And how was she killed?</i>  She was decapitated
Think he's gonna be okay
I'm sorry
You want a sandwich
Wennerström
Well, that is indelicate
But we both know that nothing's going to come of this, don't we
You're joking
The last time I reported on something without being absolutely sure..
She did the background check on you
Herr Frode was kind enough to share your report with me
It's against policy
Here's a name for you
There are things in here that can only have come from one place
She's had a rough life
May I come in
Who do you think you are
Okay
It's okay
But for me, it wasn't very entertaining
Your boss, Armansky...  ...yeah, he tells me you only do jobs that interest you...  ...so I suppose I should be flattered
He also says that you're the one he goes to when the job is sensitive
Lisbeth Oh, can I call you Lisbeth
I've got absolutely no idea...  ...who the rest of these are or how they're connected...  ...to the death of a 16yearold girl, but they must be somehow
Getting started
Why would a lady like you want to know about an awful murder
Once you get to strangers, it's only a matter of time...  ...before you get to gypsies and you know you're never going to solve it
I have a high metabolism
I'm asking because it is better to look at what I am about to show you...  ...on an empty stomach
So how was it with Miss Salander
Don't check
Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik
This is the last thing he needs
Thanks
It has nothing to do with you
You're the last chance Henrik has at some kind of resolution
Of course
Thank you so much
Good night
I can make you a sandwich
Three I'm sure of
Okay
A cleaning woman and parttime palm reader
I usually like to smoke outside
Leviticus 21:9
Leviticus 20:16
Lea Persson, 1962
Next, Eva Gustavsson, 1960
A student
Torture
Religion
Rebecka, Sara, all from the Old Testament
Oh, yeah, there might be a cat somewhere
Isn't what
They're encrypted
It's too bad you don't have hers
Can I
That's the one
Okay
That's "Norsjö," yeah
I don't even know if he worked there or not...  ...but if he did, maybe he used to come in here for hardware
I'm no detective, but 1966, I would have started at a retirement home
<i>Please drive to highlighted route.</i>  In 1966, you were in Hedestad with your husband
It wouldn't be a miracle
See, that's you there
How awful
Which one are you
It felt perfunctory, like your heart wasn't in it
Or I'll do it again...  ...right here
Couldn't we just use tape or something
Okay
It's my eye
Madness
Fuck
This is insane
Yeah, well, I do have some standards, believe it or not
I like working with you
And then we have poachers
Look, I have police reports, photos...  ...Henrik's notes, my notes, Lisbeth's research
What, the private corporate records
I think Henrik would say yes
That's why he has me
Any connections between Vanger Industries...  ...and the towns where the women were killed
I'd like to take a look at them
So you won't help me
I need to know where all factories...  ...offices and projects were from 1949 to 1966
Call him
Me
Birger Furugard
Please
Thank you
Like an IKEA table
Landscape
Like his father
Like his father
Shit
Martin
Come on in
Shut the door
Just now
No
Maybe
Well, I just did
We should go hunting together sometime
Nothing
Assistant
A gun
To the right
I'm here
Why didn't you just go home
I found a photograph...  ...no one has seen
What does that prove
It also says that you and Lena Andersson were schoolmates
Is it with all the other crap on your desk
Stockholm
She's at our offices looking at more old crap
So when Lisbeth leaves, I will get a call from security...  ...so I can be at your cottage to greet her
Well, before, I do what we're doing:  Sit down, relax, have a drink
And afterwards, I just get rid of them, far out at sea
Frankly, he got what he deserved
The planning, the execution
Did I drag you in
It is
And then they sit there
And when I see the hope draining from their face...  ...like it is from yours right now..
It might amuse you to know...  ...that while you were upstairs having moose with me and Liv...  ...who, by the way, finds me very conventional..
Your sister Harriet wasn't just another girl
What happened to her
In fact, I've never touched a man...  ...except my father
May I kill him
I'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life
What happened when you were 12
It's Harriet
He was dead the year before
Fuck me
Right
About
There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad
Now I know
And she hasn't called anyone
There's only one reason she hasn't called Harriet
Because Harriet is dead
Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook...  ...Harriet
We found in the Swedish Family Registry that Anita was married
Well, what did he think about that
And he never did
Martin only started after he had died
I did
A year after the first time...  ...and there were many times during that year...  ...my father got drunker than usual one night...  ...and he started bragging about the women he'd killed
<i>A couple of months later, Henrik sent Martin to school in Uppsala.</i>  And I thought that maybe, just maybe, the nightmare was finally over
If I took anything the police might have suspected that I was still alive
I'm fine
So, what do you have to tell me
It was such a long time ago...  ...which is kind of more to the point than the money he embezzled from you
He believes that
This isn't even the plate
I was stupid
Would you feel the same about Wennerström
Go on
And how do you know this
And his accountant's and lawyer's
But that's what you'll say
<i>...Of criminal activities on a global scale.</i>  What happens now
It'll go to court
These guys never do
It's a smart, safe investment
You have 65,000 in your two accounts
<i>These allegations, like the last one from this socalled journalist...</i>  <i>...are as ridiculous as they are untrue.</i>  <i>I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again, and I'm looking forward to it.</i>  <i>What about his documentation?</i>  <i>Fabricated
At home, I imagine</i>  <i>No, he's not
Welcome to the Dolder Grand, miss
How many accounts will you transfer
<i>A Swedish tourist vacationing here in Barbados...</i>  <i>...says he knows where fugitive financier HansErik Wennerström is:</i>  <i>Here, in this Caribbean island's capital, Bridgetown.</i>  <i>Police released this photo and believe it is the disgraced billionaire.</i>  How many of these would you like to convert for deposit
Yes
Thank you
What are you doing later
It's Christmas again
Why would you
I'm happy
Fashionably late.Did you know there are more people with genius IQs living in China  than there are people of any kind living in the United States
How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people  who all got 1600 on their SATs
You got a 1600
Or you could get into a final club
This is serious
I'm trying right now
To row crew
Okay, well, they're bigger than me
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys
The Phoenix is the most diverse
The Porcellian, the Porc
I was just asking
My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer  and Eduardo won't come close to getting in
I think you asked me that  because you think the final club that's easiest to get into  is the one where I'll have the best chance
I... What
You're obsessed with finals clubs
And there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated
Well, you do
Why
Did you really just say that
We're dating
Is this a joke
What is it supposed to mean
The door guy is a friend of mine, and he's a perfectly good class of people
And what part of Long Island are you from, Wimbledon
Yes
I can't
All I meant is that you're not likely to..
You don't have to study
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat, so we're even
I think we should just be friends
Okay, you are probably going to be a very successful computer person
For the record, she may look like a 34C,  but she's getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret
Easy enough, except I need an idea
The Kirkland facebook is open on my desktop,  and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics
Let the hacking begin
They keep everything open and allow indexes in their Apache configuration
Moving right along
Lowell has some security
What a sham
You have to do searches,  and if your search returns more than 20 matches, nothing gets returned
I'll come back later
They still make you search,  but you can do an empty search and get links to pages with every student's picture
It's slightly obnoxious that they only let you view one picture at a time,  and there's no way I'm going to go to 500 pages to download pics one at a time
You and Erica split up
Are you all right
We're ranking girls
I need the algorithm
At any given time Girl A has a rating Ra and Girl B has a rating Rb
It works
Neal
Look at these girls
Left
Oh, my God
Oh, shit
Erica
One on the right
Left
At 4:00 in the morning
Harvard's network is about to crash
I do
It's not a coincidence
No, back
Can we do that
I'm not embarrassed, she just made a lot of that up
Twentytwo thousand
Is there any way to make this a fair fight
You guys hear about this
Really
A threehour lowrate technical row before breakfast
I'm not sure how we missed it
Twentytwo thousand
Way ahead of you
Tyler Winklevoss
I...  You know, I've already apologized in The Crimson to the ABHW,  to Fuerza Latina,  and to any women at Harvard who may have been insulted,  as I take it that they were
Which part
Yes
That would be impressive,  except if you had known what you were looking for,  you would have seen it written on my dorm room window
Well, they had to make an example out of you
I know
Wardo, I said I know
Who knows
Brighter men than you have tried and failed this class
You Mark Zuckerberg
Yeah
We never heard that before
You didn't
You guys look like you spend some time at the gym
So, you ever been inside the Porcellian
You understand we can't take you past the bike room,  because you're not a member
Yeah
When we checked you out, you also built CourseMatch
We were talking about CourseMatch
Didn't sell it
Okay, well, we have something that we've been working on for a while  and we think it's great
Harvard
Edu is the most prestigious email address in the country, man
Divya and my brother don't have trouble putting things indelicately
I mean, we need a gifted programmer who's creative
Our first programmer graduated and went to work for Google
I'm in
When did you come to Eduardo
Do you remember answering in the affirmative
Did you answer affirmatively  when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra  asked you to build Harvard Connection
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi
I'm developing an algorithm to define the connection  between Jewish guys and Asian girls
Hey, Mark's here
I gotta tell you something that you're not gonna believe
No
It was just a diversity thing
You said you'd come up with something
But it wasn't because they saw pictures of hot girls
It was because they saw pictures of girls that they knew
I'm totally psyched about this, too
Like getting punched
There was nothing to hack
People were gonna provide their own pictures, their own information
Did he offer terms
I said, "Let's do it.
Did he add anything else
Sy, if you'll let me continue with my line of questioning
We're off the record
Yes, sir
Yes
He resented... Mark resented that your clients thought  that he needed to rehabilitate his image after Facemash
But..
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building The Facebook,  he was leading the plaintiffs to believe he was building Harvard Connection
"I read over all the stuff you sent me re: Harvard Connection
"Sorry I was unreachable tonight
Okay, anybody else feel like there's something up with this guy
I know, I know
About 200 more
I already did
"I have a CS problem set that I'm just getting started with  "and it should be about 15 hours of coding, so I'll be busy tomorrow night.
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies
First...  Shit
I know
Who is it
What in the world is this
Yes, it was
You stole our whole goddamn idea
What
Let's continue
Have you ever seen her with anyone
People don't walk around with a sign on them that says...  Mark
Shit, that looks good
This is what drives life at college
It's why people take certain classes and sit where they sit and do what they do
What do you mean
Right now
You have no idea what that's gonna mean to my father
What
Because you got emails for everybody at the Phoenix
If we send it to our friends, it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin
Give me the mailing list
They're not so bad
I'm buying
Seven different people spammed me the same link
But I'm really hoping it's Cats That Look Like Hitler,  'cause I can never get enough of that
It's fine
We need 20 minutes
He stole our website
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler and our business partner Divya
Yes, sir
I can read it to you
Tell him Divya Narendra called
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650 students signed up for it on the first day
All right
I'm sure you're right
This is a good guy
Okay, he never saw our faces
He's gonna look at all this and if he thinks it's appropriate  he'll send a ceaseanddesist letter
That's right
How much more information are you waiting for
On the home page
He's giving us the finger in The Crimson
We're not starting a knife fight in The Crimson
He's gonna say it's stupid
This is Harvard, where you don't plant stories and you don't sue people
Sy
If you say so
Please
So it's safe to say you were aware that my clients had money
I didn't know that
Eduardo, what happened after the initial launch
Everybody on campus was using it
...at Out of Town News and picked up that copy of Popular Electronics magazine  with the MIT'S Altair kit on the cover
We've gotta start now.
Now, most of you think you know the rest of the story, but you may not
Yeah
We're...  Yeah, we..
Well, very nice to meet you
And then the other is, well, you know..
Yes, have you ever heard so many different good things  packed into one regularsized sentence
Awesome job
And I showed up late
It was Bill Gates
I wasn't wearing my contacts
Hear what I just said
What does that mean
Well, I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew, but at some point,  and I'm talking as the business end of the company, the site...  We don't even know what it is yet
That is a priceless asset I'm not giving up
Fashion
Fashion is never finished
It's called a ceaseanddesist letter
What were their names
Jesus Christ
It was addressed to me
Don't screw around with me now
They must feel they have some grounds
The grounds are our thing is cool and popular,  and Harvard Connection is lame
Why didn't you show me this letter
What are we doing about this
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services and he told me to write them back
This was the first time you raised any of those concerns, right
Yeah
It's raining
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention
Do you think I deserve your full attention
I think if your clients wanna sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall,  they have a right to give it a try,  but there's no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie
Did I adequately answer your condescending question
Oh, my God
A couple girls are freshening up in there
Hi
Mine, too
I just..
The Facebook
That's why I came over
No, there's no problem
I don't wanna be rude to my friends
You apologized, right
Dustin, I want you to share the coding work with me
Somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major
Now here's the arrangement
Any questions
Hello
And Stanford
No
I'm Marylin Delpy
Bosnia
I don't hate anybody
What
Well, looks like that ceaseanddesist letter really scared the shit out of him, huh
I want punitive relief
Like my brother and I are in skeleton costumes  chasing the Karate Kid around a high school gym
Harvard Student Handbook
This is what we needed
Why Stanford
I'm late for biochem
I should just kick your ass
What's my major
And yours
William Taft Elementary, for a little while
No
So, what do you do
Kind of like Napster
What do you mean
I just slept with Sean Parker
Broke
I appreciate that
Yeah, go ahead
Jesus
There isn't a snake, but I need to ask you something
I could've been killed
What's that
Seriously, I'm on the thing like five times a day
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg
Well, darkness is the absence of light,  and the stupidity in that instance was the absence of me
I don't know
And you're here because..
I've read the letter
Students are required to respect public and private ownership,  and instances of theft, misappropriation or...   Anne
What my brother and I came here today to ask of you, respectfully, of course...  Sir, it's against university rules to steal from another student, plain and simple
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of our emails or phone calls  for the last two weeks
I went after him and then he disappeared
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what you just said makes no sense to me at all
I really don't know
I was the US Treasury Secretary
Letting our imaginations run away with us  is exactly what we were told to do in your freshman address
Please, arrive at the point
I'm saying that
Colleagues of their father
It's not worthy of Harvard
You can take the Harvard Student Handbook and shove it...  Ty
Whoops
Yes
They went terribly
Now, here's the most impressive statistic
Is that like a tsk
Guys, what is this
Yes
It'll be embarrassing
They're not gonna card us
Then what is he
I honestly wasn't jealous
He also founded the companies
And he does own a watch
And Mark
Great to meet you
Hey, baby boy
An appletini
I didn't wanna spend my 20s as a professional defendant
But you made a name for yourself
And I wanted to do it nice this time
I'm glad we've got that on the record
You're a target for highpriced escorts
Excuse me
But there'll be payback at Case
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo
But mostly how Mark had to..
Tell me about the strategy you're using
Thanks, that was mine
Who's right
Neither of you yet
You don't even know what the thing is yet
A million dollars isn't cool
And that's where you're headed
Yep
Okay
I don't have a dog in this fight
Drop the "The.
Goodbye, sweetie
So, what do you think
I'm going to enter this into the record
And ask the respondent to stipulate that the articles of incorporation  state the ownership as follows: 65% for Mark Zuckerberg,  30% for Eduardo Saverin and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz
You never did anything to embarrass the company or even seriously jeopardize it
No
I have here an article from The Crimson...  Jesus Christ
This is another club playing a prank
I don't torture chickens
I was having dinner in the Kirkland dining hall with Mark,  and I had the chicken with me,  because I had to have the chicken with me at all times
I didn't know you couldn't do that
This was all resolved
It's better to be accused of necrophilia
Now I have to explain this to my father
That's a Facebook page
I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen
Our litigators are capable of finding a Crimson article
We are so close
Yeah, no, I agree
Was it somewhere in the middle of the Sean Parker Variety Hour
I didn't know you guys got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil
Dustin's a better programmer
No real players
Congratulations, dude
We don't know that any of that's true
Okay, don't fish eat other fish
Get on board with this, man
They have 10 minutes to get root access to a Python web server,  expose its SSL encryption,  and then intercept all traffic over its secure port
They're hacking
I also have a program running that has a popup window  appear simultaneously on all five computers
You're right
Here
Welcome to Facebook
Yes
Hang on
But mostly I figured, how much could possibly go wrong in three months
I know
It was better than that
You sure
Andrew, get the door
Good boy
We saw the chimney...   Is anybody hurt
This is my... Sharon
You made the right choice
No problem
It's exactly what it should be
That's what I'm talking about
All right
We're gonna go to the restroom
Your date looks so familiar to me
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores, and after five years, he sells the company  to Leslie Wexner and The Limited for $4 million
That's why she looks familiar to you
You know, no, that was for web cretins
Napster wasn't a failure
This is our time
He's in New York
Yes
And the water under the Golden Gate is freezing cold
The girl from high school with the lacrosse thing
Gesture of good faith
If you don't have a place to crash,  I think you should definitely come and live with us
Approaching the grandstands,  Hollandia maintains a lead of threequarters of a length
Tyler
Excellent
Of course
Have you
Mileandahalf races are more commonly won by a boat length or two
How was the royalty
Brutally excruciating
Relax, it's fine
No, don't ever apologize to me for losing a race like that
I've just had a phone chat with my daughter
Have I said something wrong
Majoring in French literature, though I wasn't aware there was such a thing
Good race, boys
Stop it, Cam
We tried talking to him ourselves, we tried writing a letter,  we tried the Ad Board, and we tried talking to the president of the university
Now, I am asking you for the last time,  let's take the considerable resources at our disposal and sue him in federal court
No, no, no, no, no
Like we know what that is
Don't
You're writing code
What's up
He was on a 36hour coding tear, so he took a nap for a couple of hours
Wardo
It's not polite to ask
Hey, man
What time is it
Show him the Wall
He just runs a $2billion hedge fund called Clarium Capital
You've had a long flight
Gary's Tuxedos
You wanna talk to me alone for a minute
How's Christy
I quit on my first day
I mean, she's actually psychotic
Did you hear what I just said
The connections, the energy...  Mark, you got..
It's moving faster than any of us ever imagined it would
Mark, I am the CFO
He set up meetings all over town
Hi
No problem
You know this is where they filmed Towering Inferno
You must be Mark
Maurice is gonna talk to you about some corporate restructuring
When did you get back
I got back this afternoon
Are you mocking me
Well, I was single when I set up the page
It's embarrassing, so you should take it as a sign of trust that I would tell you that
No, you didn't change it so you could screw those Silicon Valley sluts  every time you go out to see Mark
It's a silk scarf
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf

The users are interconnected
Did you like being nobody
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on
Maybe you were angry
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,  because, Wardo, I've got some good news
They wanna reincorporate the company
They wanna meet you
Yeah
And also, I'm breaking up with you
1,328,334
'Cause you may need to dilute it to award shares to new investors
Well, Mark doesn't care about money and he needs to be protected
Can you please repeat the question
No, it was an outrageously leading question the first time around,  and now you want us to hear it twice
You had one friend
And then before I left he said..
You gotta come back for it
Yeah
You're gonna walk in there and say you overslept  and didn't have time to get dressed
They're gonna beg you to take their money
In late November, I got the email from Mark  telling me to come out for the millionthmember party
What else did the email say
Why not
Right over here
Good
But then I started reading
Mr. Saverin
Are you still wired in
You were told that if new investors came along...  How much were your shares diluted
It wasn't
It wasn't
You're gonna blame me because you were the business head of the company,  and you made a bad business deal with your own company
Along with my hoodie and my fuckyou flipflops, you pretentious douchebag
You'll be leaving now
What's he talking about
Which I am
It's okay, I'm going
I drew it on the account you froze
And look, I wanna see everyone here geared up for a party
Mackey, put it up on the big screen
That's life in the NFL
Ashleigh
No
Well, a little bit
I appreciate that
These came in for you
Yes, sir
I've got champagne
You can do it off of me
All right, shut the music down
How they check their friends' status updates
Why did the music stop
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please
Shit
Be cool
I can tell them to turn the music down
That's not mine
No
How old are you
I'm 21
Listen, something's happened
It's gonna be online any second
You know with an intern...  No, it's cool
You don't think Wardo was involved, do you
Right
Mark
He still owns 7% of the company
I know that
Perjury
They're gonna settle
I specialize in voir dire, jury selection
I've been licensed to practice law for all of 20 months,  and I could get a jury to believe  that you planted the story about Eduardo and the chicken
Yeah
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed and used the computer for a minute
I've been waiting since 7:00
I haven't eaten in 24 hours
What are we doing
Talking
Fuck off and die
Shut up
<i>Who was that, Darlene?</i>  Don't worry about it
<i>Oh, shit.</i>  Let's go
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>   I swallowed it
<i>Okay, you're staying with your mom and Aaron tonight.</i>  <i>So, you don't like having a new little brother?</i>  <i> No, not really
Oh, that's honest.</i>  Learn a lot
Good morning
Horrid
<i>Paul, what's on the crime beat?</i>  Janice in Datebook left the fondue party before everyone got naked

Any witnesses
<i> We already corrected it

Prints
There's blood on them
I got a single 9mm casing
Who's got the fare book
That's one block east
May I
But you're not an idiot
Yeah
I just killed a man for $8.25
No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, SFPD.</i>  <i>Sir, I was wondering if I'd be able to talk to your children,</i>  one at a time and preferably alone
<i>Yeah, and he had a rag.</i>  He came around the side of the car and he was wiping stuff
<i>Well, sort of.</i>  Did you remember what he looked like
<i>"This is the Zodiac speaking.</i>  <i>"I am the murderer of the taxi driver</i>  "over by Washington Street and Maple Street last night
So he got in the front seat to tear off a piece of the shirt
<i>Robert, do you have a deadline?</i>  <i>What does he mean, it gets worse?</i>  Read the last part
"I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning
They have phones, if you want.</i>  We need to get matches on blood and fabric
Whoa
Starts with an "L."  <i> Oh, looming
Just go about your daily business

I have to concentrate
It'll screw us
<i>We're coordinating with the school board,</i>  and we expect a break in the case very soon
When they can't get anyone on the tip line  they call the switchboard and keep getting put through
<i>Well, can't you narrow it down?</i>  <i>I would love to, if I could get out of this...</i>  <i> Homicide, please hold
The only guy who's seen Zodiac without a mask is missing
<i>As soon as he got out, he split.</i>  <i>Really
We really should have been in on the handwriting
Did you guys narrow your list off of this
I work here
I'll have Questioned Documents..
I'll telefax it to you
<i>Because the two kids that got killed last Christmas were Solano's.</i>  I thought they were Vallejo
<i>No, they were over the county line</i>  <i>so you're gonna need to coordinate with them, too.</i>  Okay
And this is three minutes after the shooting
We were going west
<i>All right, so you're on Jackson going west.</i>  So the cab was one block cattycorner southwest

I just have headaches.</i>  Did you attempt to call one other time  when F. Lee Bailey was with us two or three weeks ago
I don't wanna go to the gas chamber.</i>  <i>You won't get hurt if you talk to me.</i>  And you're not going to the gas chamber
<i>Sam?</i>  <i> Let's meet and talk
<i>You know, the problem is,</i>  <i>I don't want to go to the gas chamber

Thank you
Those are the same things
Just guessed
But who actually cracked the code
Right
What's the most common double consonant in the English language
Consonant
<i>I thought they looked medieval, too.</i>  But then I found a code written in the Middle Ages
Guess what it's called
Come to bed
I need to make a phone call
<i>I'll have Vallejo and Napa check with their city planners.</i>  <i> Get some sleep
When did the letter arrive
You must see Africa
Cradle of civilization
Several times
But the real story is the letter
<i>Inspector Toschi, it is my belief this is a window into this man's soul.</i>  Killing is his compulsion
Or maybe he just likes the attention
Have a good night
<i>Yeah
I didn't know you had a baby
It was closed
She was on the side of the road
She said she jumped from a car
My baby
In case he came back

The part about Kathleen Johns.</i>  Tell me what facts he gives
Everything in the letter already appeared in the article
The police already had somebody in custody
Shit
That's the only place that word and that symbol  ever appeared together before the letters

Who is that?</i>  <i>Florence Douglas, mayor of Vallejo
Yeah
Oh, my God

I'm gonna drive down and see him tonight
Who is this guy
Hi
It's the young lady sitting by herself
I do.</i>  Great
<i> Glynnis said you were a cartoonist
<i>So, you work with Glynnis.</i>  <i> For her, actually
<i>Oh, yeah, I saw that on TV.</i>  <i>Well, I work near him and he's going down tonight</i>  to track an anonymous tipster down in Riverside
How do you mean
<i>So it could be an ambush
<i>The pasta, spaghetti?</i>  Are you ready to order yet
<i>Yeah, you know, when you were saying that the Zodiac...</i>  <i>You know, when you said it was dangerous, I just thought</i>  <i> that it is dangerous, and it's...  Stupid?</i>  Stupid
I have some change
I'll get the food to go
This is the most interesting date I've ever had
Yes
<i>Yes.</i>  You're not gonna believe this
<i>He took it to Sherwood without telling us, the son of a bitch.</i>  You know how bad this looks
Excuse me
Hey
Can I catch a ride with you gents when we get there
Please take your seats at this time.</i>  <i>Remember, smoking is in the last six aisles only.</i>  <i>Enjoy your flight.</i>   Cross
I hear you have some files for us
You show me yours
<i>She studies in the library the night of October 30th, 1966.</i>  <i>She leaves with an unidentified male at closing, 9:00 p. m.</i>  <i>Her body's found the next morning in a parking lot, stabbed to death.</i>  Her car is disabled
I have her comp right here in this file
But that will not stop the game
<i>Double postage, just like Zodiac.</i>  These are what Sherwood Morrill matched to the Zodiac letters
These and the desktop
And I told him you were gonna be here
<i>We don't have enough to pin it on him yet,</i>  but we're pretty sure it's him
By giving information to reporters?</i>  <i>Look, I don't know about the handwriting,</i>  <i>but Sherwood says it's a match, right?</i>  <i>So, let's just say that your guy did Cheri Jo.</i>  He types the confession
<i>I really don't want to talk to you right now, Paul
Oh, really
Hey, Cheri Jo Bates was a gift
I'm out here, beating the bushes,</i>  trying to draw him out
<i>Oh, boy
And how did you kill your victims
<i>Only a little rat bastard like Andre</i>  could have done something like cut off all the victims' hands
I don't know
<i>You're a cop, man
<i>So I asked him, "How would you get away with it
I thought it was a stupid name
<i>He got up all upset and said, "I don't care what you think.</i>  "I've thought about it a long time and that's the name I'm gonna use. 
That's what made me remember
Did you ever go with him
And you're sure the conversation you had about Zodiac  <i>took place on January 1st, 1968?</i>  It couldn't have been any later
This guy...  Arthur Leigh Allen?</i>  <i>This guy, Leigh, just lays out his entire evil plan</i>  to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day
So why didn't Cheney contact us sooner
Did Cheney have anything against Allen
<i>So, the check stubs are a wash
But he can't rule him out, either.</i>  <i> Well, that's vague
So what do you want to do
He thinks it's funny
<i>The letters are a little too neat</i>  <i>for someone to have written with the wrong hand.</i>  <i>But not for Leigh, right.</i>  <i> What do you mean
Vallejo
So how do you guys wanna do this
He leads, we follow?</i>  It's okay by me
Have you ever read  or heard anything about the Zodiac
But I didn't follow it after those first reports
Do you remember his name
Leigh
But I forgot to tell the other officer that
What
Is this about the Riverside killing
<i>No, that's untrue.</i>  You can't write with both hands
That is...  That is horrible
May I see it
That's very sweet
It's about this man who waits for people to get shipwrecked on this island
Sure
Thanks for your time
So does anyone think this suspect warrants further investigation
We don't see him much anymore since we found out
My old roommate
<i>Here, where he spells "Christmas" with two "S's
I can look for it
For the time being
<i>Doesn't remember how he got onto him,</i>  but didn't think he looked like a killer so he didn't like him for Z
<i>Christ, kid.</i>  Yeah
<i>Paul, it's 11:00 and we missed Editorial.</i>  <i> I'm sorry
This sample matches the canceled checks and the application
I mean, we know he's ambidextrous.</i>  <i>In 38 years, I've never seen anyone that ambidextrous.</i>  Both hands would have commonalities
Said it wasn't enough
We need Allen's right hand
I merely suggested...  On our letterhead
<i> And that you run it
Wanna grab a drink
<i> Early lunch, or...  Paul.</i>  Are you okay
We saw him recently for the first time in nine months
<i>After he left, I went to see that social worker.</i>  <i>He couldn't talk about a former patient, so I just asked him straight out</i>  if he thought Leigh was capable of killing people
He's going to school in Santa Rosa
What if I can get a second opinion
<i>Terry, all I need to know is if the suspect is ambidextrous.</i>  Could he possibly have written those letters with his other hand
<i>Get the samples of his other hand
<i>And you're willing to swear to this, under oath, in Superior Court?</i>  Without any hesitation
Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen
Military boot prints
We'll list them in the warrant
Who?</i>  That would be his sisterinlaw and a man named Phil Tucker  that he worked with at a public pool in Vallejo
Allen lives in Vallejo with his mother in her basement
On the day that the two kids were stabbed  his neighbor saw bloody knives in his truck  which he claimed were used to kill a chicken
And he mentioned Zodiac to Cheney  a year and a half before it appeared in any letter
I'll check with the neighbors
<i>Close the door, there's rodents running around.</i>  Neighbor said he tore out of here about a halfhour ago
<i>Piece of work, this guy.</i>  <i>Not one, but two blue windbreakers.</i>   Like the Stine scene
<i>Men's seven, just like the ones we found in the cab.</i>  <i>Well, he's got the same size shoes and gloves as Z.</i>  Probably just a coincidence
One automatic, one revolver.</i>  <i>Well, that's interesting.</i>  Because he happens to have an M1 rifle here in the closet
On the handwriting
<i>Fellas, he's not your guy.</i>  Damn it
Time off
Spend some time with your wife and the kids
<i>Where the hell does he expect me to find $100,000?</i>  <i>You're not thinking of paying him, are you, Mr. Mayor?</i>  <i>The city of San Francisco does not pay criminals not to commit a crime.</i>  The killer gets shot in the chest
Nice to meet you
You're gonna catch him
I'm Duffy Jennings
Nice to meet you, too.</i>  I'm just right down there at the Art department  <i> if you need anything, Duffy
Yeah
Why
Where
Okay
<i>The boys need to be tucked in, please, and the baby needs changing.</i>   I'll flip you for it
Okay
Fantastic
Nobody comes by from the old days
I've been thinking
About Zodiac
And then I was thinking that nobody knows the case better than you
Or I tossed them
It was four years ago
<i>Then, what did you ever do about it?</i>  <i>If it was so fucking important, what did you ever do?</i>  <i>You hovered over my desk, you stole from wastebaskets.</i>  Am I being unkind
The library
One moment, please.</i>   Hi
<i>Sure, why not?</i>  <i>So, you're a friend of Paul Avery's?</i>  He's actually the reason I'm here
Over 200
<i>So, nobody cares.</i>  Excuse me
<i>Now, I started thinking that if you can track these books,</i>  then maybe you can track the man
<i>So, almost every book on ciphers was stolen from the Presidio Library?</i>  And the Oakland Army Terminal Library
I can't allow you to help
Yes
Zodiac's long gone.</i>  <i>He's yesterday's news, right?</i>  That's what they say
They're all marked with these numbers
243146
"It was a strange man
Thank you so much
That's Graysmith
<i>Okay
<i>Well, he's the only surviving victim who ever saw Zodiac without a mask.</i>  <i>No, I mean, why are you asking me?</i>  <i>Mageau and Darlene, that's Vallejo's case.</i>  Paul Stine is mine
Very
It's a party where people come and help you paint
I have another way
<i>They started around 1:30 a. M.,</i>  and this was before anyone in the family knew that Darlene had been shot
This was in the Vallejo files
She's very cute
Who did he call
How do I get to Melvin Belli
I've only been waiting two hours, so...</i>  He's usually not this late
<i> You mean to Mr. Belli about the case
<i> When was this
"</i>  <i>He said, "I have to kill
"</i>  And then he hangs up
You don't
<i>Well, if my partner did talk to someone from Justice,</i>  <i>then they would've had to put that in a report.</i>  <i>That's standard procedure.</i>  <i> Okay
<i>Plus, nobody died on December 18th,</i>  <i>just like nobody died over the weekend when he was gonna kill a dozen people,</i>  or when he was gonna shoot school kids or blow up buses
What if
<i>Look, off the record, Bill Armstrong checked this out.</i>  We took this very seriously
How was your day
He said he can meet you tomorrow morning at 7:00
What's this
Why
Mr. Graysmith?</i>  <i>The Robert Graysmith mentioned in the paper today?</i>  <i> Yeah
Vaughn does not know his friend is a killer,</i>  <i>and he is storing some film canisters for him.</i>  <i>In these canisters is the evidence.</i>  <i>Okay, yeah, friend
We choose at some point in our lives how to physically construct each letter
Specifically with his "K."  <i>In his first letters, he executed the "K" with two strokes.</i>  <i>Later letters, he did them with three.</i>   Why
