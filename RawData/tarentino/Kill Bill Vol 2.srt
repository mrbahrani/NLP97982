1
00:47:12,555 --> 00:47:13,605
Master...

2
00:47:15,474 --> 00:47:17,184
Your Mandarin is lousy.

3
00:47:17,185 --> 00:47:19,560
It causes my ears discomfort.

4
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:21,188
You bray like an ass!

5
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,107
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

6
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:28,612
Is it too much to hope...
you understand Cantonese?

7
00:47:32,365 --> 00:47:33,741
I speak Japanese very well...

8
00:47:33,824 --> 00:47:37,119
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese...

9
00:47:37,203 --> 00:47:39,372
I asked if you understand Cantonese?

10
00:47:40,915 --> 00:47:41,965
A little.

11
00:47:42,582 --> 00:47:47,170
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics.

12
00:47:47,587 --> 00:47:49,673
If you can't understand me...

13
00:47:49,674 --> 00:47:51,548
I will communicate with you
like l would a dog.

14
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:55,011
When l yell, when l point,
when l beat you with my stick!

15
00:48:01,141 --> 00:48:02,977
Bill is your master, is he not?

16
00:48:04,895 --> 00:48:06,355
Yes, he is.

17
00:48:08,732 --> 00:48:12,528
Your master tells me...
you're not entirely unschooled.

18
00:48:13,444 --> 00:48:14,944
What training do you possess?

19
00:48:15,738 --> 00:48:18,324
I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style,

20
00:48:18,408 --> 00:48:22,412
And l am more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai sword.

21
00:48:23,788 --> 00:48:26,798
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!

22
00:48:26,832 --> 00:48:31,420
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for...

23
00:48:31,712 --> 00:48:33,338
Japanese fat heads!

24
00:48:38,509 --> 00:48:43,598
Your anger amuses me.
Do you believe you are my match?

25
00:48:44,181 --> 00:48:45,231
No.

26
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,560
Are you aware l kill at will?

27
00:48:48,227 --> 00:48:49,277
Yes.

28
00:48:49,812 --> 00:48:51,230
Is it your wish to die?

29
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:52,188
No.

30
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:55,107
Then you must be stupid...

31
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:57,485
Then you must be stupid... so stupid.

32
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:01,281
Rise, and let me look at your
ridiculous face.

33
00:49:01,823 --> 00:49:02,949
Rise.

34
00:49:07,536 --> 00:49:13,125
So my pathetic friend...
ls there anything that you can do well?

35
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:15,920
What's the matter?

36
00:49:16,378 --> 00:49:18,297
Cat got your tongue?

37
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:22,718
- Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

38
00:49:23,384 --> 00:49:24,802
I despise the Goddamn Japs!

39
00:49:27,847 --> 00:49:29,557
Go to that rack.

40
00:49:37,898 --> 00:49:38,948
Remove the sword.

41
00:50:05,173 --> 00:50:06,967
Let's see how good you really are.

42
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:09,427
If...

43
00:50:10,136 --> 00:50:11,846
... you land a single blow,

44
00:50:13,557 --> 00:50:15,267
I'll bow down and call you master.

45
00:50:29,572 --> 00:50:32,042
From here you can get
an excellent view of my foot.

46
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:40,540
Your swordsmanship...
is amateur at best.

47
00:50:54,678 --> 00:51:00,017
Your so-called kung-fu... is really...
quite pathetic.

48
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:06,647
I asked you to demonstrate...
what you know... and you did...

49
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:08,566
Not a goddamn thing!

50
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,237
Let's see your Tiger Crane...
match my Eagle's Claw.

51
00:52:10,414 --> 00:52:12,375
Like all Yankee women...

52
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:15,962
... all you can do is order in restaurants
and spend a man's money.

53
00:52:17,088 --> 00:52:18,714
Excruciating... isn't it?

54
00:52:18,798 --> 00:52:20,049
Yes!

55
00:52:21,634 --> 00:52:22,969
If it was my wish...

56
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:24,803
... l could chop your arm off.

57
00:52:24,886 --> 00:52:26,096
No, please don't!

58
00:52:27,597 --> 00:52:29,933
It's my arm now. l can do what l please.

59
00:52:30,517 --> 00:52:32,769
If you can stop me... l suggest you try.

60
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,030
I can't.

61
00:52:37,147 --> 00:52:38,467
Because you're helpless?

62
00:52:39,275 --> 00:52:40,325
Yes.

63
00:52:42,778 --> 00:52:44,905
Have you ever felt this before?

64
00:52:45,322 --> 00:52:46,372
No.

65
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:49,785
Compared to me... you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?

66
00:52:50,785 --> 00:52:51,995
YES!!!

67
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:55,345
THAT'S THE BEGlNNlNG!

68
00:53:00,712 --> 00:53:03,298
Ls it your wish to possess
this kind of power?

69
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,634
Yes!

70
00:53:09,177 --> 00:53:11,930
Your training will begin... tomorrow.

71
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,290
Since your arm now belongs to me...

72
00:53:23,024 --> 00:53:24,317
... l want it strong.

73
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,278
Can you do that?

74
00:53:28,988 --> 00:53:30,615
I can, but not that close.

75
00:53:30,823 --> 00:53:32,116
Then you can't do it.

76
00:53:33,366 --> 00:53:37,120
What if your enemy...
is three inches in front of you...

77
00:53:38,205 --> 00:53:39,456
... What do you do then...

78
00:53:40,582 --> 00:53:41,708
... Curl into a ball...

79
00:53:43,335 --> 00:53:45,075
... or do you put your FlST through him?

80
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:47,221
Now begin.

81
00:54:18,326 --> 00:54:20,785
It's the wood that should
fear your hand...

82
00:54:20,786 --> 00:54:23,247
- not the other way around.

83
00:54:24,081 --> 00:54:28,335
No wonder you can't do it...
you acquiesce to defeat...

84
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:29,835
- before you even begin.

85
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:20,523
If you want to eat like a dog...

86
00:56:21,814 --> 00:56:23,864
You can live and sleep
outside like a dog.

87
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,369
If you want to live and sleep
like a human...

88
00:56:29,822 --> 00:56:31,282
... pick up those sticks.

89
01:00:02,187 --> 01:00:05,857
Come on, you bitch.

90
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,438
OK, Pai Mei.

91
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,984
Here l come.

92
01:18:23,501 --> 01:18:26,962
Elle, you treacherous dog.

93
01:18:31,549 --> 01:18:33,843
l - give - you - my - word...
