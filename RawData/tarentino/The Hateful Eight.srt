00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:42,719
Chapter one
last stage to red rock

2
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:13,809
got room for one more?

3
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:20,447
Who the hell are you,
and what happened to them?

4
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:23,900
Names major marquis Warren former U.S.
calvary.

5
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:25,979
Currentrly I'm a
servant of the court.

6
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:29,011
Tryin' to bringin' a coupla'
no-goods into market.

7
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:31,203
I got paperwork on 'em in my pocket.

8
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:33,110
You takin' 'em into red rock?

9
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,384
I figure that's where you headed, right?

10
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,233
That damblasted blizzards
been on our ass for the last three hours.

11
00:05:42,353 --> 00:05:45,532
Ain't no way we gonna make it all the
way to red rock 'fore it catches us.

12
00:05:45,652 --> 00:05:48,462
So ya' hightailin' it
halfway to minnie's haberdashery?

13
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,408
You know I am.

14
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:54,301
- May I come aboard?
- Well smoke...

15
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,373
It up to me, yes.

16
00:05:57,722 --> 00:06:00,569
- But it ain't up to me.
- Who's it up to?

17
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:02,761
Fella in the wagon.

18
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,302
Fella' in the wagon not partial to company?

19
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:09,279
Fella' in the wagon he paid for a private
trip. And I'm here to tell ya'...

20
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,513
He paid a pretty penny for privacy.
So if you wanna' go to minnie's with us...

21
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:17,219
- You gotta' talk to him.
- Well...

22
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:20,932
That's what I'll do.

23
00:06:23,638 --> 00:06:25,237
Hold it black fella'!

24
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:28,201
'Fore you approach,

25
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:32,609
you take them two guns of yours and
lay 'em on that rock over yonder.

26
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:36,579
Then you raise both
your hands way above your hat.

27
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,221
Then you approach...

28
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:41,284
Molasses-like.

29
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:44,558
Real trustin' fella', huh?

30
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:45,924
Not so much.

31
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,801
Put 'em down.

32
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:10,958
Come on ahead.

33
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,814
I said way above your hat, god dammit.

34
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:18,084
Now come forward.

35
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:21,057
That's far enough.

36
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:30,863
I'll be dogged,
you black fella' I know.

37
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,839
Col. Something Warren, right?

38
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,291
Major marquis Warren.

39
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,929
I know you too.

40
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:42,072
We shared a steak dinner
once upon a time in chattanooga.

41
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,512
You John Ruth, the hangman.

42
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:45,826
That be me.

43
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:48,733
- How longs that been?
- Since that steak?

44
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,670
Eight months.

45
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:54,659
So why don't you explain to me...

46
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,554
What an African bounty
hunter's doin' wanderin'

47
00:07:57,566 --> 00:08:00,179
around in the snow in
the middle of Wyoming.

48
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:02,337
I'm tryin' to get a coupla'
of bounty's to red rock.

49
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,392
So you still in business?

50
00:08:03,512 --> 00:08:05,057
You know I am.

51
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,154
What happened to your horse?

52
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:11,665
Circumstances caused us to take the long
way around. My horse couldn't make it.

53
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,428
You don't know nothin'
about this filly here?

54
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,690
Nope.

55
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,456
Don't even know your name?

56
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:19,576
Nope.

57
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:23,110
Well I guess that makes
this one fortuitous wagon.

58
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,089
I sure as hell hope so.

59
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,249
Major marquis Warren,
this here is Daisy domergue.

60
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,611
Domergue, to you, this is maj.
Warren.

61
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:34,883
Howdy nigger!

62
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:37,937
She's a pepper, ain't she?

63
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:40,799
Now girl, don't you know
darkee's don't like bein'

64
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,985
called niggers no more.
They find it offensive.

65
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,830
- I been called worse.
- Now that I can believe.

66
00:08:46,102 --> 00:08:48,435
- Heard of her?
- Should I?

67
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:50,953
Well she ain't no John wilkes booth, but...

68
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:54,165
Maybe you might of heard
tell 'bout the price on her head.

69
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:56,354
- How much?
- Ten thousand dollars.

70
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,314
Damn, what she do?
Kill Lily langtree?

71
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:01,454
Not quite.

72
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,640
Now that ten thousand's
practically in my pocket.

73
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:08,489
It's why I ain't too anxious
to be handin' out rides.

74
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:11,085
Especially to professionals
open for business.

75
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:16,124
Well I certainly can appreciate that.
I ain't got no designs on her.

76
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:18,517
One of my fella's over
there is worth four

77
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,185
thousand, one's worth
three, and one's worth one.

78
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,466
That's damn sure good enough for me.

79
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:25,149
Well...

80
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,719
Let me see their paperwork.

81
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,949
Like I said, molasses-like.

82
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:40,306
Back off.

83
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:09,945
Look...

84
00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:14,384
I sure hate to interrupt y'all!
But we gtta' cold damn blizzard,

85
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:17,781
hot on our asses we tryin'
to beat to shelter!

86
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,323
I realize that!

87
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:22,530
Now shut your mouth
and hold them damn horses while I think!

88
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:27,795
Okay boy, we'll give it a try.

89
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:31,314
But you leave those pistols
over yonder with the driver.

90
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,852
You ain't really gonna'
let that nigger ridin' in

91
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:39,318
here is ya'? I mean maybe
up there with o.B., but-

92
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,531
how you like the sound
of them bells, bitch?

93
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:45,568
They are real pretty, ain't they?

94
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,175
You open up your trashy
mouth again, I'll knock

95
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:51,046
out them front teeth for ya'.
You got it?

96
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:54,843
Yeah.

97
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,653
Let me hear you say: "I got it."

98
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:00,907
I got it.

99
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,915
Well, I'm gonna need some help tyin'
these fella's up on the roof.

100
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:08,717
Give o.B. Fifty dollars when
ya' get to red rock, and he'll help ya'.

101
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:12,004
Well, I agree with o.B.
This storm's got me concerned.

102
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:14,521
We get goin' a lot
quicker you help out too.

103
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:17,044
Goddammit to hell, I'm
already regretting this!

104
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:21,854
Now I can't likely help ya' tie fella's
to the roof with my wrist cuffed to hers.

105
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:24,342
And my wrist is gonna'
stay cuffed to hers, and

106
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:26,635
she ain't never gonna'
leave my goddamn side,

107
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:30,489
until I personally put her in the
red rock jail! Now do you got that?

108
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:32,899
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.

109
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:39,104
Translation/timings/creator by: Deluce

110
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:31,172
so what happend to your horse?

111
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:33,802
He got old.

112
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:35,684
I done had him for a bit.

113
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:40,009
When the weather took a
turn for the worse, he

114
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,386
done what he could, but
he couldn't make it.

115
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:46,265
- That's too bad.
- Yes it is.

116
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:50,338
Me an' ole lash rode a
lotta' miles together.

117
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,351
You could say he was
my best friend-if I

118
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:56,796
considered stupid animals
firends, which I don't.

119
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,644
Never the less...
I'm gonna' miss 'em.

120
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:04,119
Who's Daisy domergue?

121
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:06,901
A no damn good murdering
bitch, that's who.

122
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:13,049
I can see you ain't got mixed emotions
'bout bringing a woman to a rope.

123
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:15,318
If by woman, you mean her?

124
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,746
No I do not have mixed emotions.

125
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:21,878
So you takin' her into red rock to hang?

126
00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:24,684
- You bet.
- Gonna' wait to watch it?

127
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,517
You know I am.

128
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:29,908
I wanna' hear her neck
snap with my own two ears.

129
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,826
You never wait to watch 'em hang?

130
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:36,045
My bounties never hang,

131
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:38,083
cause I never bring 'em in alive.

132
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:39,543
Never?

133
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:41,021
Never ever.

134
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:43,877
We talked about this in chattanooga.

135
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:47,124
Bringing desperate men in alive,
is a good way to get yourself dead.

136
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:50,465
Can't catch me sleepin'
if I don't close my eyes.

137
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:51,887
I don't wanna' work that hard.

138
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,830
No one said the job
was suppose to be easy.

139
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,400
No one said
it was suppose to be that hard, nether.

140
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:58,801
But that little lady,

141
00:13:59,156 --> 00:14:01,276
is why they call him "the hangman".

142
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:04,007
When the handbill says
dead or alive, the rest of

143
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,694
us shoot ya' in the back
from up on top of a perch

144
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:13,327
somewhere, bring ya' in dead over a saddle.
But when John Ruth the hangman catches ya',

145
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:15,810
you don't die by a bullet in the back.

146
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:20,187
When the hangman catches you...
You hang.

147
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:24,260
You overrate 'em nigger.

148
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,677
I'll give you he got guts.

149
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:28,987
But in the brains department,

150
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:33,549
he like a man who took a
high dive in a low well.

151
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,028
Now Daisy,

152
00:14:38,148 --> 00:14:41,691
I want us to work out a
signal system of communication.

153
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:44,718
When I elbow you real hard in the face...

154
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:46,682
That means: Shut up.

155
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:48,878
You got it?

156
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:51,698
I got it.

157
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,364
I...

158
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:39,844
I know we only met each other once before.

159
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:43,862
And I don't mean to unduly
imply intimacy. But...

160
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:44,982
Well...

161
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:48,197
You still got it?

162
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,144
I still got, what?

163
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:52,954
The Lincoln letter?

164
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,339
Of course.

165
00:16:57,658 --> 00:16:59,257
Do you got it on you?

166
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,095
Where?

167
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,255
Right here.

168
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,506
Look, I know you gotta'
be real careful with it and all.

169
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,668
I can imagine you probably
don't like to take

170
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,667
it in an'out of the
envelope all that often.

171
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:15,316
But if you wouldn't mind,

172
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:18,281
I'd sure appreciate seein' that again.

173
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:23,985
You right,

174
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:27,857
I don't like taking it in an'out
of the envelope that much.

175
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:29,567
- Yeah.
- But...

176
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:31,504
As your saving my life an' all,

177
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,680
I suppose I could let you read it again.

178
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:22,295
"Ole Mary Todd's callin',
so I guess it must be time for bed"

179
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:26,395
ole Mary Todd.

180
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:34,889
That gets me.

181
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:37,570
That gets me too.

182
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:42,546
You know what this is, tramp?

183
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:45,511
It's a letter from Lincoln.

184
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,308
It's a letter from Lincoln to him.

185
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:51,633
They shared a correspondence
during the war.

186
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:56,505
They was pen pals.
This is just one of the letters.

187
00:18:59,393 --> 00:19:00,393
What the...

188
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,009
O.B.

189
00:19:03,505 --> 00:19:04,162
Stop!

190
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:06,237
Whoa, easy.

191
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:13,932
Of all the stupid,

192
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,600
like to rip my goddamn arm off!

193
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,388
I didn't,

194
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:54,136
drag her stikin' ass up
this goddamn mountain, just

195
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:56,738
for you to break her neck
on the ouskirts of town.

196
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:59,586
You the one handed her my goddamn letter.

197
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:01,545
I didn't give it to her,
I gave it to you!

198
00:20:04,922 --> 00:20:07,423
That nigger like to bust my jaw.

199
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:11,612
You ruin that letter of his,

200
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:14,719
that niggers gonna' stomp your
ass to death. And when he do,

201
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,915
I'm gonna sit back on that
wagon wheel watch and laugh.

202
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:20,965
How is it?

203
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,994
She didn't help it none.

204
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:24,296
But it's alright.

205
00:20:25,031 --> 00:20:28,172
Is that the way niggers treat their ladies?

206
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:32,454
You... ain't no goddamn... lady!

207
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:39,859
Hey mister Ruth?

208
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:41,426
What?

209
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,564
There's another fella' on foot,
up here on the road!

210
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:47,651
What?

211
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:53,161
I said, there's another fella' on foot,
up here on the road!

212
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:16,372
Considering there's a blizzard goin' on,

213
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:19,633
whole lotta' fellas walkin' around,
wouldn't you say, major?

214
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:22,615
Considerin I'm one half
of them fellas, yeah...

215
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:24,303
Seems to be a lot of 'em.

216
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:27,088
This changes things, son.

217
00:21:28,158 --> 00:21:30,736
Eight thousand dollars a
lotta' money for a nigger.

218
00:21:31,763 --> 00:21:33,941
But with a partner,
eighteen's a whole lot better.

219
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:37,073
You really think I'm
in cahoots wit' that fella'? Or her?

220
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:40,541
- Put them on.
- I ain't wearin' handcuffs.

221
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:44,433
You put those on or you can stop worryin'
about this whole thing, right now.

222
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:07,594
Chapter two son of a gun

223
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:10,539
hand your weapons to the driver.

224
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:12,137
Little jumpy, ain't you?

225
00:22:12,257 --> 00:22:14,445
Never mind the jokes, just do it.

226
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:17,525
- If you say so.
- I do.

227
00:22:41,304 --> 00:22:42,304
Okay...

228
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:43,895
I done did it.

229
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,789
O.B.?
Ya' got 'em?

230
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:48,045
- I got 'em!
- Okay fella',

231
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:51,577
you keep holdin'
that lantern in that one hand,

232
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:53,768
and you keep that other
hand where I can see it.

233
00:22:54,746 --> 00:22:57,105
Walk over there where I can
get a good look at cha'.

234
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:13,359
I'll be a goddamn dog in the manger.

235
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,446
Is that you Chris mannix?

236
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:19,378
- I'm sorry friend, do we know each other?
- Not quite.

237
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,948
- You know this fella'?
- Only by reputation.

238
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,998
Like I said friend,

239
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:27,318
you got me at a bit of a disadvantage.

240
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:30,734
Keepin' you at a disadvantage,
is a advantage I intend to keep.

241
00:23:31,198 --> 00:23:32,719
Whoever you are mister,

242
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:37,256
you sure sound tough when you're talkin'
to a desperate man knee deep in snow.

243
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:39,782
I don't want no trouble.

244
00:23:40,194 --> 00:23:43,017
I just wanna' ride.
I'm freezin to death.

245
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:44,912
Who is this joker.

246
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:47,980
You heard of the rebel
renegade erskine mannix?

247
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:51,803
- Mannix's marauders?
- That's them.

248
00:23:51,923 --> 00:23:55,219
The scourge of south
Carolina, mannix marauders.

249
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:57,607
That's erskine's youngest boy, Chris.

250
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,978
What brings you in my path, Chris mannix?

251
00:24:00,098 --> 00:24:01,822
Well Mr. face,

252
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:06,088
I was riding to red rock and my horse
stepped in a gopher hole in the snow,

253
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,395
fucked up his leg,
an' had to put 'er down.

254
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:09,919
You got business in red rock?

255
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,723
- Yes I do.
- What?

256
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:13,695
I'm the new sheriff.

257
00:24:13,815 --> 00:24:15,809
- Horseshit.
- 'Fraid not.

258
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:18,748
- Where is your star?
- Well I ain't the sheriff yet.

259
00:24:18,868 --> 00:24:22,280
Once I get there they swear me in,
but that ain't happened yet.

260
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,065
And that's when
you get your star.

261
00:24:24,077 --> 00:24:26,297
You got anything that
can back any of this up?

262
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:28,553
Yeah.
When we get to red rock.

263
00:24:28,673 --> 00:24:31,878
And from the look of those
three frozen fuckers up there,

264
00:24:31,998 --> 00:24:34,487
I figure you're a bounty hunter
open for business.

265
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:37,890
And I figure you're taking them three
dead bodies into red rock to get paid?

266
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:39,862
Three dead.

267
00:24:39,982 --> 00:24:41,860
One alive.

268
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:44,541
- Who's that?
- Daisy domergue.

269
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:46,807
Who the fuck is Daisy domergue?

270
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:50,754
Not a goddamn thing to nobody,
except me and the hangman.

271
00:24:50,874 --> 00:24:51,956
The hangman?

272
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:57,085
Well I'll be double dogged damned.

273
00:24:58,137 --> 00:25:00,810
- You're the hangman, Bob Ruth.
- It's John.

274
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:02,172
And you...

275
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:04,680
Your're the nigger with the head...

276
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,589
Major marquis.

277
00:25:07,054 --> 00:25:11,399
My lord, is that really the real head
of major marquis, lookin' at me now?

278
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:14,021
Yeah it's really me and
it's really my head.

279
00:25:14,498 --> 00:25:17,839
What's goin' on, y'all havin'
a bounty hunters picnic?

280
00:25:18,223 --> 00:25:20,996
Never mind, you takin' in
them three dead bodies

281
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:23,017
and her to red rock
to get paid, ain't ya'?

282
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,666
Yeah.

283
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:24,786
Well...

284
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:29,226
The man is red rock suppose
to pay you is me. The new sherrif.

285
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:33,407
So if you wanna get paid,
you need to get me to red rock.

286
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:36,410
Well execuse me for findin'
it hard to belive a

287
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,474
town electin' you to do
anything except drop dead.

288
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:43,219
So I'm suppose to freeze death,
'cause you find something hard to belive?

289
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:49,161
No I suppose not.

290
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,229
Put them on and come inside.

291
00:26:02,956 --> 00:26:03,956
No.

292
00:26:08,562 --> 00:26:11,168
- Then you'll freeze.
- Then you'll hang.

293
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:13,747
How so?

294
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,708
Driver!

295
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:17,708
Could you come down here and join us?

296
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,978
I gotta hold these horses
I can hear you just fine from up here.

297
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,068
You heard me tell this fella'
I'm the new sheriff of red rock, right?

298
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:27,906
Yeah.

299
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,131
Red rock is my town.

300
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:34,633
And I'm gonna' enter my town
in bounty hunters chains? No sir!

301
00:26:34,753 --> 00:26:38,568
Sorry bushwackers,
I ain't entering red rock that way.

302
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:41,282
When you finally get to
red rock, you're going

303
00:26:41,294 --> 00:26:44,010
to realize every goddamn
thing I said was right.

304
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,203
And I expect you, o.B.,

305
00:26:46,323 --> 00:26:48,820
to tell the townsfolk
of red rock that John

306
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:51,398
Ruth, let their new
sheriff freeze to death.

307
00:26:51,518 --> 00:26:53,552
There ain't no bounty
on my head, bushwacker.

308
00:26:53,672 --> 00:26:56,497
You let me die, that's murder.

309
00:27:05,144 --> 00:27:06,781
Hold out your hands.

310
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:09,792
O.B.

311
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:12,401
Give the major back his iron.

312
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:16,327
One thing I know for sure,

313
00:27:16,447 --> 00:27:19,386
this nigger-hatin'
son of a gun ain't partnered up with you.

314
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:20,889
Now...

315
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,995
I'll help protect your eight thousand,

316
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,444
you help me protect my ten,

317
00:27:26,037 --> 00:27:27,037
deal?

318
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:33,887
Ain't love grand. Y'all wanna' lie on
the ground and make snow angels together?

319
00:27:44,908 --> 00:27:47,306
- Tell ya' what, Bob-
- the name's John.

320
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:52,023
When we get to red rock, I'll buy you and
major marquis there dinner and booze.

321
00:27:52,143 --> 00:27:54,796
- May way of sayin' thanks.
- I don't drink,

322
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:58,740
with rebel renegades,
and I damn sure don't break bread with 'em.

323
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:00,699
Well Mr. Ruth,

324
00:28:01,073 --> 00:28:04,282
you sound like you got
a axe to grind against the cause.

325
00:28:04,402 --> 00:28:06,589
The cause of a renegade army?

326
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:10,473
A bunch of losers gone loco, you bet I do.

327
00:28:10,698 --> 00:28:14,715
Ya' wrapped yourselves up in the
rebel flag as an excuse to kill and steal.

328
00:28:14,835 --> 00:28:19,321
And this should interest you Warren,
imparticular emancipated blacks.

329
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:21,647
Sounds like my kinda' fella'.

330
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:28,931
Sounds to me you been readin' a lotta'
newspapers printed in Washington D.C.

331
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:34,195
Anywho, I'm just tryin'
to let y'all know grateful I am.

332
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:37,549
I was a goner, and
y'all saved me.

333
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:40,364
You wanna' show me how
grateful you are...

334
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:41,764
Shut up!

335
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,095
God damnit, Daisy it's comin'.

336
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:50,813
Here, last piece.

337
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:04,978
Does he know how famous you once was?

338
00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:07,466
I don't think so.

339
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,670
Black eye.

340
00:29:11,964 --> 00:29:13,988
Do you know who he is?

341
00:29:14,322 --> 00:29:16,508
Do I know about the thirty
thousand dollar reward

342
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,718
the confederacy put on the
head of major marquis?

343
00:29:20,836 --> 00:29:21,836
Yeah.

344
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:24,416
Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting,

345
00:29:24,536 --> 00:29:26,727
but they never did
get 'em the right nigger head, did they?

346
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:28,492
No they didn't.

347
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:30,593
But it wasn't for lack of tryin'.

348
00:29:30,713 --> 00:29:35,423
Them peckawoods left their homes and their
families, and come to this snowy mountain,

349
00:29:35,543 --> 00:29:38,556
lookin' for me and fortune.

350
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,257
None of them found fortune.

351
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:43,196
The ones you ain't ever heard of no more,

352
00:29:44,163 --> 00:29:45,053
they found me.

353
00:29:45,065 --> 00:29:47,772
Now it didn't stay 30
thousand the length of the war.

354
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:51,395
Once passions had colled,
it dropped down to eight, then five.

355
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:54,321
But, I bet even
when it was five thousand,

356
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:57,822
you had your share
of country boys comin' to call?

357
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:00,167
You know I did.

358
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,745
Why did they have a reward on you?

359
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,599
The confederates took exception
to my capacity for killing them.

360
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,048
After I broke out of wellenbeck,

361
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:13,636
the south took my continued
existence as a personal affront.

362
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,878
So the cause put a reward on my head.

363
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,133
What's...

364
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:20,958
Wellenbeck?

365
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:24,037
You ain't never heard of wellenbeck
prisoner of war camp, West Virginia?

366
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,151
No reb, I ain't never heard of it!

367
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,819
You bust out?

368
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,350
Maj. Marquis did more than bust out.

369
00:30:33,136 --> 00:30:36,810
Maj. Marquis had a bright idea.
So bright...

370
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:40,663
You got to wonder,
why nobody never thought about it before.

371
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,336
Tell John Ruth about your bright idea.

372
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,033
Well the whole damn place
was just made out of kindling.

373
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:53,036
So I burnt it down.

374
00:30:59,572 --> 00:31:02,730
There was a rookie regiment
spendin' the overnight in that camp.

375
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,622
Forty-seven men...
Burnt to a crisp.

376
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:09,330
Southern youth, farmer's sons,

377
00:31:09,562 --> 00:31:11,830
- cream of the crop-
- and I say, "let 'em burn".

378
00:31:12,462 --> 00:31:15,104
I'm suppose to apologize
for killin' Johnny reb?

379
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:18,790
You joined the war to
keep niggers in chains.

380
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,509
I joined the war to
kill white Southern

381
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:24,590
crackers and that means
kill 'em anyway I can.

382
00:31:25,336 --> 00:31:29,306
Shoot 'em. Stab 'em.
Drown 'em. Burn 'em.

383
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:31,145
Drop a big ole' rock on their head.

384
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:34,779
Whatever it took to put
white Southern crackers in the ground

385
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:37,967
that's what I joined the war to do,
and that's what I did.

386
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:39,926
To answer your question, John Ruth,

387
00:31:40,046 --> 00:31:44,669
when major marquis
burned forty seven men alive,

388
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:47,543
for no more a reason then to give
a nigger a run for the trees,

389
00:31:47,663 --> 00:31:50,288
that's when the south put a reward
on the head of major marquis.

390
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,182
And I made them trees, mannix.

391
00:31:52,302 --> 00:31:55,920
And you best belive I ain't look back
till I crossed the northern line.

392
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,058
But you had a surprise waitin' for you
on the northern side, didn't ya'?

393
00:32:00,394 --> 00:32:04,583
See once they started pullin' out
all the burnt bodies at wellenbeck,

394
00:32:04,703 --> 00:32:07,857
seems not all of them boys were rebs.

395
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:11,531
You burnt up some of your own boys,
didn't ya' major?

396
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:14,032
How many burnt prisoners
they end up findin'?

397
00:32:14,152 --> 00:32:17,731
Wasn't the final yankee death count
somethin' like thirty-seven?

398
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:22,474
That's the thing about war mannix,

399
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:23,594
people die.

400
00:32:24,824 --> 00:32:28,021
So ya' chalkin' it up to "war is hell", ha?

401
00:32:28,524 --> 00:32:32,571
Well admittedly that's a hard argument
to argue with. But if memory serves,

402
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:36,154
your side didn't look at it that way.

403
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,440
I think they thought,
thirty-seven white men for one nigger

404
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,425
wasn't so hot a trade.

405
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,662
I belive they accused you

406
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:50,796
of being a kill crazy nigger who
only joined the war to kill white folks

407
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:54,170
and the whole blue and grey
of it all didn't really much matter to ya'.

408
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,166
And that's why they drummed
your black ass outta'

409
00:32:57,178 --> 00:33:00,008
the cavalry with a yellow
stripe down your back.

410
00:33:00,614 --> 00:33:02,573
Isn't it major?

411
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:03,875
Horse shit.

412
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:07,498
If he did all that, the
cavalry woulda' shot him.

413
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,650
I didn't say they could prove it.

414
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,718
But they sure did think it out loud,
didn't they major?

415
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:14,917
But,

416
00:33:14,978 --> 00:33:20,130
Warren's war record was stellar,
and that's what saved his ass.

417
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:23,747
Are you killed
yourself your share of

418
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,189
redskins in your day,
didn't ya' black major?

419
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:29,651
Cavalry tends to
look kindly on that.

420
00:33:29,663 --> 00:33:32,900
I'll tell a' what the cavalry
didn't look kindly on.

421
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,672
Mannix's marauders that's what.

422
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:38,172
And the fact that erskine
mannix's little boy

423
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,170
would talk about anybody
else's behavior

424
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:44,499
during war time makes
me wanna horse laugh.

425
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:47,167
Don't you say anything about my daddy,

426
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,616
what he fought for,

427
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:54,114
was dignity in defeat,
and against the unconditional surrender.

428
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:58,161
We weren't foreign barbatians
pounding on the city walls.

429
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:00,456
We were your brothers.

430
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:03,807
- We deserved dignity in defeat.
- Just,

431
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:08,396
how many nigger towns did y'all sack
in your fight for dignity in defeat?

432
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:11,386
My faire share, black major.

433
00:34:11,506 --> 00:34:15,768
'Cuz when niggers are scared,
that's when white folks are safe.

434
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,885
You gonna talk
that hateful nigger talk,

435
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:22,986
you ride up top wtih o.B.

436
00:34:24,534 --> 00:34:29,651
No no no,
you got me talkin' politics

437
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:31,211
I didn't wanna'.

438
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,949
Like I said y'all,
I'm just happy to be alive.

439
00:34:37,437 --> 00:34:38,437
I...

440
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:41,845
I think I'll just look out this winda'

441
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,008
let this beatuiful
carriage rock me to sleep.

442
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:49,050
And dream about how lucky I am.

443
00:35:04,091 --> 00:35:08,087
Chapter three
minnie's haberdashery

444
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:54,978
get in there.

445
00:35:58,861 --> 00:35:59,861
Easy.

446
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,872
What the hell's going on,

447
00:36:26,992 --> 00:36:29,860
we weren't expecting another stage tonight?

448
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,614
I can see
you already got another one up in here.

449
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:36,724
I just got through putting the horses away.

450
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:41,251
This ain't the normal line. But we are
stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,

451
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:46,004
so it looks like you're stuck with us.
Are minnie and sweet Dave inside?

452
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:50,032
They ain't here.
I'm running the place while they're gone.

453
00:36:51,885 --> 00:36:54,108
Where's minnie and sweet Dave?

454
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:58,732
He says they ain't here. He's lookin'
after the place while they gone.

455
00:36:58,852 --> 00:37:00,423
Who are you?

456
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:04,097
I'm Bob.

457
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:09,978
Well whoever you are,
help o.B. With the horses.

458
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,036
Get 'em outta this cold,
before that blizzard hit's 'em.

459
00:37:21,184 --> 00:37:25,945
I just put those other horses away.
You need it done fast, you need to help.

460
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,974
I got two of my best men on it.

461
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,679
You heard him freeloaders,
get to work.

462
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:38,641
Come on let's go!

463
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:42,153
- Open up!
- Kick it open!

464
00:37:42,273 --> 00:37:44,409
- What?
- Kick it open!

465
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:49,436
Shut that door,
there's a goddamn blizzard out there!

466
00:37:49,556 --> 00:37:52,788
- You gotta' nail it shut!
- You have to nail it shut!

467
00:37:53,722 --> 00:37:57,050
- Hold it shut!
- There's a hammer and nails by the door!

468
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:01,407
You have to nail it shut!
There's a hammer and nails by the door!

469
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:03,968
- Give me a hammer.
- Yeah.

470
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:16,228
You need to do two pieces of wood!
One ain't good enough!

471
00:38:16,348 --> 00:38:19,854
- Two pieces of wood.
- That fuckin' thing is busted!

472
00:38:19,974 --> 00:38:22,995
Not just one piece of wood.

473
00:38:23,115 --> 00:38:26,137
- Gimme that other piece of wood.
- Yeah, allright.

474
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:32,582
- Gimme the nail.
- Here.

475
00:38:45,682 --> 00:38:46,682
Jesus.

476
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,643
That door's a son of a gun.

477
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,527
Who's the idiot who broke that,
that Mexican fella'?

478
00:38:55,994 --> 00:38:57,283
Good heavens,

479
00:38:57,557 --> 00:38:58,910
a woman

480
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:03,019
out in this white hell.
You must be frozen solid, poor thing.

481
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:08,626
Looks like minnie's got her a full house.

482
00:39:10,802 --> 00:39:13,057
When did you fella's arrive?

483
00:39:14,072 --> 00:39:16,586
About forty minutes ago.

484
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:19,649
The cowboy fella' in the
courner, is that your driver?

485
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:20,694
No he's a passenger.

486
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:23,698
The driver lit out. He
said he was going to

487
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,672
spend the blizzard shacked
up with a friend.

488
00:39:27,787 --> 00:39:30,636
Jesus Christ, that's awful!

489
00:39:31,393 --> 00:39:36,274
Christ almighty, what that Mexican fella'
do, soak his ole socks in the pot?

490
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:41,269
I think we all felt the same way, but were
a little too polite to say something.

491
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:45,410
He don't have that problem.
. Where's the well water?

492
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,391
Over there.

493
00:39:53,203 --> 00:39:54,203
So,

494
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:59,532
all three of you fellas' headed to red
rock, when the blizzard stopped ya', huh?

495
00:39:59,652 --> 00:40:03,563
Yes, all three of us
were on that stagecouch out there.

496
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:16,872
Coffybeans?

497
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:19,998
Over there.

498
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:29,342
Get your hand outta' there.

499
00:40:33,757 --> 00:40:36,788
The new sheriff of red
rock is traveling with us.

500
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,316
Sheriff of red rock,
that'll be the day.

501
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:42,402
If he is a goddamn sheriff,
I'm a monkey's uncle.

502
00:40:42,414 --> 00:40:43,360
Good.

503
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,049
Then you can share bananas
with your nigger friend in the stable.

504
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:48,169
So...

505
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,601
The new sheriff of red
rock is traveling with you?

506
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:52,527
No he's lyin'

507
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,154
he ain't sheriff of nothin'

508
00:40:55,274 --> 00:41:00,503
he's a Southern renegade. He's just talkin'
his self outta' freezin' to death, is all.

509
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:02,879
What the fuck I tell you
about talkin', huh?

510
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:06,254
I'll bust you in the mouth right in
front of these people, I don't give a fuck!

511
00:41:06,374 --> 00:41:08,574
You never gave your name, sir.

512
00:41:08,694 --> 00:41:10,523
John Ruth.

513
00:41:10,643 --> 00:41:13,358
- Are you a lawman?
- I'm takin' her to the law.

514
00:41:13,478 --> 00:41:16,194
- You're a bounty hunter?
- That's right, Buster.

515
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:22,543
- Do you have a warrant?
- 'Course I do.

516
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,234
May I see it?

517
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:28,521
Why?

518
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:33,547
You're suppose to produce it upon request.
How am I suppose to know,

519
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:35,432
you're not a villain,

520
00:41:35,552 --> 00:41:38,783
kidnapping this woman
without a warrant in your possession?

521
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:42,972
What's your name, Buster?

522
00:41:43,745 --> 00:41:44,889
Well...

523
00:41:45,276 --> 00:41:47,660
It certainly isn't Buster.

524
00:41:48,337 --> 00:41:51,656
It's oswaldo mobray.

525
00:41:53,154 --> 00:41:55,668
- Oswaldo?
- Yes.

526
00:41:57,311 --> 00:41:58,375
Well...

527
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:02,290
I got my warrant, oswaldo.

528
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:18,283
- I take it you're Daisy domergue?
- Yeah it's her.

529
00:42:24,856 --> 00:42:28,481
- It says here, dead or alive?
- Yeah it does.

530
00:42:29,545 --> 00:42:33,605
Transporting a desperate
hostile prisoner such as her

531
00:42:33,873 --> 00:42:38,909
sounds like hard work.
Wouldn't transporting her be easier

532
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:40,170
if she were dead?

533
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:43,033
No one said the job
was suppose to be easy.

534
00:42:43,153 --> 00:42:45,344
And why is her hanging proper,
so important to you?

535
00:42:45,464 --> 00:42:49,510
Let's just say I don't like to cheat the
hangman. He's gotta' make a living too.

536
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,370
Well I appreciate that.

537
00:42:52,288 --> 00:42:56,719
Allow me to properly introduce myself.

538
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,135
I'm oswaldo mobray,

539
00:42:59,255 --> 00:43:01,584
the hangman in these parts.

540
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,268
- Looks like I brought you a customer.
- So it would appear.

541
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:16,222
Have you ever spent two days or more
locked up with one of your customers?

542
00:43:16,342 --> 00:43:17,289
No I can't say I have.

543
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:20,179
Don't talk to my prisoner. I talk to
my prisoner, that's it. You got it?

544
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:22,384
I got I got. Jolly good.

545
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:26,379
You got anything in here besides
coffee that can help warm us up?

546
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:29,670
The bar is open, follow moi.

547
00:44:28,685 --> 00:44:29,832
All right.

548
00:44:31,095 --> 00:44:32,095
All right.

549
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:34,324
Come on, goddamnit I'm cold!

550
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:45,628
I'll feed and water the horses.
You go inside and get some hot coffy.

551
00:44:46,156 --> 00:44:49,293
I've got some stew cooking.
Should be done soon.

552
00:44:49,305 --> 00:44:50,354
Now look...

553
00:44:50,474 --> 00:44:53,499
Now matter how bad this blizzard gets,

554
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:58,783
we still gotta' feed these horses
and take a squat from time to time.

555
00:44:58,903 --> 00:45:01,839
So me an' Chris better lay out a line

556
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:06,070
from the stable to the front door,
and from the front door to the shithouse.

557
00:45:07,527 --> 00:45:08,527
Okay?

558
00:45:11,936 --> 00:45:12,980
Good idea.

559
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:16,164
Come on, Chris.

560
00:45:18,497 --> 00:45:19,914
I'll give you a hand.

561
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:23,523
No no no, go inside, get warm.

562
00:45:23,756 --> 00:45:27,780
You're doing stable work in a goddamn
blizzard, I offer to help and you say no?

563
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,835
You're right, mi amigo.

564
00:45:31,737 --> 00:45:32,737
Muchas gracias.

565
00:45:35,484 --> 00:45:37,172
All right, follow me.

566
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,469
We gonna' drop one,
every ten paces.

567
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:54,331
- From here to the door.
- Yeah! - All right.

568
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,643
Now, you're wanted for murder.

569
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:02,962
For the sake of my analogy,
let's just assume that you did it.

570
00:47:03,082 --> 00:47:07,070
John Ruth wants to take you back to
red rock to stand trail for murder.

571
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,953
And, if...
You're found guilty,

572
00:47:11,073 --> 00:47:16,624
the people of red rock will hang you in the
town square. And as the hangman,

573
00:47:16,744 --> 00:47:18,783
I will perform the execution.

574
00:47:19,942 --> 00:47:24,277
And if all those things
end up taking place,

575
00:47:24,397 --> 00:47:29,254
that's what civilized
society calls "justice".

576
00:47:31,074 --> 00:47:32,396
However,

577
00:47:33,153 --> 00:47:36,684
if the relatives and the
loved ones of the person

578
00:47:36,696 --> 00:47:40,026
you murdered were outside
that door right now.

579
00:47:40,146 --> 00:47:44,331
And after busting down that
door, they drug you out

580
00:47:44,343 --> 00:47:48,137
in the snow and hung you
up by the neck, that,

581
00:47:48,257 --> 00:47:50,820
we would be frontier justice.

582
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,502
Now the good part

583
00:47:53,622 --> 00:47:58,690
about frontier justice is
it's very thirst quenching.

584
00:47:58,996 --> 00:48:03,508
The bad part is
it's apt to be wrong as right.

585
00:48:03,628 --> 00:48:06,471
Not in your case. In
your case, you'd have it

586
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,276
comin'. But other people,
maybe not so much.

587
00:48:09,396 --> 00:48:13,854
But ultimately what's the
real difference between the two?

588
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:19,412
The real difference is me...
The hangman.

589
00:48:19,532 --> 00:48:22,187
To me, it dosen't matter what you did.
When I hang you, I

590
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,728
will get no satisfaction from your death.
It's my job.

591
00:48:24,848 --> 00:48:30,690
I hang you in red rock, I move on to the
next town, I hang someone else there.

592
00:48:31,752 --> 00:48:34,362
The man who pulls the lever,

593
00:48:34,482 --> 00:48:38,648
that breaks your neck
will be a dispassionate man.

594
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:42,827
And that dispassion is
the very essence of

595
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:47,179
justice. For justice delivered
without dispassion,

596
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:52,649
is always in danger of not being justice.

597
00:48:52,769 --> 00:48:53,971
Amen.

598
00:49:19,298 --> 00:49:22,811
No offense cowboy fella',
just gettin' your attention.

599
00:49:23,873 --> 00:49:26,112
Yeah, well...

600
00:49:26,725 --> 00:49:28,674
You got it.

601
00:49:29,045 --> 00:49:31,107
What'cha writing firend?

602
00:49:32,573 --> 00:49:36,456
- Only thing I'm qualified to write about.
- What's that?

603
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,615
My life story.

604
00:49:38,735 --> 00:49:42,159
- You're writing your life story?
- You bet I am.

605
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:43,754
Am I in it?

606
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:48,072
You just entered.

607
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,824
Well you like writing
stories so much, why don't

608
00:49:50,836 --> 00:49:52,825
you tell me the story
that brings you here?

609
00:49:54,629 --> 00:49:56,466
- Who's askin'?
- I am.

610
00:49:56,586 --> 00:50:00,026
John Ruth. I'm bringin' in
this one to red rock to hang.

611
00:50:00,146 --> 00:50:02,389
Ain't no way I'm spendin'
a coupla' nights under a

612
00:50:02,401 --> 00:50:04,611
roof with somebody I don't
know who you they are.

613
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:07,196
And I don't know who you are.
So...

614
00:50:07,316 --> 00:50:09,097
Who are you?

615
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:11,110
- Joe gage.
- What?

616
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:13,720
That's my name, Joe gage.

617
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,506
Okay Joe gage, why you goin' to red rock?

618
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:20,728
- I ain't goin' to red rock.
- Where you goin'?

619
00:50:21,404 --> 00:50:24,626
- About nine miles outside of red rock.
- What's there?

620
00:50:24,746 --> 00:50:25,883
My mother.

621
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:28,638
Your mother?

622
00:50:29,105 --> 00:50:31,861
Listen,
I'm just a cow puncher I just...

623
00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:35,228
I got back from a long drive and...

624
00:50:35,348 --> 00:50:38,128
I wasn't just an ass in a saddle this time,

625
00:50:39,691 --> 00:50:41,448
I was a partner.

626
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:44,332
For the first time in my life I,

627
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:47,087
made a pretty penny and, eh...

628
00:50:49,357 --> 00:50:53,210
Come home and spend time with
my mother for Christmas.

629
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,335
Now that's funny.

630
00:50:57,044 --> 00:51:00,186
'Cuz you don't look like the
coming home for Christmas type.

631
00:51:00,306 --> 00:51:02,145
Yeah, well...

632
00:51:03,998 --> 00:51:07,801
You know, looks
can be deceiving.

633
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,151
Because I definitely am a...

634
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:15,566
Coming home for Christmas to
spend time with mother type.

635
00:51:17,548 --> 00:51:19,627
Christmas with mother?
I mean...

636
00:51:21,302 --> 00:51:23,026
It's a wonderful thing.

637
00:51:24,927 --> 00:51:29,293
Now is that... good
enough for you?

638
00:51:29,413 --> 00:51:30,679
John Ruth?

639
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:34,610
For now.

640
00:51:35,995 --> 00:51:38,138
Just steer clear of my prisoner.

641
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,116
Hello old timer.

642
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:47,112
General.

643
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:49,803
General.

644
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:52,897
You sir,

645
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:55,394
are a hyena.

646
00:51:57,085 --> 00:51:59,276
And I have no wish to speak to you.

647
00:52:03,884 --> 00:52:05,688
I've been called worse.

648
00:52:08,878 --> 00:52:10,763
Fair enough, general.

649
00:52:11,537 --> 00:52:12,858
Sorry to bother you.

650
00:52:17,111 --> 00:52:18,751
- You gonna' kick it open.
- Kick it open.

651
00:52:29,936 --> 00:52:31,402
It's already cold enough in here.

652
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:38,770
It dosen't have latch you
gonna' hammer up a board.

653
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:39,459
You gotta' nail it shut!

654
00:52:39,579 --> 00:52:43,583
- The hammer and nails is by the door.
- There is a hammer and nails right there!

655
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:45,071
Oh god,

656
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,583
- holdin' this Chris.
- Here, here.

657
00:52:57,526 --> 00:52:59,234
You need to nail it in!

658
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:05,873
You need two pieces of wood.
You gotta' hammer another one.

659
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:09,127
One ain't good enough!
It's gonna' blow right open.

660
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,494
- Goddamn it!
- It's gotta' open if you don't.

661
00:53:12,614 --> 00:53:16,093
- Shut up!
- I got it! Son of a bitch!

662
00:53:28,514 --> 00:53:31,382
Jesis Christ,
that door's a whore!

663
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:38,085
I get it, haberdashery,

664
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,527
that was a joke.

665
00:53:40,647 --> 00:53:42,193
How's the coffy?

666
00:53:42,313 --> 00:53:45,560
Now, pretty good, if I do say so myself.

667
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:49,590
Thank you.

668
00:54:07,231 --> 00:54:09,600
Guess who he is?

669
00:54:11,243 --> 00:54:12,693
Buffalo bill?

670
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:15,706
Hardly, no.

671
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:20,701
- I'm oswaldo mobray, I'm the-
- he's the hangman of red rock.

672
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:24,100
- Oh, you are?
- Yes I am.

673
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,707
Well good to meet you Mr.?

674
00:54:28,827 --> 00:54:32,075
- Mobray.
- Mobray, I'm Chris mannix,

675
00:54:32,195 --> 00:54:34,266
- the new sheriff in red rock.
- Really?

676
00:54:34,386 --> 00:54:35,861
Horseshit!

677
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,729
- Pay no attention to him.
- Horseshit!

678
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:42,756
Fella' warmin' himself by the that pot
by the stove is a hell of driver named o.B.

679
00:54:42,876 --> 00:54:45,544
That's the only thing you
said that's the truth.

680
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:49,273
You comin' into red rock
to hang Lance Lawson?

681
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:49,974
Precisely.

682
00:54:50,094 --> 00:54:52,423
- Do you have the execution orders on you?
- In my beg.

683
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:54,357
- May I see 'em?
- Of course.

684
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:03,057
Who's Lance Lawson?

685
00:55:03,177 --> 00:55:06,327
He's a fell' been sittin' in the
red rock jail about a month now.

686
00:55:06,447 --> 00:55:11,321
He's the fella - who shot the fella' -
who was sheriff 'fore me.

687
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,062
Precisely.

688
00:55:23,422 --> 00:55:25,563
What did she mean when she said,

689
00:55:25,683 --> 00:55:28,046
bounty hunter's nigger
friend in the stable?

690
00:55:28,835 --> 00:55:31,155
He's got a nigger
bounty hunter firend in the stable.

691
00:55:32,364 --> 00:55:34,221
But all that
just to guard her?

692
00:55:34,233 --> 00:55:37,036
I don't think that was
the original idea, but...

693
00:55:37,455 --> 00:55:39,888
That's the idea now.

694
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,223
- Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy?
- Yeah.

695
00:55:44,626 --> 00:55:46,011
Five of you?

696
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:48,661
Well, well, well, looks
like minnie's haberdashery

697
00:55:48,673 --> 00:55:50,538
is about to get cozy
for the next few days.

698
00:55:50,658 --> 00:55:52,085
Yes it does.

699
00:56:01,295 --> 00:56:03,156
Who's the chap with the Lincoln letter?

700
00:56:05,137 --> 00:56:06,652
The Lincoln what?

701
00:56:07,151 --> 00:56:09,181
The letter from Abraham Lincoln?

702
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,823
President Abraham Lincoln?

703
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:16,802
- Weren't you pen pals?
- With the president?

704
00:56:17,705 --> 00:56:20,669
I'm sorry, I heard somebody
in your party had a

705
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:23,843
letter from Abraham Lincoln,
I assumed it was you.

706
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,487
Not him!

707
00:56:25,607 --> 00:56:28,097
The black fella' in the stable.

708
00:56:28,217 --> 00:56:33,333
The nigger in the stable
has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

709
00:56:33,752 --> 00:56:34,961
Yeah.

710
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:39,456
The nigger in the stable
has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

711
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,536
Say your name was again?

712
00:56:57,293 --> 00:56:59,404
- Bob.
- Warren.

713
00:56:59,524 --> 00:57:01,305
Minnie and sweet Dave in there?

714
00:57:01,425 --> 00:57:05,631
Minnie and sweet Dave went to visit her
mother on the north side of the mountain.

715
00:57:05,751 --> 00:57:07,234
- What?
- Yeah.

716
00:57:07,354 --> 00:57:11,343
- They ain't here?
- Yes, they're visiting her mother.

717
00:57:11,463 --> 00:57:12,809
- Her mother?
- Yes.

718
00:57:16,692 --> 00:57:18,497
I never knew minnie had a mother.

719
00:57:22,042 --> 00:57:24,072
Everybody's got a mother.

720
00:57:25,489 --> 00:57:26,955
Yeah, I suppose.

721
00:57:29,629 --> 00:57:33,287
- And she left you in charge?
- Si.

722
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,475
That sure don't sound like minnie.

723
00:57:39,861 --> 00:57:41,843
Are you callin' me a liar?

724
00:57:43,615 --> 00:57:45,194
Not yet, I ain't.

725
00:57:46,628 --> 00:57:50,027
- But it sounds peculiar, though,
- what sound peculiar?

726
00:57:50,543 --> 00:57:54,635
Well first of, minnie never struck me
as the sentimental type.

727
00:57:54,755 --> 00:57:55,908
Secondly,

728
00:57:56,028 --> 00:57:57,980
I can't imagine sweet
Dave liftin' his fat ass

729
00:57:57,992 --> 00:58:00,081
outta' his chair long
enough to fetch well water,

730
00:58:00,201 --> 00:58:02,772
unless minnie was
layin' a fryin' pan upside his head.

731
00:58:02,892 --> 00:58:05,285
Along takin' trips to the north side.

732
00:58:05,405 --> 00:58:10,699
That sounds a whole lot like you're calling
me a liar, mi negro amigo.

733
00:58:11,343 --> 00:58:13,937
Yeah it do sound a whole
lot like, don't it?

734
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:16,982
But I still haven't done it yet.

735
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:21,267
Minnie still serve food?

736
00:58:22,057 --> 00:58:26,009
- Do you consider stew food?
- Yes. - Then we serve food.

737
00:58:26,129 --> 00:58:29,983
She still stinkin' up the place
with her "old quail" pipe tobacco?

738
00:58:34,012 --> 00:58:36,702
Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe.

739
00:58:37,121 --> 00:58:39,209
She rolls her own.

740
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:41,851
"Red apple tobacco"

741
00:58:41,971 --> 00:58:45,693
but mi negro amigo,
I think you already know this.

742
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,415
Yeah I do, senor Bob.

743
00:58:48,673 --> 00:58:50,961
Just seein' if you do.

744
00:59:33,163 --> 00:59:36,337
- Fill me up, o.B.
- Yeah.

745
00:59:36,595 --> 00:59:38,544
Goddamn it!

746
00:59:40,815 --> 00:59:42,233
Thank you.

747
00:59:50,225 --> 00:59:53,930
Well cut my legs off and call me shorty...

748
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:57,555
Is that genaral sanford smithers I see?

749
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:00,771
You've got a good eye son.

750
01:00:02,276 --> 01:00:04,870
Well, I'll be double dogged damned!

751
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:09,487
General Sandy "don't give a damn" smithers!

752
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,523
Captain Chris mannix, mannix marauders.

753
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:15,713
- Erskine's boy?
- Yes sir.

754
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:18,486
May I sit down, sir?

755
01:00:18,498 --> 01:00:21,127
According to the Yankees,
it's a free country.

756
01:00:22,303 --> 01:00:24,511
Genaral Sandy smithers...

757
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:26,687
Boy...

758
01:00:27,765 --> 01:00:29,167
Oh boy.

759
01:00:29,287 --> 01:00:32,680
Did my daddy talk about you.

760
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,676
I heard you gave those
blue bellies sweet hell.

761
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:40,446
Me and my boys did our part.

762
01:00:40,768 --> 01:00:43,373
Just like erskine and
his boys did their part.

763
01:00:43,385 --> 01:00:44,506
Hell yeah, we did.

764
01:00:44,893 --> 01:00:48,969
- Yankees sons of bitches?
- I never knew your father, son.

765
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:54,706
But, I always respected his resolve.

766
01:00:54,826 --> 01:01:00,232
Thank you for saying that, general. Your
respect woulda' meant the world to him.

767
01:01:01,808 --> 01:01:03,548
Can I get ya' some coffy?

768
01:01:04,773 --> 01:01:07,145
- That would be nice.
- Well, how about a blanked?

769
01:01:09,284 --> 01:01:11,360
That would be even nicer.

770
01:01:11,721 --> 01:01:14,414
Hell, you know what,
you can have mine.

771
01:01:18,023 --> 01:01:19,351
Here we go general.

772
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:26,878
So what brings you out Wyoming way, sir?
If ya' don't mind me askin'?

773
01:01:26,998 --> 01:01:28,438
My boy.

774
01:01:28,558 --> 01:01:30,860
You gotta' boy that lives in red rock?

775
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:35,768
My son, Chester
Charles smithers,

776
01:01:35,888 --> 01:01:38,349
he died out here a few years back.

777
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:41,464
Forgive me sir.

778
01:01:41,584 --> 01:01:45,048
No forgiveness needed, son.

779
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:48,313
Like I said, it was a few years back.

780
01:01:48,433 --> 01:01:51,058
It was after he served his service.

781
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,781
He came out here to the hills of Wyoming,

782
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:59,385
to make his fortune.

783
01:02:01,344 --> 01:02:03,264
Never to be heard from again.

784
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:12,520
I bought him a symbolic plot

785
01:02:14,145 --> 01:02:16,207
in the red rock cemetery.

786
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:21,517
I'm here to advise the stone maker
on his headstone.

787
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,289
Was he a goner fer' sure?

788
01:02:24,753 --> 01:02:27,875
No chance he could be livin'
"the cold life" out in

789
01:02:27,887 --> 01:02:31,141
the woods? It's a rough life,
but folks can learn it.

790
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:34,277
If he had done what he came here to do,

791
01:02:34,535 --> 01:02:36,250
he'd a come home.

792
01:02:39,343 --> 01:02:40,928
Close it, close it!

793
01:02:44,718 --> 01:02:47,312
You have to hold it closed
while I nail it shut!

794
01:02:47,324 --> 01:02:49,929
Really? Who's the idiot
who broke the damn door?

795
01:02:51,124 --> 01:02:53,212
Fucking hold it low.

796
01:03:01,285 --> 01:03:02,867
Okay.

797
01:03:09,854 --> 01:03:11,206
Hold it, mi negro amigo.

798
01:03:14,493 --> 01:03:16,465
We need two pieces of wood.

799
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:21,866
Ola mi cabron.

800
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:25,165
There you go, motherfucker!

801
01:03:29,367 --> 01:03:32,447
- That's a lotta' hats, senor Bob?
- Huh?

802
01:03:32,567 --> 01:03:35,850
Considering minnie's no
hats indoors policy? Which,

803
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:38,761
if I remember it correctly,
that was one of them bar of iron rules,

804
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:41,431
kinda rule,
she'd want kept up in her absence.

805
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:45,014
You seem to have a laissez faire
attitude when it comes to the hats.

806
01:03:45,542 --> 01:03:46,806
I'm guilty.

807
01:03:46,926 --> 01:03:50,144
I have a laissez faire
attitude about the hats.

808
01:03:50,264 --> 01:03:52,588
How about we forget
about the hats today,

809
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,326
considering there's a
blizzard going on and all,

810
01:03:55,446 --> 01:03:58,497
and make tomorrow "no hat day"?

811
01:04:05,315 --> 01:04:07,957
A large black dog.

812
01:04:12,043 --> 01:04:14,221
Labrador.

813
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:25,857
You know my daddy,
I said that my daddy!

814
01:04:25,977 --> 01:04:29,148
Always said that Davis
was a courages man.

815
01:04:29,268 --> 01:04:34,213
But he should have put capital
in Montgomery and not Richmond.

816
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:39,433
Yes, sir. I agree with that the army in
north Virginia would've been used in a...

817
01:04:39,553 --> 01:04:43,958
I said the army of north Virginia would
have been used in very different way.

818
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:49,939
Shut up!

819
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:57,590
O.B.?

820
01:05:01,102 --> 01:05:03,770
Do you know that nigger, sir?

821
01:05:04,092 --> 01:05:06,783
I don't know that nigger.

822
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,236
But I know he's a nigger.

823
01:05:09,356 --> 01:05:11,362
And that's all I need to know.

824
01:05:20,502 --> 01:05:23,917
Well that nigger just ain't any nigger.

825
01:05:24,037 --> 01:05:27,046
- That nigger is-
- general sanford smithers?

826
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,847
Battle of Baton Rouge?

827
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:37,620
Inform the nigger in the
cavalry officers uniform

828
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:42,763
that I had a division
of confederates under my commend,

829
01:05:42,883 --> 01:05:43,948
in Baton Rouge.

830
01:05:44,068 --> 01:05:50,032
Major nigger, general smithers wishes me to
inform you... I heard 'em hillbilly.

831
01:05:50,152 --> 01:05:54,879
Inform this old cracker that
I was in Baton Rouge also.

832
01:05:55,123 --> 01:05:56,902
On the other side.

833
01:05:57,869 --> 01:05:59,674
Oh that's interesting.

834
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:04,314
General smithers,
he said that he was also in Baton Rouge.

835
01:06:04,434 --> 01:06:08,426
- On the other-
- cap't mannix, tell the nigger,

836
01:06:08,546 --> 01:06:12,667
that I don't acknowledge
niggers in northern uniforms.

837
01:06:12,787 --> 01:06:15,967
You captured a whole
colored command that day.

838
01:06:16,087 --> 01:06:19,666
But not one colored trooper
made it to a camp, did they?

839
01:06:19,786 --> 01:06:22,360
We had neither the time or the food.

840
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,262
Nor the inclination
to care for northern horses,

841
01:06:28,382 --> 01:06:32,297
and least of all northern niggers.

842
01:06:32,417 --> 01:06:36,305
- So we shot 'em where they stood.
- Gentlemen,

843
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,122
gentlemen,

844
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:42,414
I know Americans aren't apt

845
01:06:42,534 --> 01:06:48,098
to let a little thing like an unconditional
surrender get in the way of a good war.

846
01:06:48,218 --> 01:06:52,983
But I strongly suggest we don't restage
the battle of Baton Rouge,

847
01:06:53,103 --> 01:06:57,649
during a blizzard
in minnie's haberdashery.

848
01:06:57,769 --> 01:07:01,709
Now, my nubian friend,

849
01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:06,620
while I realize passions are high,
that was a while ago.

850
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:10,849
And if you shoot this
un-armed old man I guarantee

851
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:14,740
I will hang you by the
neck until you are dead.

852
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:17,266
Once we arrive in red rock.

853
01:07:20,887 --> 01:07:23,697
I damn will guarantee that too.

854
01:07:23,817 --> 01:07:26,507
Yeah Warren,
that's the problem with old men.

855
01:07:26,627 --> 01:07:29,341
You can kick 'em down
the stairs and say it's

856
01:07:29,353 --> 01:07:31,841
a accident, but ya'
can't just shoot 'em.

857
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:36,971
Gentlemen, since we
may be trapped here,

858
01:07:37,091 --> 01:07:41,212
close together like for a few days,

859
01:07:41,332 --> 01:07:45,787
may I suggest a possible solution?

860
01:07:45,907 --> 01:07:49,215
We divide minnie's in half.

861
01:07:49,335 --> 01:07:53,430
The northern side
and the Southern side.

862
01:07:54,152 --> 01:07:56,885
With the dinner table

863
01:07:57,005 --> 01:08:01,164
operating as a neutral territory.

864
01:08:01,284 --> 01:08:05,856
We could say that the
fireplace side of the room,

865
01:08:05,976 --> 01:08:11,024
acts as a symbolic representative of...

866
01:08:11,144 --> 01:08:12,893
Georgia

867
01:08:14,182 --> 01:08:18,526
while the bar, represents...

868
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,132
Philadelphia!

869
01:08:24,252 --> 01:08:28,140
As long aas the bar's Philadelphia I agree.

870
01:08:36,867 --> 01:08:40,231
We still got that deal
we talked about in the wagon?

871
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:45,979
I help you protect your eight thousand,
you help me protect my ten?

872
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:52,437
One of them fella's
is not what he says he is.

873
01:08:52,682 --> 01:08:54,370
What is he?

874
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:57,683
He's in cahoots with this one
that's what he is.

875
01:08:57,803 --> 01:09:03,599
One of them, maybe even two of 'em,
is here to see domergue goes free.

876
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:08,471
And to accomplish that goal,
they'll kill everbody in here.

877
01:09:08,591 --> 01:09:12,229
And they got 'em coupla' days.
So all they gotta' do

878
01:09:12,241 --> 01:09:15,754
is sit tight and wait for
a winda' of opportunity.

879
01:09:15,874 --> 01:09:19,002
And that's when they strike,

880
01:09:20,381 --> 01:09:22,108
huh bitch?

881
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:25,833
If you say so, John.

882
01:09:27,586 --> 01:09:30,160
Are you sure you're not
just being paranoid?

883
01:09:30,172 --> 01:09:31,492
Our best bet is this,

884
01:09:31,612 --> 01:09:35,733
duplicitous fella' ain't
as cool a customer as Daisy here.

885
01:09:35,853 --> 01:09:41,249
He won't have the leather patience
it takes to just sit here and wait.

886
01:09:41,369 --> 01:09:47,139
But waiting for an oportunity, and knowing
it's the right one, isn't so easy.

887
01:09:47,259 --> 01:09:50,929
If he can't handle it, he'll stop waiting.

888
01:09:51,049 --> 01:09:56,536
He'll try and create his opportunity.
And that's when mr. Jumpy reveals himself.

889
01:09:56,897 --> 01:09:59,165
And what do you got to say about all this?

890
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:03,302
What do I got to say?
About John Ruth's ravings?

891
01:10:03,947 --> 01:10:07,569
He's absolutely right.

892
01:10:07,689 --> 01:10:11,419
Me and one of them fella's
is in cahoots. And

893
01:10:11,431 --> 01:10:15,173
we're just waitin' for
everybody go to sleep.

894
01:10:15,293 --> 01:10:19,311
That's when we gonna' kill y'all.

895
01:10:19,762 --> 01:10:22,765
Okay everybody,

896
01:10:25,339 --> 01:10:27,922
hear this.

897
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:32,253
This here is Daisy domergue.

898
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:35,914
She's wanted dead or alive for murder.

899
01:10:36,034 --> 01:10:38,788
Ten thousand dollars.

900
01:10:38,908 --> 01:10:42,023
That money's mine boys.

901
01:10:42,143 --> 01:10:44,588
Don't wanna' share it.

902
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:47,626
I ain't gonna' lose it.

903
01:10:47,746 --> 01:10:53,804
When the sun comes out, I'm taking
this woman into red rock, to hang.

904
01:10:59,501 --> 01:11:01,074
Now...

905
01:11:04,489 --> 01:11:07,699
Is there anybody here...

906
01:11:07,819 --> 01:11:10,792
Comitted to stopping me'...

907
01:11:10,912 --> 01:11:13,396
From doing that?

908
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:25,371
Really?

909
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:27,974
Nobody gotta' problem with this?

910
01:11:33,285 --> 01:11:38,531
Well, I guess that's
very fortunate for me.

911
01:11:38,651 --> 01:11:43,777
However, I hope you
all understand,

912
01:11:43,897 --> 01:11:47,901
I can't just take your word.

913
01:11:48,021 --> 01:11:53,096
Circumstances force
me to, take...

914
01:11:53,216 --> 01:11:56,074
Precautions.

915
01:11:56,194 --> 01:12:00,826
When you say precautions...

916
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:04,568
Why do I feel you mean me?

917
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:09,738
- Because I'm gonna' take your gun, son.
- You are? - Yes I am.

918
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:13,591
- Nothing personal.
- Just mine?

919
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:16,205
The hangman got
himself a gun too?

920
01:12:16,217 --> 01:12:20,010
I'll be dealing with his
gun after I deal with yours.

921
01:12:27,124 --> 01:12:30,888
I feel kinda' naked without it.

922
01:12:31,008 --> 01:12:34,342
Oh, I still got mine.

923
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,737
I'll protect you.

924
01:12:46,136 --> 01:12:50,532
A bastards work is never
done, huh, John Ruth?

925
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,999
That's right, Joe gage.

926
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:57,543
- Now gimmie the gun.
- You want it?

927
01:12:57,663 --> 01:13:00,533
You have to come and take-

928
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:04,490
calm down.

929
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,627
Take your hand away from your gun.

930
01:13:11,475 --> 01:13:14,607
Blink if you're calm.

931
01:13:14,839 --> 01:13:17,636
- Did he blink?
- He blinked.

932
01:13:17,756 --> 01:13:21,451
Blink if your gonna' remain calm?

933
01:13:24,016 --> 01:13:27,973
- He blinked.
- Take his pistol.

934
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:33,512
I'm real sorry about this, son.

935
01:13:33,632 --> 01:13:39,251
Like I said, nothing personal.
Just a precaution.

936
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:26,902
Pretty sneaky.

937
01:15:01,949 --> 01:15:05,687
I'm afraid the same
applies to you too, Mr.

938
01:15:05,807 --> 01:15:07,195
Mobray.

939
01:15:07,315 --> 01:15:12,647
Precautions must be taken
because life is too sweet to lose.

940
01:15:17,004 --> 01:15:19,453
Hand me that little bucket.

941
01:15:29,532 --> 01:15:30,821
O.B.?

942
01:15:32,581 --> 01:15:34,352
Go to the outhouse.

943
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:39,521
Take this bucket and dump
it down the shit hole.

944
01:15:40,926 --> 01:15:43,045
Why do I gotta' go outside?

945
01:15:43,057 --> 01:15:47,319
Your jacket's already on.
And I sorta kinda trust you.

946
01:16:26,463 --> 01:16:28,487
After you major.

947
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:47,061
Okay.

948
01:16:48,865 --> 01:16:51,907
I'm gonna' cut you loose while we eat.

949
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:54,897
Don't get any ideas,
I ain't goin' soft on ya'.

950
01:16:56,147 --> 01:16:59,139
You lift your ass even
one inch off this seat,

951
01:16:59,151 --> 01:17:02,218
I'll put a bullet right
in your goddamn throat.

952
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:29,146
So domergue,

953
01:17:29,429 --> 01:17:34,301
I suppose this blizzard counts as a stroke
of luck as far as you're concerned?

954
01:17:34,559 --> 01:17:38,451
- You don't hear me complaining do ya'?
- No I sure don't.

955
01:17:46,417 --> 01:17:49,485
How 'bout you oswaldo?

956
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:52,347
How about me what?

957
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,151
Look,

958
01:17:54,271 --> 01:17:57,246
considerin' all the thing I done
for money, I ain't one to judge.

959
01:17:57,366 --> 01:18:03,045
But don't you feel just the least
little bad 'bout hangin' a woman?

960
01:18:03,165 --> 01:18:06,467
Till they invent a trigger
a woman can't pull, if

961
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:09,594
you're a hang man, you're
going to hang woman.

962
01:18:09,714 --> 01:18:12,687
Well hell ozzy, I guess I ain't never
looked at it like that before.

963
01:18:12,807 --> 01:18:15,234
When it comes to some
of them mean bastards

964
01:18:15,246 --> 01:18:17,740
out therem it's the only
thing does the job.

965
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:23,836
You really only need to hang mean bastards.
But mean bastards, you need to hang.

966
01:18:32,627 --> 01:18:35,088
You goddamn son of a bitch!

967
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:38,645
I almost died out there!

968
01:18:41,829 --> 01:18:47,951
I ain't never going out in that shit
ever, ever again!

969
01:19:10,649 --> 01:19:12,182
You okay, o.B.?

970
01:19:12,302 --> 01:19:13,897
I'm fine.

971
01:19:14,017 --> 01:19:15,817
I'll be fine.

972
01:19:15,937 --> 01:19:18,563
I just need to get warm.

973
01:19:23,486 --> 01:19:25,561
You want some stew, o.B.?

974
01:19:25,681 --> 01:19:28,500
Stew, later.

975
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:35,859
That's nice.

976
01:20:00,298 --> 01:20:01,368
So...

977
01:20:02,502 --> 01:20:04,126
How you doin', black major?

978
01:20:04,246 --> 01:20:09,793
I ain't in the mood, Chris mannix.
Leave me be from your horseshit.

979
01:20:09,913 --> 01:20:11,769
John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln letter?

980
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:15,166
I tole' you jackass to
hee-haw somewhere else.

981
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:16,654
That's right, John.

982
01:20:16,774 --> 01:20:20,701
- You did say, didn't ya'?
- Yeah I did.

983
01:20:21,913 --> 01:20:23,421
So...

984
01:20:25,032 --> 01:20:28,848
- You got a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
- Yes.

985
01:20:29,144 --> 01:20:32,238
Thee Abraham Lincoln?

986
01:20:32,358 --> 01:20:33,631
Yes.

987
01:20:33,643 --> 01:20:37,496
Abraham Lincoln the president
of the United States...

988
01:20:37,754 --> 01:20:41,157
- Yes.
- Of America? - Yes.

989
01:20:41,277 --> 01:20:45,720
- Wrote you a letter, personally?
- Yes.

990
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:50,695
- Personally? As in: "Dear maj. Warren"?
- No. Personally as in: "Dear marquis".

991
01:20:50,815 --> 01:20:55,566
"Dear marquis" Abraham Lincoln the
president of the United States of America?

992
01:20:55,578 --> 01:20:57,166
Yes.

993
01:20:57,286 --> 01:21:00,646
- May I see it?
- No you may not.

994
01:21:00,766 --> 01:21:03,910
But the way John tells it,
you weren't just some

995
01:21:03,922 --> 01:21:07,335
random nigger soldier picked
from a pile of letters.

996
01:21:07,455 --> 01:21:09,526
Way John tells it,

997
01:21:09,797 --> 01:21:13,509
- y'all hada' correspondence.
- Yes.

998
01:21:13,947 --> 01:21:19,013
Way John tells it, y'all's
practically pen pals?

999
01:21:20,186 --> 01:21:21,186
Yes.

1000
01:21:22,686 --> 01:21:24,981
And a pen pal's...

1001
01:21:25,419 --> 01:21:28,164
Practically a friend.

1002
01:21:38,902 --> 01:21:41,029
John Ruth,

1003
01:21:41,149 --> 01:21:43,878
you really think a nigger
drummed outta' the

1004
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:46,571
calvary with a yellow
stripe down his back,

1005
01:21:46,691 --> 01:21:50,412
was practically friends with the president
of the United States of America?

1006
01:21:54,253 --> 01:21:59,003
John Ruth, I hate to be the one to break it
to ya' but nobody in minnie's haberdashery,

1007
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:02,219
had ever corresponded with Abraham Lincoln,

1008
01:22:02,339 --> 01:22:05,969
least of all, that nigger there.

1009
01:22:15,584 --> 01:22:18,136
Was all that horseshit?

1010
01:22:20,837 --> 01:22:23,963
Course it was.

1011
01:22:48,837 --> 01:22:51,969
Well I guess it's true
what they say about you people.

1012
01:22:54,598 --> 01:22:58,220
You can't trust a fuckin' word
that comes outta' your mouth.

1013
01:22:59,419 --> 01:23:01,958
What's the matter, John Ruth?

1014
01:23:02,078 --> 01:23:04,342
I hurt your feelings?

1015
01:23:04,462 --> 01:23:07,874
As a matter of fact, you did.

1016
01:23:11,393 --> 01:23:13,017
I know,

1017
01:23:13,137 --> 01:23:17,979
I'm the only black son of a bitch you ever
met, so I'm gonna' cut you some slack.

1018
01:23:18,099 --> 01:23:23,173
But you got no idea, what it's like
being a black man facin' down America.

1019
01:23:23,961 --> 01:23:26,241
The only time black folks are safe,

1020
01:23:26,361 --> 01:23:29,851
is when white folks is disarmed.
And this letter,

1021
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:34,774
had the desired effect of
disarming white folks.

1022
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:38,887
Call it what you want,

1023
01:23:40,677 --> 01:23:43,810
I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.

1024
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:56,492
You wanna' know why I'd lie
about something like that, white man?

1025
01:24:02,074 --> 01:24:04,884
Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it.

1026
01:24:11,831 --> 01:24:14,731
Well I'll tell you like
the lord tole' John,

1027
01:24:14,851 --> 01:24:19,075
a letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't
have that kinda' effect on me.

1028
01:24:19,195 --> 01:24:22,684
- I might let a whore piss on it.
- I spit on it.

1029
01:24:22,804 --> 01:24:25,481
Good for you, sister.

1030
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:45,634
Warren goddamit,
you leave that old man alone!

1031
01:24:45,754 --> 01:24:50,433
Stand down you son of a bitch,
I shared a battle field with this man.

1032
01:24:50,553 --> 01:24:53,011
Or would you deny me that too?

1033
01:24:56,813 --> 01:24:59,559
I suppose you were there.

1034
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:02,653
May I join you?

1035
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:08,570
Yes you may.

1036
01:25:58,477 --> 01:25:59,598
Damn it.

1037
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,855
So,

1038
01:26:07,138 --> 01:26:09,252
how's life since the war?

1039
01:26:14,665 --> 01:26:17,050
Got both my legs.

1040
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:20,298
Got both my arms.

1041
01:26:20,724 --> 01:26:24,990
- I can't complain.
- Got a woman?

1042
01:26:26,885 --> 01:26:30,236
Fever took her, started this last winter.

1043
01:26:31,112 --> 01:26:33,007
What was her name?

1044
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:37,016
- Betsy.
- Georgia girl?

1045
01:26:38,498 --> 01:26:40,251
Augusta.

1046
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:44,620
Atlanta boy, and a Augusta girl.

1047
01:26:46,115 --> 01:26:48,938
I use to raise Kentucky horses.

1048
01:26:49,058 --> 01:26:54,133
Her paw' was the owner of the breedershit
where I brought of my ponies.

1049
01:26:56,402 --> 01:26:57,678
God damnit.

1050
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:00,810
I made good deal on her.

1051
01:27:01,377 --> 01:27:05,192
Took the stake he gave and
bought a bunch peach ochards.

1052
01:27:05,502 --> 01:27:07,577
Set myself up pretty well.

1053
01:27:08,105 --> 01:27:12,565
Did a hellva' lot better than
my no good brothers, that's for damn sure.

1054
01:27:15,065 --> 01:27:18,662
Yeah, your son came up
here a few years back.

1055
01:27:18,971 --> 01:27:21,613
He spoke highly of his mama too.

1056
01:27:22,709 --> 01:27:27,052
You knew my boy?

1057
01:27:27,915 --> 01:27:29,308
Yeah...

1058
01:27:30,751 --> 01:27:33,110
Yeah I knew 'em.

1059
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:35,572
You did not know my boy.

1060
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:41,926
Suit yourself.

1061
01:27:43,369 --> 01:27:46,475
Didja' know my son?

1062
01:27:46,733 --> 01:27:52,095
I know the day he died, - do you?
No.

1063
01:27:52,215 --> 01:27:55,279
You wanna know what day that was?

1064
01:27:59,377 --> 01:28:04,301
The day he met me.

1065
01:28:19,665 --> 01:28:23,068
He came up here to
do a little nigger head huntin'.

1066
01:28:23,188 --> 01:28:28,727
By then the reward was so,
five thousand and bragging rights.

1067
01:28:28,847 --> 01:28:33,676
But back then to battle hard rebs, five
thousand just to cut off a niggers head,

1068
01:28:34,864 --> 01:28:37,711
now that's good money.

1069
01:28:37,831 --> 01:28:43,008
So the Johnny's climbed this mountain,
lookin' for fortune.

1070
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:47,145
But there was no fortune to be found.

1071
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:51,593
All they found was me.

1072
01:28:53,385 --> 01:28:56,368
All them fella's came up
here sang a different tune,

1073
01:28:56,488 --> 01:29:00,492
when they found
themselves at the mercy of a nigger's gun,

1074
01:29:03,155 --> 01:29:07,988
"let's just forget it.
I go my way, you go yours"

1075
01:29:08,298 --> 01:29:12,667
- that's your boy Chester talkin'
- you a goddamn lie.

1076
01:29:12,787 --> 01:29:16,686
"If you just let me
home to my family, I'll

1077
01:29:16,698 --> 01:29:20,787
swear, I'll never set
foot in Wyoming again."

1078
01:29:22,862 --> 01:29:26,304
That's what they all said.

1079
01:29:28,366 --> 01:29:30,841
Beggin' for his life.

1080
01:29:30,961 --> 01:29:36,757
Your boy told me his whole life story.

1081
01:29:38,948 --> 01:29:42,827
And you was in that story, general.

1082
01:29:43,871 --> 01:29:47,983
And when I knew me I had the son.

1083
01:29:48,103 --> 01:29:53,083
Of the bloody nigger
killer of Baton Rouge...

1084
01:29:53,203 --> 01:29:58,359
- I knew me I was gonna' have some fun.
- You shut your lyin' nigger lips up!

1085
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:02,535
General smithers, don't you listen to him,
he didn't know your boy!

1086
01:30:02,655 --> 01:30:05,731
He just heard,
tell why you here is all!

1087
01:30:05,851 --> 01:30:09,559
It was cold the day I killed your boy.

1088
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:15,781
And I don't mean snwoy mountain in
Wyoming cold. It was colder than that.

1089
01:30:15,901 --> 01:30:18,208
And on that cold day,

1090
01:30:18,328 --> 01:30:23,055
with your boy at the
business end of my gun barrel...

1091
01:30:23,175 --> 01:30:25,414
I made him strip.

1092
01:30:25,534 --> 01:30:29,886
Right down to his bare ass.

1093
01:30:31,136 --> 01:30:34,552
Then I told him to start walkin'.

1094
01:31:02,534 --> 01:31:07,200
I walked his naked ass for two hours,
'fore his cold collapsed him.

1095
01:31:09,481 --> 01:31:13,541
- You never even knew my boy?
- No he didn't!

1096
01:31:13,661 --> 01:31:18,113
He's just a sneaky nigger
tryin' to getcha to go for that gun!

1097
01:31:18,233 --> 01:31:21,687
Then he commits to begging again.

1098
01:31:21,807 --> 01:31:26,199
But this time he wasn't begging to go home.

1099
01:31:26,508 --> 01:31:31,238
He knew he'd never see his home again.
And he wasn't beggin' for his life neither.

1100
01:31:31,358 --> 01:31:34,887
'Cos he knew that was long gone.

1101
01:31:35,007 --> 01:31:40,622
All he wanted... was a blanket.

1102
01:31:40,742 --> 01:31:44,486
Now don't judge your boy
too harshly, general. You

1103
01:31:44,498 --> 01:31:48,034
ain't never been cold as
your boy was that day.

1104
01:31:49,839 --> 01:31:57,482
You'd be surprised what a man that cold,
would do for a blanket.

1105
01:31:58,964 --> 01:32:01,529
Wanna know what your boy did?

1106
01:32:03,681 --> 01:32:08,669
I took my big, black,
pecker outta' my pants.

1107
01:32:09,726 --> 01:32:14,921
And I made him crawl through
the snow on all fours over to it.

1108
01:32:23,363 --> 01:32:28,506
Then I grabbed a hand full
of that black hair on the back his head...

1109
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:38,147
Then I stuck my big, black Johnson
right down his goddamn throat.

1110
01:32:39,165 --> 01:32:41,988
And it was fulla' blood, so it was warm.

1111
01:32:43,367 --> 01:32:47,428
You bet your sweet ass it was warm.

1112
01:32:47,548 --> 01:32:51,037
And Chester Charles smithers,

1113
01:32:51,157 --> 01:32:57,739
sucked on that warm black dingus
for long as he could.

1114
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:11,246
Starting to see pictures, ain't ya'?

1115
01:33:11,366 --> 01:33:13,064
Your boy...

1116
01:33:13,184 --> 01:33:15,448
Black dudes dingus in his mouth.

1117
01:33:15,568 --> 01:33:19,109
Him shakin', him cryin'

1118
01:33:19,229 --> 01:33:22,886
me laughin'

1119
01:33:24,652 --> 01:33:28,003
and him not understandin'

1120
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:33,030
but you understand, doncha' Sandy?

1121
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:36,020
I never did give your boy that blanket.

1122
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:43,519
Even after all he did,
and he did everything I asked.

1123
01:33:44,875 --> 01:33:46,228
No blanket.

1124
01:33:47,672 --> 01:33:51,681
That blanket was just
a heart breakin' liar's promise.

1125
01:33:51,801 --> 01:33:55,470
Kinda' like those uniforms
the union issued those colored troopers,

1126
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:59,311
that you chose not to acknowledge.

1127
01:34:05,626 --> 01:34:08,114
So what you gonna' do old man?

1128
01:34:09,647 --> 01:34:12,844
You gonna' spend the
next two or three days,

1129
01:34:12,964 --> 01:34:17,016
ignore the nigger that killed your boy,

1130
01:34:17,136 --> 01:34:21,218
ignoring how I made him suffer?

1131
01:34:21,338 --> 01:34:24,521
Ignoring how I made him...

1132
01:34:24,998 --> 01:34:29,754
Lick, all over my Johnson?

1133
01:34:31,004 --> 01:34:34,755
The dumbest thing your boy ever did...

1134
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:40,156
Was to let me know...
He was your boy.

1135
01:35:08,228 --> 01:35:13,668
Chapter four
domergue's got a secret

1136
01:35:20,829 --> 01:35:24,853
about fifteen minutes has passed,
since we last left our characters.

1137
01:35:25,444 --> 01:35:29,461
Joe gag volunteered
to take smithers dead body outside.

1138
01:35:29,581 --> 01:35:32,426
Straws we drawn to see
who would help him...

1139
01:35:32,546 --> 01:35:35,506
O.B. Lost.

1140
01:35:35,626 --> 01:35:36,846
Chris, John Ruth and oswaldo,

1141
01:35:36,966 --> 01:35:42,422
had vigorous debate about the legality of
self-defense murder they just transpired.

1142
01:35:42,542 --> 01:35:45,216
Marquis Warren who is
supremely confident about the

1143
01:35:45,228 --> 01:35:47,655
legality of what just
transpired, ignored them

1144
01:35:47,775 --> 01:35:50,894
sat at a table by himself
and drank Brandy.

1145
01:35:53,624 --> 01:35:56,280
Captain Chris mannix dawn
the dead generals coat and

1146
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:58,960
joined oswaldo in lighting
the candles and lanterns.

1147
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:03,131
Hey ozzy,
hey you got the right idea.

1148
01:36:03,251 --> 01:36:05,708
Let's light this place up.

1149
01:36:05,828 --> 01:36:10,371
John Ruth held the door close,
waiting for Joe gage and o.B. To return.

1150
01:36:14,932 --> 01:36:18,477
Bob enjoyed an manzana roja.

1151
01:36:23,693 --> 01:36:25,687
Domergue, however,

1152
01:36:25,807 --> 01:36:29,916
hasn't moved from her spot at the community
dinner table since John Ruth uncuffed her.

1153
01:36:30,036 --> 01:36:31,154
John Ruth...

1154
01:36:32,534 --> 01:36:33,615
Yeah?

1155
01:36:34,648 --> 01:36:36,864
Can I play that guitar over there?

1156
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:39,092
Let's go back a bit.

1157
01:36:39,644 --> 01:36:43,350
Your boy, black dudes dingus in his mouth.

1158
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:48,425
Fifteen minutes ago major Warren shot
general smithers in front of everybody.

1159
01:36:48,545 --> 01:36:51,931
But fourty seconds before
that, something equally

1160
01:36:51,943 --> 01:36:55,273
as important happened, but
not everybody saw it.

1161
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,160
While major Warren was
captivating the crowd

1162
01:36:58,172 --> 01:37:01,012
with tales of black dicks
and white mouths...

1163
01:37:01,132 --> 01:37:05,221
Somebody... poisoned the coffy.

1164
01:37:05,341 --> 01:37:10,101
He did everything I asked, no blanket.

1165
01:37:11,545 --> 01:37:14,794
And the only one to see 'em do it...

1166
01:37:18,735 --> 01:37:20,698
Was domergue.

1167
01:37:25,542 --> 01:37:28,966
That's why this chapter is called...

1168
01:37:29,086 --> 01:37:31,664
Domergue's got a secret.

1169
01:37:34,384 --> 01:37:36,305
John Ruth.

1170
01:37:36,861 --> 01:37:38,191
Yeah.

1171
01:37:38,956 --> 01:37:41,687
Can I play that guitar over there?

1172
01:37:47,313 --> 01:37:48,345
Yeah.

1173
01:37:54,684 --> 01:37:57,584
You come back with anything
else but a guitar.

1174
01:37:57,704 --> 01:38:00,363
My pistol plays a tune.

1175
01:38:00,483 --> 01:38:04,451
Domergues death march, you got it?

1176
01:38:04,571 --> 01:38:08,359
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it.

1177
01:41:03,732 --> 01:41:08,089
That's the one you like to sing
in the stagecoach, huh?

1178
01:41:08,209 --> 01:41:09,377
Yeah.

1179
01:41:09,497 --> 01:41:11,659
It's kinda' pretty.

1180
01:41:12,329 --> 01:41:15,784
- Got another verse to it?
- Yeah I got.

1181
01:41:18,785 --> 01:41:20,624
Go ahead, sing it.

1182
01:42:07,658 --> 01:42:09,804
Gimme that guitar!

1183
01:42:12,568 --> 01:42:14,354
Music time's over!

1184
01:42:18,988 --> 01:42:20,813
Turn around.

1185
01:42:28,236 --> 01:42:31,760
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up!

1186
01:44:16,709 --> 01:44:20,315
When you get to hell, John.

1187
01:44:20,435 --> 01:44:22,972
Tell 'em Daisy sent ya'.

1188
01:44:36,024 --> 01:44:38,883
Mannix the coffy!

1189
01:45:33,059 --> 01:45:34,529
Oh my god!

1190
01:45:38,215 --> 01:45:40,349
Gimme that fucking gun!

1191
01:45:41,195 --> 01:45:43,854
Don't test me, bitch.

1192
01:45:46,573 --> 01:45:51,850
Everybody get your back sides up
against that back wall over yonder.

1193
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:54,488
Goddammit-

1194
01:45:54,608 --> 01:45:57,468
get or don't get, Joe gage.
It's up to you.

1195
01:45:57,588 --> 01:45:59,920
- I'll get.
- Then get.

1196
01:46:12,464 --> 01:46:14,909
You too, senor Bob.

1197
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:23,097
Everybody turn around
and put your hands on that wall.

1198
01:46:26,984 --> 01:46:29,260
Move 'em down snowshoes.

1199
01:46:50,166 --> 01:46:54,194
Everybody keep your mouth
shut and do like I say.

1200
01:46:54,314 --> 01:46:57,617
You open your mouth; You
gonna' get a bullet.

1201
01:46:57,737 --> 01:47:02,894
You move a little sudden, a little strange;
You gonna' get a bullet.

1202
01:47:03,014 --> 01:47:07,264
Not a warning, not a question;
A bullet.

1203
01:47:07,384 --> 01:47:09,661
You got that?

1204
01:47:09,781 --> 01:47:11,876
- Let me hear you say, "I got it".
- "I got it".

1205
01:47:11,996 --> 01:47:15,336
- "I got it" - "I got it".
- We have it.

1206
01:47:16,891 --> 01:47:20,576
Chris mannix,
come over here on this side.

1207
01:47:20,696 --> 01:47:22,389
Come on.

1208
01:47:27,687 --> 01:47:30,223
Take this gun out of my holster.

1209
01:47:40,112 --> 01:47:41,864
Point it at them.

1210
01:47:44,165 --> 01:47:49,989
Like I said, anybody does anything.
And I mean, anything.

1211
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:52,557
Kill 'em.

1212
01:47:56,485 --> 01:47:58,349
So...

1213
01:47:58,469 --> 01:48:04,138
You finally decided I'm tellin' the truth
'bout bein' the sheriff of red rock, huh?

1214
01:48:04,258 --> 01:48:06,353
I don't know 'bout all that.

1215
01:48:06,473 --> 01:48:09,345
But you ain't the killer
who poisoned that coffy.

1216
01:48:09,357 --> 01:48:11,952
'Cos you almost drunk
it your own damn self.

1217
01:48:12,072 --> 01:48:15,255
But one of 'em is.

1218
01:48:21,456 --> 01:48:22,677
Gimme the key.

1219
01:48:22,797 --> 01:48:24,801
Gimme the key!

1220
01:48:36,803 --> 01:48:40,086
You motherfucking black bastard!

1221
01:48:40,206 --> 01:48:45,066
You're gonna' die on this mountain
and I'm gonna' fucking laugh when you do!

1222
01:48:47,275 --> 01:48:48,812
What I say 'bout talkin?

1223
01:48:49,921 --> 01:48:52,009
'Meant it, didn't I?

1224
01:48:53,118 --> 01:48:56,716
And you need to understand,
you just killed the only

1225
01:48:56,728 --> 01:49:00,337
man here, comitted to gettin'
you to red rock alive.

1226
01:49:06,066 --> 01:49:11,222
Now, one of y'all...
Is workin' with her.

1227
01:49:11,342 --> 01:49:14,162
Or two of y'all is workin' with her.

1228
01:49:14,282 --> 01:49:16,472
Or all y'all is...

1229
01:49:19,079 --> 01:49:22,146
But only one of you poisoned the coffy.

1230
01:49:25,984 --> 01:49:32,006
So what charms this bitch got,
take a man brave a blizzard,

1231
01:49:32,126 --> 01:49:39,246
kill in cold blood, I'm
sure I don't know.

1232
01:49:41,472 --> 01:49:44,755
But John Ruth's trying to hang your woman,

1233
01:49:44,875 --> 01:49:50,695
so you kill him... okay-maybe.

1234
01:49:50,815 --> 01:49:53,817
But o.B. Wasn't hangin' nobody.

1235
01:49:53,937 --> 01:49:55,293
He damn sure would.

1236
01:49:55,413 --> 01:49:57,623
But he sure enough led over there
dead now, though, ain't he?

1237
01:49:57,743 --> 01:50:00,053
He damn sure is you
sons of bitches.

1238
01:50:00,065 --> 01:50:03,041
Just like any one of us
who'd drank that coffy.

1239
01:50:03,161 --> 01:50:06,465
Like me god damnit.

1240
01:50:06,585 --> 01:50:10,022
Now those of y'all with
your hands on the wall

1241
01:50:10,034 --> 01:50:13,777
don't practice in poison
need to think about that.

1242
01:50:13,897 --> 01:50:18,126
Think about how that coulda' you
been you rollin' around on this floor.

1243
01:50:18,246 --> 01:50:21,751
And about the men standin' next
ta' ya' would be responsible.

1244
01:50:21,871 --> 01:50:29,303
And I know who I got my money on. Yeah
that's right Joe gage I'm lookin' at you.

1245
01:50:30,692 --> 01:50:35,324
Not so fast Chris.
We'll get there.

1246
01:50:35,444 --> 01:50:38,527
Let's slow it down.

1247
01:50:38,647 --> 01:50:41,628
Let's slow it way down.

1248
01:50:46,825 --> 01:50:48,919
Who made the coffy?

1249
01:50:49,039 --> 01:50:50,588
He did.

1250
01:50:52,363 --> 01:50:56,773
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?

1251
01:50:56,893 --> 01:51:01,707
But it's the stew that's got me thinking.

1252
01:51:01,827 --> 01:51:04,770
How long you say minnie been gone?

1253
01:51:04,890 --> 01:51:06,781
A week?

1254
01:51:07,367 --> 01:51:09,361
Si.

1255
01:51:09,481 --> 01:51:14,577
See, my mama used to make stew.

1256
01:51:14,697 --> 01:51:18,183
And it always tasted the same,
no matter the meat.

1257
01:51:18,303 --> 01:51:21,465
And there was another fellow
on the plantation, uncle charly.

1258
01:51:21,585 --> 01:51:25,151
He made stew too
and like my mama's.

1259
01:51:25,271 --> 01:51:29,440
I ate his stew from the
time I was a whipper,

1260
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:33,166
to I was a full grown man.

1261
01:51:33,286 --> 01:51:38,946
And no matter the meat,
it always tasted like uncle charly's stew.

1262
01:51:39,066 --> 01:51:44,806
Now I ain't had minnie's stew in six
months, so I ain't no expert, but that,

1263
01:51:44,926 --> 01:51:50,104
damn sure is minnie's stew.

1264
01:51:50,224 --> 01:51:55,098
So if minnie's on the north side
visiting her mama for a week,

1265
01:51:55,218 --> 01:51:59,751
how'd she make the stew this morning?

1266
01:52:02,368 --> 01:52:04,422
And this?

1267
01:52:04,725 --> 01:52:09,014
This... is sweet Dave's chair.

1268
01:52:09,134 --> 01:52:12,679
When I sat in it earlier,
I couldn't belive it.

1269
01:52:12,799 --> 01:52:15,781
Nobody sits in sweet Dave's chaire.

1270
01:52:15,901 --> 01:52:21,339
This may be minnie's place,
but this is damn sure,

1271
01:52:21,459 --> 01:52:24,763
sweet Dave's chair.

1272
01:52:25,690 --> 01:52:30,544
And if... he went to
the north side...

1273
01:52:30,846 --> 01:52:38,056
I'm pretty goddamn sure
that chair's be going with him.

1274
01:52:40,110 --> 01:52:42,084
What's in the chair?

1275
01:52:42,204 --> 01:52:44,581
Just what I thought.

1276
01:52:44,701 --> 01:52:47,984
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.

1277
01:52:53,242 --> 01:52:54,994
So...

1278
01:52:55,114 --> 01:52:58,619
Are you actually accusing me of murder?

1279
01:53:01,216 --> 01:53:04,157
The way I see it, senior Bob,

1280
01:53:04,277 --> 01:53:07,520
whoever's workin' with her,

1281
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:12,072
ain't who they say they is.
And if it's you,

1282
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:16,140
that means minnie
and her man ain't at her mama's.

1283
01:53:16,260 --> 01:53:19,846
They're lyin' out back
there dead somewhere.

1284
01:53:19,966 --> 01:53:22,142
Or if it's you britisch man,

1285
01:53:22,262 --> 01:53:25,068
the real oswaldo mobray is lyin'
in a ditch somewhere. And

1286
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:27,660
you're just an English fella'
passin' off his papers.

1287
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:33,743
Or we go by my theory, which
is the ugliest guy did it.

1288
01:53:33,863 --> 01:53:37,247
Which makes it you, Joe gage.

1289
01:53:37,367 --> 01:53:40,843
So I take it you've
deduced the coffy was

1290
01:53:40,855 --> 01:53:44,759
poisoned while you were
murdering the old man?

1291
01:53:44,879 --> 01:53:46,571
Yes.

1292
01:53:46,691 --> 01:53:51,284
Well, mi negro amigo,
during that whole incident...

1293
01:53:51,404 --> 01:53:56,097
I was sitting on that side of the room.
Playing silent night on the piano.

1294
01:53:56,217 --> 01:54:02,783
I didn't say you poisoned the coffy.
I said you didn't make the stew.

1295
01:54:03,730 --> 01:54:06,771
My theory is...

1296
01:54:06,891 --> 01:54:11,927
You're working with man
who poisoned the coffy.

1297
01:54:12,047 --> 01:54:14,534
And both of y'all murdered minnie,

1298
01:54:14,654 --> 01:54:17,652
and sweet Dave and whoever
else picked this bad luck

1299
01:54:17,664 --> 01:54:20,446
day to visit minnie's
haberdashery this morning.

1300
01:54:20,566 --> 01:54:28,566
And at some point, y'all intented
to bushwhack John Ruth and free Daisy.

1301
01:54:30,051 --> 01:54:38,051
But you didn't count on the blizzard
and you didn't count on the two of us.

1302
01:54:40,384 --> 01:54:42,881
That's as far as I got.
How am I doin'?

1303
01:54:46,043 --> 01:54:50,896
Your a real imaginative nigger, ain't you?

1304
01:54:51,016 --> 01:54:56,575
So, do you intend to murder me
based on a far fetched nigger theory?

1305
01:54:56,695 --> 01:54:58,066
Or can you prove it, cabrone?

1306
01:55:00,563 --> 01:55:05,235
It ain't so far fetched, senior Bob.

1307
01:55:05,355 --> 01:55:09,606
And it's a little bit more then my theory.

1308
01:55:13,089 --> 01:55:15,949
How long you say you been
working for minnie's?

1309
01:55:16,069 --> 01:55:19,151
Four months.

1310
01:55:19,533 --> 01:55:22,563
If you would have been here
two and half years ago

1311
01:55:22,575 --> 01:55:25,676
you'd know about the sign
usta' hang above the bar.

1312
01:55:25,978 --> 01:55:31,678
- Minnie mentioned that to you?
- No.

1313
01:55:32,161 --> 01:55:35,685
You know what that sign said, senior Bob?

1314
01:55:36,793 --> 01:55:40,277
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed"

1315
01:55:44,345 --> 01:55:47,898
minnie hung that sign up the
day she opened this habadashery.

1316
01:55:48,018 --> 01:55:51,008
And it hung over that
bar every day till she

1317
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:53,689
took down, a little
over two years ago.

1318
01:55:56,468 --> 01:55:59,409
You know why she took it down?

1319
01:55:59,529 --> 01:56:02,067
She started lettin' in dogs.

1320
01:56:05,652 --> 01:56:13,652
Now minnie likes just about everybody,
but she sure don't like Mexicans.

1321
01:56:14,231 --> 01:56:19,609
So when you tell me, minnie went
to north side to visit her mama?

1322
01:56:19,729 --> 01:56:25,934
Well I find that highly
unlikely... but okay - maybe.

1323
01:56:26,236 --> 01:56:30,375
But when you tell me minnie
mink took the habadashery,

1324
01:56:30,387 --> 01:56:34,236
the most precious thing to
her in the whole world,

1325
01:56:36,748 --> 01:56:41,783
and left it in hands of a goddamn Mexican?

1326
01:56:41,903 --> 01:56:48,087
Well that's what I meant in the barn when I
said: "That sure don't sound like minnie".

1327
01:56:48,207 --> 01:56:54,652
Now I am calling you a liar, senior Bob.

1328
01:56:54,772 --> 01:56:59,787
And if you lyin, which you are,

1329
01:56:59,907 --> 01:57:04,443
then you killed minnie -
and sweet Dave.

1330
01:57:22,122 --> 01:57:27,419
Four measly bulltes and
there goes senior, Bob.

1331
01:57:28,728 --> 01:57:31,971
That still don't get us no closer...

1332
01:57:32,091 --> 01:57:35,190
To which one of y'all
poisoned the coffy, though.

1333
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:38,657
- Does it Chris?
- No it sure don't.

1334
01:57:44,477 --> 01:57:48,726
Now one of y'all poisoned this coffy,
to free Daisy.

1335
01:57:48,846 --> 01:57:51,397
If I don't hear a
confession from one of you

1336
01:57:51,409 --> 01:57:53,801
motherfuckers quick,
fast and in a hurry,

1337
01:57:53,921 --> 01:57:59,319
I'm gonna' pull this whole pot of coffy,
down that bitches goddamn throat.

1338
01:58:00,427 --> 01:58:03,790
Okay, time's up.

1339
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:09,812
Stop! Alright I did it,
it was me I poisoned the coffy.

1340
01:58:09,932 --> 01:58:13,094
I fuckin' knew it!

1341
01:58:14,604 --> 01:58:17,044
You gonna' die now you murderin' bastard.

1342
01:58:17,164 --> 01:58:22,418
Major Warren please let me
sent this ugly son of a bitch to hell.

1343
01:58:22,538 --> 01:58:27,554
You killed o.B. He's worth ten of you!
Warren can I kill him?

1344
01:58:27,674 --> 01:58:29,809
Say adios to your huevos.

1345
01:58:36,670 --> 01:58:40,502
Major Warren?

1346
01:58:57,359 --> 01:59:02,535
I ain't got no gun, sheriff.

1347
01:59:34,456 --> 01:59:42,456
Chapter five the four passengers

1348
02:00:00,779 --> 02:00:04,384
earlier that morning.

1349
02:01:56,392 --> 02:02:00,420
- Hey charly my, how the hell are you?
- Hi ya' Ed, hi ya' Judy-

1350
02:02:04,102 --> 02:02:06,808
- how many ya' got?
- Full house today, friend.

1351
02:02:06,928 --> 02:02:07,930
We got on in there waiting.

1352
02:02:07,942 --> 02:02:10,388
Well he's gonna' hafta keep on
waitin' cause we ain't got no room.

1353
02:02:10,508 --> 02:02:12,732
Well you need to tell minnie.
Cause he's been

1354
02:02:12,744 --> 02:02:15,028
here two days and minnie
wants him outta here.

1355
02:02:15,148 --> 02:02:17,426
Well I can't give him a seat I don't have -

1356
02:02:17,546 --> 02:02:20,895
listen why don't you take the passengers
inside, introduce them to minnie.

1357
02:02:21,015 --> 02:02:23,537
- Warm youself up and drink some coffy.
- Okay.

1358
02:02:29,554 --> 02:02:32,475
Here we are everybody,
minnie's haberdashery.

1359
02:02:32,595 --> 02:02:34,472
Step outside you and
your friends can stretch

1360
02:02:34,484 --> 02:02:36,372
your legs. When you're
reday, stop on inside,

1361
02:02:36,492 --> 02:02:41,373
get warm by the fire, get some coffy
in you. I'll introduve you to minnie.

1362
02:02:43,527 --> 02:02:45,818
Hi minnie!

1363
02:03:05,038 --> 02:03:07,187
I'm not trying to tell
you how to run your business.

1364
02:03:07,307 --> 02:03:10,213
But I would think coffy
would be the first thing you'd make.

1365
02:03:10,333 --> 02:03:13,002
- Come on in everybody, don't be shy.
- Hats!

1366
02:03:13,122 --> 02:03:16,330
Everybody, this is minnie,
and this is her place.

1367
02:03:16,450 --> 02:03:19,351
Behind me pluckin' that chicken is Gemma.

1368
02:03:20,295 --> 02:03:22,340
Lovley smile, that Gemma.

1369
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:24,682
Now the fella' in the
uniform I don't know but

1370
02:03:24,694 --> 02:03:26,928
the one he's playing chess
with is sweet Dave.

1371
02:03:27,048 --> 02:03:30,352
- Hi ya' Dave.
- Hey Judy.

1372
02:03:30,472 --> 02:03:33,272
And minnie, these are the passengers.

1373
02:03:33,392 --> 02:03:35,815
Well that's not good enough.

1374
02:03:35,935 --> 02:03:39,893
Go take away them rags,
let's see some faces let's hear some names.

1375
02:03:40,013 --> 02:03:42,788
Oswaldo mobray, madame.

1376
02:03:42,908 --> 02:03:44,324
Joe gage.

1377
02:03:44,444 --> 02:03:45,910
Bob.

1378
02:03:46,030 --> 02:03:47,723
And I'm Jody.

1379
02:03:47,843 --> 02:03:50,301
It's a pleasant surprise
to find such a warm

1380
02:03:50,313 --> 02:03:52,783
sanctuary in the middle
of such a cold hell.

1381
02:03:52,903 --> 02:03:56,660
Well make yourself comfortable.
Get warm by the fire.

1382
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:59,760
We're just gonna' go warm ourself's
by the stove, if that's all right?

1383
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:02,677
Stove, fireplace, whatever.
Just get warm.

1384
02:04:02,797 --> 02:04:05,964
Oh, and Judy said something
about the best coffy in the world?

1385
02:04:06,084 --> 02:04:10,280
Yes I do belive Judy did say something
about the best coffy in the world.

1386
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:13,446
Well I don't know 'bout all that.
But I'll tell ya what it is.

1387
02:04:13,566 --> 02:04:15,911
It's hot and it's strong
and it's good. And

1388
02:04:15,923 --> 02:04:18,387
in this snow it sure
'nuff warms your ass up.

1389
02:04:18,507 --> 02:04:20,856
You don't need to sell it,
minnie, you need make it.

1390
02:04:20,976 --> 02:04:22,673
And you need to get
your ass out there and

1391
02:04:22,685 --> 02:04:24,553
help charly with them
bags and get Ed in here.

1392
02:04:24,673 --> 02:04:29,115
- Yes, ma'am, but fix the coffy.
- I'll fix you!

1393
02:04:31,319 --> 02:04:32,565
I don't know some old man.

1394
02:04:32,577 --> 02:04:35,002
Well I don't know what I'm
suppose to do about it.

1395
02:04:35,122 --> 02:04:37,153
I'm just tellin' you what she said.

1396
02:04:37,273 --> 02:04:41,672
Anyway she sent me out here
to help charly, she wants to talk to you.

1397
02:04:41,792 --> 02:04:45,423
Got 'em, Ed.

1398
02:05:01,283 --> 02:05:04,732
Miss minnie?
Would you roll me a cigarette?

1399
02:05:04,852 --> 02:05:08,483
Sure honey,
I smoke red apple tobacco, that all right?

1400
02:05:08,603 --> 02:05:10,724
It's my favorite.

1401
02:05:13,769 --> 02:05:18,930
Don't mind me gentlemen,
I'm just watching.

1402
02:05:19,333 --> 02:05:20,969
You play?

1403
02:05:21,910 --> 02:05:26,306
You know,
I must of had at least twelve people,

1404
02:05:26,426 --> 02:05:33,129
teach me that goddamn game.
Just never could keep the moves in my head.

1405
02:05:33,249 --> 02:05:36,695
But if I'm not disturbing,
I like to watch?

1406
02:05:36,815 --> 02:05:40,153
Hell no. I like whippin' this
old man's ass in front of a audience,

1407
02:05:40,273 --> 02:05:42,340
you ain't whippin' shit.

1408
02:05:43,977 --> 02:05:46,799
Merci beaucoup mademoiselle, minnie.

1409
02:05:46,919 --> 02:05:51,255
- Oh that's real nice, what is that?
- It's French.

1410
02:05:51,375 --> 02:05:54,251
- You speak French?
- Oui-

1411
02:05:54,371 --> 02:05:58,229
- oui - what is that mean?
- It means yes.

1412
02:05:58,349 --> 02:06:01,275
Oui - yes.

1413
02:06:01,395 --> 02:06:05,781
- Hey Dave, ask me if my ass is fat.
- What?

1414
02:06:05,901 --> 02:06:09,155
- Ask me if my ass is fat?
- It is.

1415
02:06:09,507 --> 02:06:12,050
- I said ask me!
- Why?

1416
02:06:12,170 --> 02:06:15,916
- Just do it!
- Is your ass fat?

1417
02:06:16,036 --> 02:06:20,479
Oui, look at that y'all
I can speak French.

1418
02:06:57,695 --> 02:07:02,629
Are you the jelly bean
salesman around here?

1419
02:07:02,749 --> 02:07:05,253
How many peppermint
sticks I get for a nickel?

1420
02:07:05,265 --> 02:07:06,103
Five.

1421
02:07:06,223 --> 02:07:07,844
All right.

1422
02:07:12,094 --> 02:07:13,759
- Here.
- Thank you sugar.

1423
02:07:13,879 --> 02:07:15,718
Okay.

1424
02:07:23,146 --> 02:07:26,368
Allow me to assist you, madame.

1425
02:07:47,163 --> 02:07:49,377
I brought in your bags
in case anybody wants

1426
02:07:49,389 --> 02:07:51,368
to change your clothes
before red rock.

1427
02:08:01,161 --> 02:08:03,700
Peppermint stick?

1428
02:08:08,210 --> 02:08:09,871
Thanks.

1429
02:08:13,220 --> 02:08:17,726
So why do they call you
six horse Judy anyway?

1430
02:08:17,846 --> 02:08:21,427
Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever seen
that could drive a six horse team?

1431
02:08:21,547 --> 02:08:26,440
Hell yeah, kinda of a stupid question.

1432
02:08:29,445 --> 02:08:36,870
- Could you holding this for me?
- Rock steady, madame. Rock steady.

1433
02:08:38,847 --> 02:08:43,908
You gotta' very sweet accent,
where that from, England?

1434
02:08:44,028 --> 02:08:48,212
- I take exception to that!
- New zeeland.

1435
02:08:48,332 --> 02:08:53,700
- Carefull, madame.
- Is it anywhere near old Zealand?

1436
02:09:14,973 --> 02:09:17,977
Auckland, what the
fuck is an Auckland?

1437
02:09:17,989 --> 02:09:21,292
It's where I'm from,
it's our biggest city.

1438
02:09:24,413 --> 02:09:29,146
- Coffy's ready!
- It's about damn time.

1439
02:09:29,266 --> 02:09:33,121
- Best coffy on the mountain.
- I'll don't know 'bout all that.

1440
02:09:33,241 --> 02:09:37,636
Stagecoach drivers like it. Passengers,
not so much.

1441
02:09:37,756 --> 02:09:39,969
Most find it a
mite too strong.

1442
02:09:39,981 --> 02:09:43,319
Can't be too strong on
this mountain, thank you.

1443
02:09:48,304 --> 02:09:52,206
Well, what'd ya' think?

1444
02:10:17,884 --> 02:10:18,884
Shit!

1445
02:10:53,224 --> 02:10:57,761
He adds something,
not much, but something.

1446
02:10:58,139 --> 02:10:59,876
What do you think, Pete?

1447
02:11:03,703 --> 02:11:08,411
Well I must admit, he does make
the set up more convincing.

1448
02:11:14,609 --> 02:11:18,786
Do we collect the bodies
and Chuck 'em in the well out there?

1449
02:11:19,108 --> 02:11:22,257
And then start unhitching the horses
and get 'em in the barn and get 'em fed.

1450
02:11:22,377 --> 02:11:26,285
Well hang on, by puttin the
horses away that's easy enough.

1451
02:11:26,405 --> 02:11:29,860
To drag these fat bastards up and down the
mountain that's fucking impossible, mate.

1452
02:13:10,331 --> 02:13:13,511
Look I just started working here.

1453
02:13:13,631 --> 02:13:15,970
Whatever minnie to make y'all mad.

1454
02:13:16,937 --> 02:13:18,931
I had nothing to do with it.

1455
02:13:30,934 --> 02:13:34,659
Well old man,

1456
02:13:35,223 --> 02:13:42,071
if you was a cat what
just happened here

1457
02:13:42,191 --> 02:13:46,341
would count as one of your nine lives.

1458
02:13:46,844 --> 02:13:51,295
You realize how close you came to being
tossed on a pile of niggers?

1459
02:13:51,415 --> 02:13:56,793
Yes. And when it comes to that pile
of niggers we building out back,

1460
02:13:56,913 --> 02:14:01,022
won't take nothin' to make you
general of it. You believe that?

1461
02:14:01,142 --> 02:14:06,903
- I expect no less.
- Not so fast old man.

1462
02:14:07,023 --> 02:14:11,516
You might have a way out of this yet.

1463
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:15,483
Later today,

1464
02:14:15,603 --> 02:14:21,848
dirty son of a gun's gonna come in here.

1465
02:14:26,217 --> 02:14:29,097
And he's gonna have my sister with him,

1466
02:14:29,217 --> 02:14:33,427
and he's gonna have her in chains.

1467
02:14:35,964 --> 02:14:39,730
He's taking her into red rock to be hung.

1468
02:14:49,377 --> 02:14:52,317
- You know why?
- No.

1469
02:14:57,150 --> 02:15:00,353
Ten thousand dollars.

1470
02:15:01,219 --> 02:15:02,750
That's why.

1471
02:15:04,421 --> 02:15:06,073
And when he get's here.

1472
02:15:06,858 --> 02:15:10,906
I'm gonna' kill that fella'
and turn my sister lose.

1473
02:15:11,026 --> 02:15:14,962
Now do you have any reason
why you'd want to interfere

1474
02:15:14,974 --> 02:15:18,419
with me saving my sister
from a hangman's rope?

1475
02:15:18,539 --> 02:15:20,427
- No.
- You don't.

1476
02:15:20,547 --> 02:15:22,869
- No I don't.
- You sure you don't.

1477
02:15:22,989 --> 02:15:27,219
I mean we did just kill
minnie and sweet Dave.

1478
02:15:27,561 --> 02:15:30,441
You and sweet Dave
seemed pretty chummy over here.

1479
02:15:30,561 --> 02:15:35,778
I just met these people. I don't give a
damn about them, or you, or your sister,

1480
02:15:35,898 --> 02:15:40,108
or any other son of a bitch
in Wyoming for that matter.

1481
02:15:40,228 --> 02:15:44,519
That is a good answer, old man.

1482
02:15:45,586 --> 02:15:47,520
So when they get here,

1483
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:53,279
you just sit your ass in this chair.
And you don't do nothin'.

1484
02:15:53,399 --> 02:15:59,744
You don't say nothin'. Hello, thank
you, good night, that's about it.

1485
02:15:59,864 --> 02:16:04,054
Maybe your name, but that's it.

1486
02:16:04,174 --> 02:16:09,169
Hello, thank you, good night and...

1487
02:16:09,289 --> 02:16:11,747
- Maybe your name.
- Maybe my name.

1488
02:16:11,867 --> 02:16:17,648
Be an old man, be dotty.
Go to sleep.

1489
02:16:17,768 --> 02:16:21,209
And don't you say nothin'
and I mean nothin'

1490
02:16:21,221 --> 02:16:24,598
to that bounty hunter
that's got my sister.

1491
02:16:24,718 --> 02:16:27,991
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1492
02:16:30,155 --> 02:16:36,982
When it's safe I kill him,
free my sister and leave you be.

1493
02:16:39,401 --> 02:16:40,427
Deal?

1494
02:16:44,797 --> 02:16:48,281
Deal, thank you.

1495
02:16:49,893 --> 02:16:56,438
During the next four hours, Jody and the
boys Chuck the bodies down the well.

1496
02:16:57,123 --> 02:17:00,164
Put away the horses.

1497
02:17:01,393 --> 02:17:04,393
Tidied around minnie's.

1498
02:17:05,763 --> 02:17:08,945
Stash weapons for further use.

1499
02:17:12,308 --> 02:17:15,450
And waited for John Ruth
and Daisy's stage to arrive.

1500
02:17:15,570 --> 02:17:17,967
Here they come.

1501
02:17:18,087 --> 02:17:21,311
Okay boys, this is it, get ready!

1502
02:17:21,431 --> 02:17:23,466
Let's get ready.

1503
02:17:28,702 --> 02:17:33,173
Now remember, it dosen't matter
if we have four men or fory,

1504
02:17:33,293 --> 02:17:35,835
we're still gonna' be
facing John Ruth chained

1505
02:17:35,847 --> 02:17:38,510
to my sister with a pistol
pointed at her belly.

1506
02:17:38,630 --> 02:17:41,985
Now killin' that fella' 'fore he
kills my sister, ain't gonna' be easy.

1507
02:17:42,105 --> 02:17:45,277
But you believe that's
exactly what we're gonna do.

1508
02:17:45,397 --> 02:17:49,264
So the name of the game here is patience.

1509
02:17:49,384 --> 02:17:53,538
Trapped here for two or three days,
at some point, he will close his eyes

1510
02:17:53,658 --> 02:17:56,494
and that's when you
blow the top of his head off.

1511
02:17:56,614 --> 02:18:02,713
Remember old man, my sister don't make it
off this mountain alive, neither do you.

1512
02:18:02,833 --> 02:18:04,969
I'll do my best.

1513
02:18:21,508 --> 02:18:23,824
Good luck, mate.

1514
02:18:35,666 --> 02:18:40,298
What the hell's going on,
we weren't expecting another stage tonight?

1515
02:18:40,661 --> 02:18:43,702
I can see
you already got another one up in here.

1516
02:18:44,024 --> 02:18:47,146
I just got through putting the horses away.

1517
02:18:47,266 --> 02:18:50,910
This ain't the normal line. But we are
stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,

1518
02:18:51,030 --> 02:18:53,047
so it looks like you're stuck with us.

1519
02:18:53,167 --> 02:18:54,457
I can do another one.

1520
02:18:54,577 --> 02:18:56,752
And sweet Dave inside?

1521
02:18:56,872 --> 02:19:00,316
They ain't here.
I'm running the place while they're gone.

1522
02:19:01,948 --> 02:19:04,112
Where's minnie and sweet Dave?

1523
02:19:04,232 --> 02:19:08,635
He says they ain't here. He's lookin'
after the place while they gone.

1524
02:19:08,755 --> 02:19:13,529
- Who are you?
- I'm Bob.

1525
02:19:16,671 --> 02:19:19,712
Well whoever you are,
help o.B. With the horses.

1526
02:19:22,571 --> 02:19:27,808
Get 'em outta this cold,
before that blizzard hit's 'em.

1527
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:36,226
I just put those other horses away.
You need it done fast, you need to help.

1528
02:19:36,528 --> 02:19:39,811
I got two of my best men on it.

1529
02:19:40,718 --> 02:19:44,423
You heard him freeloaders,
get to work.

1530
02:19:47,573 --> 02:19:50,384
Come on let's go!

1531
02:19:50,504 --> 02:19:54,151
- Open up!
- You have to kick it open! - What?

1532
02:19:54,271 --> 02:19:57,071
Kick it open!

1533
02:20:01,321 --> 02:20:09,321
Last chapter
black man, white hell

1534
02:20:28,368 --> 02:20:29,778
how you doin' old boy?

1535
02:20:30,886 --> 02:20:34,451
They shot my nuts off they're freezin'

1536
02:20:34,571 --> 02:20:39,304
burining up the same time,
bleedin like a stuck pig.

1537
02:20:39,424 --> 02:20:42,084
I think I'm gonna die.

1538
02:20:42,204 --> 02:20:45,165
And these motherfuckers did it.

1539
02:20:46,273 --> 02:20:50,904
That's how I'm doin'.
How you doin'?

1540
02:20:51,024 --> 02:20:54,610
Well my leg hurts really bad.

1541
02:20:54,730 --> 02:20:57,852
But I think if I'm put all
my weight on my right foot-

1542
02:20:57,972 --> 02:21:01,296
I'm just bein' sarcastic
I don't give a fuck about your leg.

1543
02:21:02,605 --> 02:21:07,580
Just make yourself comfortable.

1544
02:21:07,700 --> 02:21:13,682
Don't worry about my comfort.
Shit! I can't feel my ass no more.

1545
02:21:13,802 --> 02:21:21,718
Worry about these owl hoots and that
bushwhacker nuts shooter in the basement.

1546
02:21:21,838 --> 02:21:23,953
All right!

1547
02:21:24,073 --> 02:21:26,229
You!

1548
02:21:26,349 --> 02:21:29,088
Fella' in the basement!

1549
02:21:29,208 --> 02:21:35,291
You either give up by the
time I count to three,

1550
02:21:35,411 --> 02:21:39,177
or I shoot domergue in the head.

1551
02:21:39,297 --> 02:21:42,432
One!... two!...

1552
02:21:42,439 --> 02:21:47,306
No, no, no, no! Don't shoot her!
I'm comin' up!

1553
02:21:47,426 --> 02:21:51,243
Hold on there you bushwhacker
sack shooter, you

1554
02:21:51,255 --> 02:21:54,685
just open the door we
tell you to come up!

1555
02:21:59,236 --> 02:22:02,055
Now throw out your pistol!

1556
02:22:02,175 --> 02:22:05,137
Throw it to the bed.

1557
02:22:06,748 --> 02:22:08,721
Well he got another.

1558
02:22:10,010 --> 02:22:12,870
Now throw out your other pistol.

1559
02:22:12,990 --> 02:22:14,278
I ain't got another pistol!

1560
02:22:14,398 --> 02:22:16,636
Well you better shit
another pistol out your ass!

1561
02:22:16,756 --> 02:22:21,370
Cause if you don't throw one up here in the
next two seconds we gonna' kill this bitch!

1562
02:22:25,377 --> 02:22:27,371
See? Told ya'.

1563
02:22:28,177 --> 02:22:29,929
Now...

1564
02:22:30,049 --> 02:22:32,748
With your hands where we can see 'em...

1565
02:22:32,868 --> 02:22:38,266
Slowly come on up!

1566
02:23:09,725 --> 02:23:12,041
How ya' doin' dummy?

1567
02:23:12,364 --> 02:23:15,385
Better now I see your ugly face.

1568
02:23:23,050 --> 02:23:26,340
How you like you that?
You bushwhacker castrator!

1569
02:23:26,460 --> 02:23:28,938
What are you doin' he was giving up?

1570
02:23:29,058 --> 02:23:31,415
It took him too long so I done for him.

1571
02:23:34,242 --> 02:23:38,645
Joe gage get your
ass over and shut this trap door.

1572
02:23:58,723 --> 02:24:00,556
I'm sorry, honey.

1573
02:24:08,995 --> 02:24:10,988
May I sit in the chair?

1574
02:24:11,108 --> 02:24:13,868
Yes you may.

1575
02:24:22,952 --> 02:24:25,812
Keep your hands flat on that table.

1576
02:24:25,932 --> 02:24:27,806
And don't move 'em.

1577
02:24:27,926 --> 02:24:29,861
Mannix!

1578
02:24:29,981 --> 02:24:33,284
You sure picked the wrong time to turn
into a nigger lover.

1579
02:24:33,404 --> 02:24:36,990
Don't you see that nigger and John Ruth
put you smack dab in the middle of danger?

1580
02:24:37,110 --> 02:24:39,210
You're about to be murdered
in some nigger named

1581
02:24:39,222 --> 02:24:41,119
minnie's house and you
don't even know why!

1582
02:24:41,925 --> 02:24:45,147
Okay, bitch...

1583
02:24:45,510 --> 02:24:49,092
I'll bite... why?

1584
02:24:49,104 --> 02:24:52,035
I am workin with all
three of them fella's...

1585
02:24:52,155 --> 02:24:54,855
But not cause they got
butterflies in their belly 'bout me.

1586
02:24:54,975 --> 02:25:00,333
But because we're all gang members,
the Jody domergue gang!

1587
02:25:00,453 --> 02:25:06,616
That fella' y'all just killed in the
basement, was Jody domergue, my brother!

1588
02:25:06,736 --> 02:25:11,389
Well who the hell,
is Jody domergue?

1589
02:25:11,509 --> 02:25:14,833
You wanna tell 'em bounty man?

1590
02:25:14,953 --> 02:25:18,840
He's a big bad cat.
He's worth fifty thousand dollars.

1591
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:22,888
And every member of his
gang is wort at least ten.

1592
02:25:23,008 --> 02:25:26,251
Wich finally explains why you're worth ten.

1593
02:25:26,371 --> 02:25:28,364
And what's gonna' happen
when that sun comes

1594
02:25:28,376 --> 02:25:30,292
out nigger, so is my
brother's fifteen men

1595
02:25:30,412 --> 02:25:32,998
comin' straight here for us!
Tell 'em grouch!

1596
02:25:33,118 --> 02:25:36,643
Jody's got fifteen men waitin' in red rock.

1597
02:25:36,763 --> 02:25:40,913
If we couldn't kill John
Ruth and free Daisy here.

1598
02:25:41,033 --> 02:25:48,243
Their job was to sack the town,
kill John Ruth and free Daisy there.

1599
02:25:48,363 --> 02:25:53,378
Now with brohter deadd,
I'm in charge of this gang, right boys?

1600
02:25:53,498 --> 02:25:55,108
Oh yeah.

1601
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:59,984
And Chris I'm tellin' you, you ain't
done anything yet, we can't forgive.

1602
02:26:00,488 --> 02:26:01,488
So...

1603
02:26:01,494 --> 02:26:04,055
- Let's make a deal?
- No deals, bitch!

1604
02:26:04,175 --> 02:26:07,318
You gonna' let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?

1605
02:26:07,330 --> 02:26:08,443
Hold it Warren.

1606
02:26:10,638 --> 02:26:14,539
Seein' as she ain't got
nothin' to sell, I'm

1607
02:26:14,551 --> 02:26:18,638
kinda curious about her
sales pitch, humor me.

1608
02:26:20,044 --> 02:26:23,877
All right, bitch.

1609
02:26:32,571 --> 02:26:37,686
What's... your... deal?

1610
02:26:37,806 --> 02:26:39,277
Easy.

1611
02:26:39,397 --> 02:26:43,527
Take your gun, shoot
that nigger dead.

1612
02:26:44,172 --> 02:26:48,038
Then we sit here all nice like
for the next two days.

1613
02:26:48,158 --> 02:26:49,589
When the snow melts...

1614
02:26:49,709 --> 02:26:57,001
We go back to Mexico and you go on to red
rock to get that star pinned on your chest.

1615
02:26:57,363 --> 02:27:02,337
Well... we can give 'em Marco.

1616
02:27:02,457 --> 02:27:06,124
Bob's real name is
"Marco the Mexican".

1617
02:27:06,244 --> 02:27:08,922
He's worth twelve thousand dollars.

1618
02:27:09,042 --> 02:27:12,992
- That's "Marco the Mexican"?
- Precisely, yeah.

1619
02:27:13,112 --> 02:27:19,195
Sheeit, after I blew his face off,
Marco ain't worth a peso.

1620
02:27:23,826 --> 02:27:29,848
If I die in the next two days, which
is more than likely, you can have me.

1621
02:27:29,968 --> 02:27:33,394
Under the name "English Pete
hicox" I've gotta' federal

1622
02:27:33,406 --> 02:27:36,292
bounty of fifteen thousand
dollars on my head.

1623
02:27:39,252 --> 02:27:43,763
- And it's all your Chris.
- You keep talkin', Pete.

1624
02:27:43,883 --> 02:27:47,368
You gonna talk yourself to death.

1625
02:27:47,488 --> 02:27:50,932
Joe gage, who you be?

1626
02:27:51,052 --> 02:27:55,142
- Grouch douglass.
- You heard of him?

1627
02:27:55,262 --> 02:28:01,668
Yeah, I heard of grouch douglass.
He's worth ten, just like Daisy.

1628
02:28:01,788 --> 02:28:04,226
Remind me,

1629
02:28:04,346 --> 02:28:09,059
why we wouldn't just kill
all y'all and cash in?

1630
02:28:09,179 --> 02:28:13,319
Oh, you can kill us all. But you'll
never spend a cent of that bounty money

1631
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:15,907
and you'll never leave this mountain alive.

1632
02:28:16,027 --> 02:28:17,998
Because when that snow
melts, the rest of Jody's

1633
02:28:18,010 --> 02:28:19,912
gang - all fifteen of 'em
that were waiting,

1634
02:28:20,032 --> 02:28:22,452
in red rock are comin' here.

1635
02:28:22,572 --> 02:28:25,513
Now let, let's say you shoot us all...

1636
02:28:25,633 --> 02:28:29,420
If you really want all that
domergue gang bounty money,

1637
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:32,522
you still got to get
all our corpses into red rock.

1638
02:28:32,642 --> 02:28:36,993
And that ain't gonna' be so easy. Cause I
doubt you can drive a four horse team.

1639
02:28:37,113 --> 02:28:39,905
And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two horse team.

1640
02:28:40,025 --> 02:28:44,747
So that means you're gonna' hafta'
lead a string of horses into red rock

1641
02:28:44,867 --> 02:28:47,416
and with that deep snow after a blizzard,

1642
02:28:47,536 --> 02:28:51,654
you ain't gonna' be able to get away with
any more then let's say one body per horse.

1643
02:28:51,774 --> 02:28:57,696
So that's you, leading a string of
four horses into red rock,

1644
02:28:57,816 --> 02:29:01,323
and with all them horses, in that snow,

1645
02:29:01,443 --> 02:29:04,303
and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.

1646
02:29:04,423 --> 02:29:06,740
And you gonna' run smack
dab into the domergue

1647
02:29:06,752 --> 02:29:08,734
gang and agin grouch,
how many is that?

1648
02:29:08,854 --> 02:29:13,064
- Fifteen killer strong.
- And when those fifteen killers,

1649
02:29:13,184 --> 02:29:15,279
come across you,

1650
02:29:15,399 --> 02:29:17,506
in possession of all of
our dead bodies, they

1651
02:29:17,518 --> 02:29:19,544
ain't just gonna' kill
you and that nigger.

1652
02:29:19,664 --> 02:29:25,317
There gonna go back to red rock
and kill every son of a bitch in that town.

1653
02:29:25,437 --> 02:29:29,212
You really the sheriff of red rock?
You wanna save the town?

1654
02:29:29,332 --> 02:29:31,623
Then shoot that nigger dead!

1655
02:29:36,184 --> 02:29:41,239
You belive in Jesus now, huh, bitch?
Well good 'cos 'bout meet him!

1656
02:29:41,359 --> 02:29:44,461
Anybody else wanna' make a deal, huh?

1657
02:29:44,581 --> 02:29:47,825
The deal still stands, Chris.

1658
02:29:47,945 --> 02:29:50,866
You ain't done we can't forgive.

1659
02:29:50,986 --> 02:29:53,505
It's still all on that nigger.

1660
02:29:54,601 --> 02:29:58,056
Shoot 'em dead, take my body

1661
02:29:58,176 --> 02:30:02,244
and sit out the snow with Daisy and grou-

1662
02:30:45,906 --> 02:30:47,859
mannix!

1663
02:30:48,504 --> 02:30:51,223
Give me my pistol!

1664
02:30:52,793 --> 02:30:56,036
Catch 'em here.

1665
02:31:00,126 --> 02:31:02,562
Catch 'em here.

1666
02:31:14,807 --> 02:31:16,116
So...

1667
02:31:16,821 --> 02:31:21,251
You were sayin'...
We sit here...

1668
02:31:21,371 --> 02:31:23,890
All nice and friendly like...

1669
02:31:24,010 --> 02:31:25,783
For the next two days...

1670
02:31:25,903 --> 02:31:27,394
Then the snow melts,

1671
02:31:27,514 --> 02:31:35,148
you leave here, meet up
with your gang and high tail it to Mexico?

1672
02:31:35,268 --> 02:31:36,860
Yeah.

1673
02:31:36,980 --> 02:31:42,016
And I get oswaldo and Joe gage?

1674
02:31:42,741 --> 02:31:44,412
Yeah.

1675
02:31:44,532 --> 02:31:47,272
But Jody's worth fifty thousand,
what 'bout his body?

1676
02:31:47,392 --> 02:31:55,392
You gonna make a deal with
this diabolical bitch?

1677
02:31:57,502 --> 02:32:03,102
I'm not sayin' I'm gonna' make a deal
with her, we're just talkin'. Calm down.

1678
02:32:04,090 --> 02:32:07,131
So what about Jody's body
and the fifty thousand?

1679
02:32:07,251 --> 02:32:09,366
You've gotten greedy, reb, no deal.

1680
02:32:09,486 --> 02:32:13,737
We take Jody's body back with us
he got children.

1681
02:32:15,751 --> 02:32:22,397
So I kill, Warren...
And we're all friends?

1682
02:32:22,517 --> 02:32:25,660
Yeah.

1683
02:32:35,227 --> 02:32:37,946
No deal, tramp.

1684
02:32:38,389 --> 02:32:42,470
Chris you're makin' the biggest
mistake of your life!

1685
02:32:42,590 --> 02:32:46,264
When our boys get here in a coupla' days,
their gonna cut your nuts off!

1686
02:32:46,384 --> 02:32:50,493
And there won't be a
stick left in that town unburnt.

1687
02:32:50,613 --> 02:32:54,437
Well I guess I should be
plum scared right now, huh?

1688
02:32:55,546 --> 02:32:58,629
If you had any brains, you would be.

1689
02:32:58,952 --> 02:33:00,583
You see...

1690
02:33:04,108 --> 02:33:06,283
Here's the problem Daisy.

1691
02:33:06,403 --> 02:33:10,251
In order for me to be
scared of your threats,

1692
02:33:10,371 --> 02:33:14,587
I got to believe in those fifteen extra
gang members waitin' it out in red rock.

1693
02:33:14,707 --> 02:33:19,717
And boy, oh boy... I sure don't.

1694
02:33:21,872 --> 02:33:24,450
What I belive is...

1695
02:33:24,570 --> 02:33:30,290
Joe gage or grouch douglass
whatever the fuck his name was...

1696
02:33:30,410 --> 02:33:33,874
Poisoned the coffy...

1697
02:33:33,994 --> 02:33:38,104
And you watched him do it.

1698
02:33:38,224 --> 02:33:44,307
And you watched me pork up
and didn't say shit...

1699
02:33:44,427 --> 02:33:47,725
And I believe...

1700
02:33:47,845 --> 02:33:50,934
You all what you've always been...

1701
02:33:51,054 --> 02:33:55,324
A lyin' bitch,
who will do anything...

1702
02:33:55,444 --> 02:33:58,324
To cheat that rope waitin'
for her in red rock.

1703
02:33:58,336 --> 02:34:01,408
Including shittin' out
fifteen extra gang members,

1704
02:34:01,528 --> 02:34:05,450
whenever you needs be.

1705
02:34:06,884 --> 02:34:07,911
And...

1706
02:34:12,020 --> 02:34:20,020
I believe when it comes to what's left of
the Jody Doe-ming-grey gang...

1707
02:34:20,156 --> 02:34:23,874
I'm lookin' at 'em,
right here right, right

1708
02:34:23,886 --> 02:34:27,870
now. Dead on this on this
motherfuckin' floor.

1709
02:34:27,990 --> 02:34:29,470
Goddamn right.

1710
02:34:29,482 --> 02:34:33,771
You're gonna' die on
this mountain, Chris.

1711
02:34:33,891 --> 02:34:38,945
- My brother leds an army of men-
- horse shit!

1712
02:34:40,174 --> 02:34:46,825
My daddy led an army, he led a
renegade amry, fightin' a lost cause!

1713
02:34:46,945 --> 02:34:50,511
My daddy held up to
four hundred men together after the war

1714
02:34:50,631 --> 02:34:54,977
with nothing but
their respect in his command.

1715
02:34:55,097 --> 02:35:00,395
Your brother's just a owl hoot
who led a gang of killers.

1716
02:35:01,442 --> 02:35:03,194
I don't feel so good.

1717
02:35:04,705 --> 02:35:06,239
Oh, shit.

1718
02:35:17,533 --> 02:35:20,372
You still alive, white boy?

1719
02:35:27,844 --> 02:35:29,032
Mannix?

1720
02:35:29,798 --> 02:35:30,798
Fuck!

1721
02:35:30,857 --> 02:35:31,914
Hey, boy!

1722
02:35:39,646 --> 02:35:40,995
Get up!

1723
02:35:46,775 --> 02:35:50,139
Chris mannix!
Your ass ain't nailed to the floor!

1724
02:35:50,259 --> 02:35:51,770
Wake the fuck up!

1725
02:35:59,363 --> 02:36:01,800
Wake up, white boy!

1726
02:36:23,453 --> 02:36:25,926
I ain't dead yet, you black bastard.

1727
02:36:37,547 --> 02:36:42,159
Chris mannix,
I may have misjudged you.

1728
02:36:43,661 --> 02:36:47,154
Now we've come to the part of the story...

1729
02:36:48,242 --> 02:36:53,659
- Where I blow your goddamn head off!
- No, no, no don't shoot her!

1730
02:36:53,779 --> 02:36:56,197
Why the hell not?

1731
02:36:57,385 --> 02:37:00,406
John Ruth.

1732
02:37:04,957 --> 02:37:09,126
John Ruth was one mighty, mighty bastard.

1733
02:37:15,129 --> 02:37:17,747
What's the Las thing...

1734
02:37:17,867 --> 02:37:21,130
That bastard did, 'fore he died?

1735
02:37:21,250 --> 02:37:23,346
Was save your life.

1736
02:37:23,466 --> 02:37:26,185
We gonna' die, white boy.

1737
02:37:26,305 --> 02:37:29,670
We ain't got no say in that.

1738
02:37:30,818 --> 02:37:34,383
But there's one thing left
we do have a say in.

1739
02:37:35,450 --> 02:37:38,934
And that how we kill this bitich.

1740
02:37:39,941 --> 02:37:43,264
And I say, shootin's to good for her...

1741
02:37:43,384 --> 02:37:48,863
John Ruth coulda shot her anywhere,
anytime along the way,

1742
02:37:48,983 --> 02:37:53,676
but John Ruth was the hangman...

1743
02:37:54,321 --> 02:37:58,833
And when the hangman catches ya',
you don't die by no bullet.

1744
02:37:59,477 --> 02:38:01,592
When the the hangman catches ya'...

1745
02:38:02,478 --> 02:38:04,210
You hang.

1746
02:38:05,177 --> 02:38:08,520
"You only need to hang mean bastards."

1747
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:13,274
"But mean bastards, you need to hang".

1748
02:38:36,215 --> 02:38:42,519
As my first and final act
as the sheriff of red rock,

1749
02:38:42,639 --> 02:38:45,117
I sentence you, domergue,

1750
02:38:45,237 --> 02:38:49,930
to hang by the neck until dead.

1751
02:39:04,471 --> 02:39:07,733
Hang on, Daisy.
I wanna watch.

1752
02:39:42,071 --> 02:39:45,052
Now that, was a nice dance.

1753
02:39:46,844 --> 02:39:49,845
That sure was pretty.

1754
02:40:42,432 --> 02:40:44,486
Hey...

1755
02:40:46,037 --> 02:40:48,877
Can I see that Lincoln letter?

1756
02:41:31,133 --> 02:41:34,395
Dear marquis...

1757
02:41:34,515 --> 02:41:38,041
I hope this letter finds you...

1758
02:41:38,161 --> 02:41:42,230
In good health and stat...

1759
02:41:42,350 --> 02:41:44,908
I'm doing fine...

1760
02:41:45,028 --> 02:41:49,923
Altough I whish
there were more hours in the day...

1761
02:41:50,043 --> 02:41:53,548
Is just so much to do...

1762
02:41:53,668 --> 02:41:58,382
Time's changing slowly...
But surely...

1763
02:41:58,502 --> 02:42:03,195
And it's men like you
that will make a difference...

1764
02:42:03,315 --> 02:42:07,444
Your military success was a credit...

1765
02:42:07,564 --> 02:42:12,761
Not only to you... but
your race aswell...

1766
02:42:12,881 --> 02:42:18,300
I'm very proud
everytime I hear new of you...

1767
02:42:18,420 --> 02:42:25,610
We still have a long way to go,
but hand in hand...

1768
02:42:25,730 --> 02:42:29,235
I know we'll get there...

1769
02:42:29,355 --> 02:42:34,693
I just want to let you know,
you're in my thoughts...

1770
02:42:34,813 --> 02:42:40,231
Hopefully our paths will
cross in the future...

1771
02:42:40,351 --> 02:42:47,199
Until then... i
remain your friend...

1772
02:42:47,319 --> 02:42:50,522
Ole' Mary Todd's calling...

1773
02:42:50,642 --> 02:42:56,060
So I guess it must be time for bed...

1774
02:42:56,180 --> 02:43:02,726
Respectfully... Abraham Lincoln.

1775
02:43:05,203 --> 02:43:09,976
Ole' Mary Todd...
That's a nice touch.

1776
02:43:10,096 --> 02:43:14,608
Yeah... thanks.

1777
02:43:24,798 --> 02:43:28,020
Creator: Deluce
happy x-mas, y'all.
