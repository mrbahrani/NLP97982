1
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,240
I wrote it all down:
4,200 square feet, four floors. Perfect.

2
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,040
Courtyard in back,
south-facing garden. Perfect.

3
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,620
- Shouldn't we wait for the car service?
- No, we'll sit in traffic forever.

4
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,210
- Is that the listing sheet?
- There is no listing sheet.

5
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,000
I heard about it this morning.
It'll be gone by this afternoon

6
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,250
- Well, how many more after this one?
- None. You know how tight the market is.

7
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,260
- Sarah, do you have to ride that here?
- Mom, we're in the street.

8
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,140
Evan!

9
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,480
One day you will learn
to respect people's time, Lydia.

10
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,110
You'll realize that the world does not stop
and start at your convenience.

11
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,480
I’m so sorry.

12
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,440
I’m meeting Arthur Digby Laurence
in 26 minutes...

13
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,160
...and if you think he's the kind of man
who tolerates tardiness...

14
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,160
...you are sadly mistaken.

15
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,700
You're a saint to wait for us.

16
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,660
- Thank you.
- Hello.

17
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,840
It’s kind of between a townhouse
and a brownstone.

18
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,380
We call it a "townstone."

19
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,220
Built in 1879, this is the middle
of the house, the parlor floor.

20
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,510
Here is the living room.
Formal dining is in the back.

21
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,310
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...

22
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,440
...which was renovated in '94
with all the expected amenities.

23
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,940
Sarah.

24
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,900
There are two bedroom floors above.

25
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,860
My God, it's amazing.

26
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,240
Hey, kid. No scooter.

27
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,870
I don't have to tell you this amount
of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.

28
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,290
It’s got a yard. Sort of.

29
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,920
It is in a bit of disarray, but then again,
21-foot lot, 53 deep.

30
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,970
It allows for an expansive garden.

31
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,140
Working elevator.

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,470
The previous owner was disabled
the last years of his life.

33
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,140
Highly unusual, the elevator.

34
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,640
You will not find this
in 90 percent of brownstones.

35
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,980
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper,
but we anticipate enormous interest.

36
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,320
It’s a very emotional property.

37
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,910
Shall we have a look at the rest?

38
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,950
You should make an offer immediately.

39
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,450
Can I see it first?

40
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,080
There is nothing like this
on the market right now.

41
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,670
You can't move from Greenwich
to the Upper West Side...

42
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,670
...and expect to still have a house, a yard
and a dog and cat, but here it is.

43
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,430
It’s got everything
you told me you wanted and more.

44
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,720
You'll have another family.
You could have two.

45
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,100
It’s a fortune.

46
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,430
Mom, it's not Barneys.
You don't have to pay the price on the tag.

47
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,610
He can afford it.

48
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,780
It would be so lovely if I could
show the property before I leave.

49
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,460
Hardwood floors throughout,
as many as six working fireplaces.

50
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,000
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms.
One at either end.

51
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,040
They share one small bath.

52
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,920
Originally, this would have been
the servants' quarters.

53
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,630
The previous owner
kept a small nursing staff.

54
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,090
I don't know if you have live-in help.

55
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,970
No, it's just the two of us.

56
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,770
Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
or what have you.

57
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,360
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.

58
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,530
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine,
the financier.

59
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,360
May I ask what you do, Mrs....

60
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,240
Altman.

61
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,870
Actually, I’m going back to school.
Columbia.

62
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,040
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.

63
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,880
I didn't realize
you were Stephan Altman's wife.

64
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,750
Yes, until recently.

65
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,210
Master bath.

66
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,760
Pearlstine's been in all the papers
since he died.

67
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,430
His kids are suing each other
over the estate.

68
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,560
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.

69
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,810
Now they can't find half his money.

70
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,810
I hardly see how gossip
is germane to showing the property.

71
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,190
Stop calling it "the property."
It sounds ridiculous.

72
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,570
Walk-in closet.

73
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,780
Could the little one please stop that?

74
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,490
Kid, no elevator!

75
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,370
And we emerge in the master suite.

76
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,090
That's strange.

77
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,340
What?

78
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,930
Is this room smaller than it should be?

79
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,100
You're the first person to notice.

80
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,900
On caravan, no one from our office
had the slightest idea.

81
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,750
It’s called a panic room.

82
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,580
- What?
- A safe room.

83
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,790
- A castle keep in medieval times.
- I've read about these.

84
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,130
They're in vogue in high-end construction.

85
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,880
One can't be too careful
about home invasion.

86
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,340
This is perfect.

87
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,680
The alarm goes off
in the middle of the night.

88
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,760
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?

89
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,520
Traipse downstairs in your underthings
to check it out? I think not.

90
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,690
Concrete walls. Buried phone line,
not connected to the house's main line.

91
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,530
Call the police, nobody can cut you off.
You have your own ventilation system.

92
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,820
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers
nearly every corner of the house.

93
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,120
This whole thing makes me nervous.

94
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,530
Why?

95
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,450
Ever read any Poe?

96
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,790
No, but I loved her last album.

97
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,290
What's to keep somebody
from prying open the door?

98
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,540
Steel.

99
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,250
Thick steel. Very thick steel.

100
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,920
Full battery backup,
so even if the power's out...

101
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,630
...it's still functional.

102
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,640
Oh, my god.
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?

103
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,850
Open it, please.

104
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,520
And with kids like he's apparently got,
no wonder he wanted a place to hide.

105
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,810
Please open the door.

106
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,480
That is highly inappropriate.

107
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,520
Open the door, please.

108
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,450
My room. Definitely my room.

109
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,160
This is really dangerous.

110
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,660
- That door is a hazard.
- Not at all.

111
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,170
Motion detector, like an elevator.

112
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,880
The door won't close if it's blocked.
There's another one at your ankles.

113
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,130
It couldn't be safer.

114
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,770
I know they'll take asking price.

115
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,340
It’s working. I hooked up the phone!

116
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,380
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.

117
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,220
579 what?

118
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,380
3000.

119
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,890
Patsy's Pizza. please hold.

120
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,320
Hey. Enough.

121
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,080
Mind the pizza?

122
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,580
What do you mean?

123
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,040
Our first night.
I should've thought of something special.

124
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,620
I like pizza.

125
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,890
Fuck him.

126
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,440
Don't.

127
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,730
Fuck her, too.

128
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,690
I agree.

129
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,490
But don't.

130
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,430
Don't you think this place
has way too many stairs?

131
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,350
You didn't carry anything up them.

132
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,930
You never asked
what I thought of this house.

133
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,140
I didn't want you to tell me you hated it.

134
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,560
- I liked our old house.
- Well, so did I.

135
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,020
You know what I was thinking?

136
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,780
I was thinking we could
stencil the whole bookcase.

137
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,740
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.

138
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,740
Go ahead.

139
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,250
Oh, damn.

140
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,540
I forgot to set up that tour
of your new school.

141
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,000
Dad already did it.
I’m going with him on Sunday.

142
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,590
Oh, yeah?

143
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,050
So I’ll take a cab and meet him there.

144
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,220
Is that what he said?

145
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,140
Isn't that what's so great
about Manhattan?

146
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,350
You don't have to drive me everywhere?

147
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,850
I’ll ride with you.

148
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,190
Why'd you bring me here
if I can't go anywhere on my own?

149
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,860
That's it. I quit.

150
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,780
I’m not fighting with you till tomorrow.

151
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
Come here.

152
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,490
It’s disgusting how much I love you.

153
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,240
Tell me about it.

154
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,750
- Mom?
- Yeah.

155
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,260
It’s too dark.

156
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,560
Better?

157
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,520
That's better.

158
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,430
"Bypass non-ready zone."

159
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,230
"Bypass non-ready zone."

160
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,060
"Shunt. Enter."

161
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,120
"Bypass non-ready zone."

162
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,780
"Shunt."

163
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,910
"Enter zone number."

164
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,420
"Shunt again."

165
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,590
ln the morning I got to figure out
how to turn this thing off.

166
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,210
Go, go back.

167
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,510
Do it.

168
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,190
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.

169
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,940
Amateur.

170
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,110
We got a problem! We need to talk!

171
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,820
It’s about time. I’m freezing
my tits off out there.

172
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,700
- Who is that?
- This is Raoul.

173
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,250
Who the fuck is Raoul?

174
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,210
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.

175
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,670
- Where'd you get him?
- Through some people.

176
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,420
Open the fucking door.

177
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,010
No shit.

178
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,100
What is this?

179
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,560
There's a girl on the top floor,
a woman on the third. They're asleep.

180
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,060
They're not supposed to be here.

181
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,400
- This is your department, Junior!
- They are not supposed to be here!

182
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,440
Videotape. We're on videotape.

183
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,530
We've been on videotape since we got here
and the tapes are upstairs.

184
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,160
- 14-day escrow.
- You fucked me!

185
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,290
14-day escrow! That's almost 3 weeks!
They should not be in for another week!

186
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,000
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?

187
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,840
Business days.
Escrow is always business days.

188
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,670
Five-day weeks always!

189
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,390
Right?

190
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,800
I’m out of here.

191
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,810
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!

192
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,140
We can handle this.
Can we still handle this?

193
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,480
It’s just a woman and a kid?

194
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,820
- Unless Daddy comes home.
- He's not.

195
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,820
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some
B model on the Upper East Side.

196
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,700
It’s just her and the kid!

197
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,740
Now, can we do this?

198
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,950
Yeah, we can do it.

199
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,040
Not with people here. And not with me.

200
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,500
- Wait! Twenty minutes!
- She'll call the police.

201
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,550
They'll be here before I unpack my bags.

202
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,680
So, we keep an eye on her.

203
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,390
Raoul can totally administrate that part.

204
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,520
I don't want Raoul to administrate that!
He's not even supposed to be here!

205
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,360
Nobody gets hurt.

206
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,190
What about us? What if she has a gun?

207
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,530
Who are you?

208
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,200
I’m Raoul.

209
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,720
You know we can't do this without you!

210
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,590
This is still a good plan.

211
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,930
Fuck that! This is a great plan.
It’s just got a slight twist.

212
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,350
Yeah.

213
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,560
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.

214
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,480
You make a lot of promises, don't you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.

215
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,570
No family.

216
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,400
You're right. It’s all fucked up.
I fucked it up!

217
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,570
It’s not how it's supposed to be.

218
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:25,120
But the fact of the matter is
there's still $3,000,000 in this house...

219
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,380
...and no one but you and l
even knows it's here.

220
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,550
Hey, I want that money. I want it!

221
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,300
But you...

222
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,720
...you need that money.

223
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,770
Or have you forgotten why you're here?

224
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,940
So let's quit dicking around, okay,
and get this over with.

225
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,110
Kill the phones.

226
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,490
Top floor, little girl. l've
got the mother. Give me that!

227
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,240
You stay here! Nobody gets past!

228
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,460
Wake up! Sarah!

229
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,210
Get up!

230
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,010
What did you do that for?

231
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,360
Where are you going?

232
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,950
- What's going on?
- People. ln the house.

233
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,870
They're in the elevator, heading down.

234
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,230
Fuck! They're coming down to you!

235
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,810
I told you. I don't hurt people.

236
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,190
They're going downstairs.

237
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,860
- That room.
- What?

238
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,450
The panic room.

239
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,120
No, press emergency stop.

240
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,790
Fuck!

241
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,790
Coming back up!

242
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,470
That's you.

243
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,810
Shit.

244
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,280
Go!

245
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,570
Fuck!

246
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,240
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

247
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,250
Damn it! Mother...

248
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,210
Shit!

249
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,510
That's seven years bad luck.

250
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,810
Shit.

251
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,450
Tell me they're not in there.

252
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,600
Oh, damn.

253
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,270
- It doesn't work?
- It’s a different phone line.

254
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,230
I never hooked it up.

255
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,400
Now what?

256
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,850
I can't hear a thing.

257
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,560
What do you think they want?

258
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,520
I don't know. Rob us....

259
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,810
I don't know.

260
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,480
What do we do?

261
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,650
We wait.

262
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,610
- What if they get in here?
- Well, they can't.

263
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,490
They can't get in. It’s not possible.

264
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,200
Mom. I heard you.

265
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,330
- Do you feel okay?
- Yeah.

266
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,870
- You shaky?
- No.

267
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,420
- Chills?
- No.

268
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,220
Please. Don't worry about me.

269
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,150
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?

270
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,070
Hang out while the cops waltz in?
Use your head.

271
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,490
Here he comes.

272
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,580
I locked the roof access.
She's not getting down from there.

273
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,620
- Good.
- She could be in there calling the cops.

274
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,910
Could she have hooked it up today?

275
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,130
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.

276
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,340
She would've had to do it through
Manhattan Security, my company.

277
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,090
I checked the paperwork
and the phone is not connected.

278
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,220
You see? She couldn't have.

279
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,260
- I thought she wouldn't be here.
- He said she wouldn't.

280
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,270
Fuck you! And fuck you!
She is not supposed...

281
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,980
Do it.

282
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,610
Excuse me.

283
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,950
The police are on their way.

284
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,670
- She's lying.
- You're full of...

285
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,880
It’s not an intercom. It’s a PA system.

286
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,680
I know. I’m just scaring her.

287
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,220
I suggest you leave before they get here.

288
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,900
- What?
- He's saying that we don't have a phone.

289
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,440
How could he know that?

290
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,150
Take what you want and get out!

291
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,200
If only it were that easy.

292
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,530
Some paper. I need some paper.
Give me some paper.

293
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?

294
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,290
You got a piece of paper?

295
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,170
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

296
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,730
"What we want is in that room"?

297
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,980
They're coming in here, aren't they?

298
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,610
No, no. I told you. They can't get in here.

299
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,030
What do you know about this room?

300
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,860
What do we know about that room?

301
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,360
- Let’s not tell her anything.
- Just a few details.

302
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,800
We're not coming out,
and we're not letting you in!

303
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,840
Get out of my house!

304
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,220
- Say "fuck."
- You fuck.

305
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,180
- Mom.
- What?

306
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,230
"Get the fuck out of my house."

307
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,480
Get the fuck out of my house!

308
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,490
Okay, I have an idea.

309
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,410
She's a woman. Women need security.

310
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,450
She won't believe you.

311
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,500
She needs to know she's dealing
with decent people and she can trust us.

312
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,260
Conversation's over!

313
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,850
What? She's not coming down?

314
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,440
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?

315
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,690
Like that'll help you think.

316
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,150
You know what? Fine! You think!

317
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,400
- What if she did call the cops?
- She didn't.

318
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,610
She said it again, that
she called the cops.

319
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,200
If cops were coming,
do you think l'd still be here?

320
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,080
Okay, fine. Good, excellent.
We all believe you.

321
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,450
How do we get into that room?

322
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,840
What is funny about this?

323
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,590
Is this shit funny to you?

324
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:24,010
I spent the last 12 years
building these rooms...

325
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,340
...to keep out people like us.

326
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:31,310
It’s all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?

327
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,140
We can't.

328
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,900
You can't get in the panic room.

329
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,650
That's the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.

330
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,940
And why would she do that?

331
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,110
I don't know.

332
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:49,330
But when she does,
she can't get out of this house.

333
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,710
We keep her here,
we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...

334
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,960
...and I don't want any help
from Joe Pesci over here.

335
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,340
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.

336
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,920
We make it impossible for them to leave.

337
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,510
And why would they come out
in the first place?

338
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,560
I’m working on that.

339
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,940
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

340
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,450
Small space?

341
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,450
I’m okay.

342
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,490
- You can't wig out.
- I know.

343
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,330
- I mean it.
- I won't.

344
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,290
You know,
people never get buried alive anymore.

345
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,380
I guess it used to happen all the time.

346
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,670
Really?

347
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,340
Yeah, I read that.

348
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,890
And when did this happen all the time?

349
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,480
Twenty, thirty years ago.

350
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,440
What are they doing now?

351
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,490
I don't know.

352
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,800
They're locking us in.

353
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,930
This is not happening.

354
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,980
Sarah, calm down.

355
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,490
You know what could happen
if you let yourself get worked up.

356
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,950
Sarah!

357
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,940
- What the hell are you doing?
- We're coming in from below.

358
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,570
No, you're not. Even if you got through
the concrete, there's steel.

359
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,400
You won't even make a dent.

360
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,570
We'll see.

361
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,070
Hey. This is what I do.

362
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,200
If some idiot with a sledgehammer
could break in...

363
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,410
...do you really think
that I would still have a job?

364
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,170
Don't get that in your eye.

365
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,790
Neighbor.

366
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,250
Help!

367
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,670
Please help us!

368
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,260
- Call the police!
- Do you hear us?

369
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,760
Help us!

370
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,650
Help!

371
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,820
- Help us, please!
- Call the police!

372
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,110
Shit!

373
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,390
You guys just going to stand there?

374
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,190
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?

375
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,640
He can't get in here with a hammer,
can he?

376
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,320
Could you be any louder?

377
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,660
Give me a hand with those boxes.

378
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,330
Listen, goddamn it!

379
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,000
I’m in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?

380
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,300
- They're going to get in here.
- No, they can't get in here.

381
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,680
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.

382
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,380
Oh, this is good.

383
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,550
This could work.

384
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,010
I was just thinking
that we should do something like this.

385
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,060
- Open it.
- I just did.

386
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,020
Open it some more.

387
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:20,020
We're just sending them a message.

388
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,770
They'll get the point.

389
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,440
Honey, get down on the ground.

390
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:14,450
Quit dicking around
and open this fucking thing up.

391
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,660
- Don't be stupid.
- Quiet!

392
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,370
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.

393
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,880
What is it?

394
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,630
It’s bad.

395
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,260
They're coughing.

396
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,890
If they're coughing, they're going to die!

397
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,640
Nobody is going to die, man!

398
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,060
Will you please have the balls
to follow through with something?

399
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,540
Mom.

400
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,500
The worst that'll happen is they'll
pass out. They'll have a hangover.

401
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,800
How are we going to get in there
if they pass out, Junior?

402
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,680
Cut it back a little.

403
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,760
They won't pass out, numb-nuts.
They'll throw up first.

404
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,930
We can't get in if they're dead!

405
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,480
Stay on the ground and breathe.

406
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,780
Turn it down.

407
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:32,990
Turn it down! It’s too much!

408
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,660
- Don't you start up with this shit.
- Keep it down!

409
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:48,040
I’m turning it down.

410
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,630
- Keep his ass off of me.
- We're not killing anybody.

411
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,230
- Tell him to turn it down!
- Turn the shit off.

412
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,560
- No.
- Turn it down.

413
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,280
- Mom?
- Just a second.

414
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,040
Get under this.

415
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:28,880
Oh, my god.

416
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,800
- Fucking amateurs, man!
- It’s my fucking idea.

417
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,310
Shut the fuck up! There are people
trying to sleep over there.

418
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,210
What is that?

419
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,210
Turn the gas off.

420
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:25,270
Turn the gas off right now.

421
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,250
Get back!

422
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,040
Shit!

423
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,300
God!

424
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,720
Get it off me!

425
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,350
It’s okay.

426
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,690
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
I’m coming in there!

427
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,860
Calm the fuck down.

428
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,000
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

429
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:34,040
Promise me you'll never do
anything like that.

430
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,250
I won't.

431
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:42,640
They're moving.
At least they're still moving in there.

432
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,070
What?

433
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,070
Talk to him.

434
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:03,530
Please, man, give it a rest.

435
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,970
- That Morse code?
- SOS.

436
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,810
Where'd you learn that?

437
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,350
Titanic.

438
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,820
We got to talk. Downstairs.

439
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:32,330
No, no, no. Not you.

440
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,300
Come on, come on, come on.

441
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:44,880
Get up.

442
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:47,340
Come on.

443
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,850
Wake up.

444
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,200
The first thing I’m going to do this
morning is call my plastic surgeon.

445
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,290
There's been a change here.
$100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.

446
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:16,500
I want a third
of whatever's in that room up there.

447
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:21,710
Fine!

448
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:26,090
Okay? Full share, one-third.
Congratulations.

449
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,890
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000.
Your parents will be proud.

450
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,540
Got him.

451
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,000
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.

452
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:01,580
I’m not losing
my half of the money because...

453
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,170
Slow down. Half?

454
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:06,710
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third....

455
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:08,930
Come on.

456
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,270
I’m letting you know he's a problem.

457
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,270
But this wasn't my idea,
so he's your problem.

458
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,690
You're right. It wasn't your idea!

459
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:23,940
None of this was your idea!
It was my idea!

460
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,200
Come on, look over here.

461
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:42,830
Yes.

462
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,000
Yes, yes, yes.

463
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,970
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.

464
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,980
- We're here!
- Help us!

465
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,850
We're over here!

466
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,570
Help!

467
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,870
Open your window!

468
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:16,280
Help!

469
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,130
We're never going to get out of here.

470
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,850
I’m the loving grandson who put in
the time with the old man...

471
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:41,350
...every goddamn weekend for two years...

472
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,560
...talking to him, dressing him,
walking him, feeding him.

473
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,150
Are you done?

474
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:49,530
No. I’m the one the old man
finally told about the safe.

475
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:53,490
I’m the one who found the guy who built it,
and I convinced him to break into it!

476
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,450
Wait a minute.

477
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:04,830
- What?
- The bedroom's empty. Where are they?

478
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,800
Two of them, on the stairs.

479
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:11,130
Where's the third guy?

480
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,180
I left my cell phone by the bed.

481
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,180
I earned that money.

482
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,980
I will not let you jeopardize
my fucking plan...

483
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,400
...because you have a problem
relating to others!

484
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,240
Got it?

485
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,740
If I don't come back, close this door.

486
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,620
Just do what I say.

487
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:41,870
He touches me again, I’ll shoot him.

488
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,000
Christ!

489
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,670
Wait!

490
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:53,510
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle,
or can we get back to work?

491
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,930
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.

492
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:58,970
I’ll shove it up your ass and snap it off.

493
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,470
You're a bus driver, Raoul.

494
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:04,270
You live in Flatbush.

495
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:07,230
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard
bullshit you just heard...

496
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,270
...because I saw that movie, too.

497
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:10,730
What is this?

498
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,400
I got some news for you.

499
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,070
Go.

500
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,740
Go!

501
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,640
Fuck!

502
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,230
She got something. What did she get?

503
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,400
No.

504
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,650
Charger!

505
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,530
She has a cell phone.

506
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:25,070
No!

507
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:28,330
All right, signal.

508
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:31,250
Come on. Signal.

509
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:46,220
I don't think they'll be talking
on no cell phone from in there.

510
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:49,930
- Why not?
- You can't call out from in there.

511
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,400
No signal.

512
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,780
I didn't hook up this line,
but I hooked up the main line.

513
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:09,410
If we can find it, we can cut into it.

514
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:16,210
I can't go to prison, man.
I’m not built for that shit.

515
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:28,510
Be careful.

516
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,320
Get the phone.

517
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:43,610
- It doesn't come off.
- Rip it off!

518
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,330
Screwdriver. Phillips.

519
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:09,050
Junior, when I asked you to cut
the phone lines, did you cut the main line?

520
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:12,640
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone
in the kitchen?

521
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:39,670
Shit!

522
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:44,710
Strip this and expose the wires.

523
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,050
- What are we doing?
- I have no idea.

524
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,750
- Okay, got it?
- Yeah. Here.

525
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,080
Okay.

526
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,170
Yellow, yellow.

527
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,560
Okay.

528
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:40,100
Dial tone.

529
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,450
911 emergency.

530
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,370
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street...

531
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:56,660
- Please hold.
- No, no. God.

532
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:03,330
Call Dad.

533
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:12,180
How do you live in New York
and not have a single Percocet?

534
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:17,680
- Hello?
- Stephan. Put Stephan on the line.

535
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:19,640
- Who is this?
- It’s Meg.

536
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,150
Do you know what time it is?

537
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,820
- Put him on the phone, bitch.
- It's your fucking wife.

538
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:30,820
Move.

539
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:35,280
- Hello?
- You've got to help us.

540
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:36,370
Move!

541
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,830
There are three men upstairs.
They broke in...

542
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:44,250
What...

543
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:01,270
- He'll do something.
- No, he won't.

544
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:02,890
He'll call the police.

545
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,190
You don't know her. She won't let him.

546
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,820
No. He knows that there's trouble.
He heard me.

547
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:12,990
He's across the park. That's why
we got houses close to each other.

548
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:15,530
Just in case we needed each other.
He'll help us.

549
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,910
- He won't.
- Yes, he will!

550
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,210
I’m sorry.

551
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,630
No, I’m sorry.

552
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,840
Why?

553
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,170
I was trying not to tell you.

554
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:35,430
What?

555
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:38,010
I’m dizzy and hungry.

556
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:44,520
All she's got is Nyquil and fucking Midol.

557
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,440
Looks like that gas idea
didn't work so well.

558
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,570
Whose fault was that?

559
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,070
This is impossible.

560
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,950
What's the plan now, hot rod?

561
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:57,740
This is worse than impossible.
This is unpleasant.

562
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:02,620
Here, drink this.
All right, drink lots of water.

563
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:06,710
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood-sugar up.

564
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:08,290
Can you hear me okay?

565
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,170
I’m just dizzy, not deaf.

566
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:13,340
Great. Smart ass. That's excellent.

567
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:17,720
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?

568
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,510
Let's check it again.

569
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,010
Mom, I did it.

570
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:23,270
We got to stay calm, okay?

571
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:26,560
If we stay calm, everything will be fine.
All right? Stay calm.

572
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,190
You're making me nervous.

573
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,060
I’m sorry.

574
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,230
What if I keep dropping?

575
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:37,360
You won't. I’ll figure something out.

576
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,660
You know, he's right.

577
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:44,870
There's no way
we're getting into that room.

578
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,540
What are you talking about?

579
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,790
I just got to be honest with myself here.

580
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,210
I don't need to be involved...

581
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:57,130
...with anything so harrowing
or perilous at this point in my life.

582
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:00,090
- You're giving up?
- Hell, yes.

583
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:03,970
I don't need the fucking aggravation.
I’ll make an anonymous phone call.

584
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:08,230
They'll find the floor safe. I’ll inherit.

585
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:11,150
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.

586
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,780
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.

587
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:19,070
Fuck, I’ll still put away 8 or 9 hundred
grand and keep my goddamn hair.

588
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:22,990
Take it. Go out and get loaded.

589
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:25,660
Wait a minute.

590
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,830
Say what you just said again.

591
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,510
Say that shit about the money
again, babycakes.

592
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:42,100
When? Before?

593
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,720
Yeah, before.

594
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:47,520
Splitting the money in your head,
you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.

595
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,560
What are you doing?

596
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:54,650
That was after tax, which makes it more
than a million and a half gross.

597
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,400
So now you're a tax attorney.

598
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,330
- I'm out of here.
- Wait a minute.

599
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:09,040
There's sugar in everything.
Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.

600
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:10,710
Where else?

601
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:15,290
Travel kit.

602
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,170
Plus, you named eight people
you got to split it with...

603
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,800
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks
in the safe.

604
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:24,140
A fuck-up like you has got to get less
than everybody else...

605
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,220
...so now I don't know what to think.

606
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,180
You're adding up money
you'll never touch, buddy.

607
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:32,230
How much is in there?

608
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,860
Mouthwash.

609
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:37,770
Saccharin.

610
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,280
Hey, I’m talking to you. Answer me.

611
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:45,160
Fine. There's more.

612
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:49,000
And when were you going to tell us
this minor economic detail?

613
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,500
It doesn't matter now.
It’s totally fucking moot!

614
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:55,460
- Why are we having this conversation?
- What were you thinking?

615
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:58,000
How did you expect to get away with this?

616
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:00,210
Did you think that l'd open that safe...

617
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:03,630
...and then me and Raoul would wait
while you picked out your share?

618
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:06,430
What's the matter with you?

619
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:09,560
You got us into this mess,
and you were going to fuck us?

620
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,230
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.

621
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:16,110
Your eyes were huge
when I told you about the gig...

622
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,610
...so don't play innocent.

623
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:20,190
Things didn't work out.

624
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:23,240
Play past it.

625
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,450
Mints? Sugar-free.

626
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,200
Mints? Sugar-free.

627
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:34,830
I’m opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.

628
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,830
It’s looking doubtful there, big guy.

629
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,760
I will split the money with Raoul.
But I don't ever want to see you again.

630
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,590
Cops show up on my doorstep,
we will know who sent them...

631
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,930
...and we will fucking find you.

632
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:52,810
I’ll see you, Burnham.

633
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,310
Later, Raoul.

634
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:02,780
Mom!

635
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,830
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street
a couple of times...

636
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,130
...think you know all about it.

637
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,170
You don't know nothing about me.

638
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,220
Sarah, listen to me:

639
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:29,300
Go to the corner. Shut your eyes
and don't turn around.

640
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:30,470
Okay.

641
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:37,520
You should see the look on your face.

642
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,190
What's happening?

643
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:43,780
- Don't move. Don't you fucking move.
- No, don't.

644
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:45,240
Come here.

645
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:46,700
Come here.

646
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:49,700
- Don't shoot, please.
- Come on.

647
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:54,200
Shut it, lock it
and get the fuck away from it.

648
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,880
- Stop it, you fucking...
- Fucking what?

649
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:06,550
Clown? ldiot? Fucking asshole?

650
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:09,890
Who's the clown now?

651
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,180
Me.

652
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,560
That's right.

653
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,850
It’s burning me.

654
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,350
Who's got the gun?

655
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:18,190
You.

656
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:20,360
Remember that.

657
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,570
Find out who the fuck that is.

658
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:28,860
Give me your wallet.

659
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,620
Give me your wallet.

660
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:38,080
Stephan Altman.

661
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,550
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan?

662
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:51,720
What did she say?

663
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,770
Don't know. Cut off.

664
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:59,600
- Phones are dead.
- Did you call anybody else?

665
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,940
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?

666
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:09,610
No.

667
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:11,700
He's telling the truth.

668
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,240
Yeah.

669
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,870
Yeah, he probably is.

670
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,960
Because when I do this, people don't lie.

671
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:20,580
What?

672
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,920
- What do you want?
- Get us into that room.

673
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:25,460
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

674
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:29,470
You're full of ideas.
You just got to squeeze one out.

675
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:31,590
You want me to just make something up?

676
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:33,850
You've got till the count of three.

677
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:36,430
Then you end up like Junior over there.

678
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,690
- One, squeeze.
- This is ridiculous.

679
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:42,900
Two, squeeze.

680
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,610
I don't know what to tell you.

681
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:45,860
- Three.
- Wait!

682
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:47,690
Okay.

683
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:52,110
I got an idea.

684
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:57,910
Maybe.

685
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,500
Maybe.

686
01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:03,920
Help! Rubber Soul...

687
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:07,630
...Yesterday and Today,
Magical Mystery Tour, The White Album....

688
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:11,010
Stay warm, baby. Stay warm, all right?

689
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:16,430
Let It Be, Reviver, Sgt. pepper....

690
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:17,890
Oh, god!

691
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,140
Dad?

692
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:24,440
No, no.

693
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,330
Take it easy.

694
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:41,540
Open the door! Open the door!

695
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:47,420
No.

696
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,840
Don't open the door!

697
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,600
- Just make it look good.
- Don't you tell me what...

698
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:05,310
Open the door!

699
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:07,560
Don't open...

700
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,610
Knock it off!

701
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:18,830
You kill him, they'll never open that door.

702
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,920
Oh, god.

703
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:33,210
All right. Lie down. Lie down.

704
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:34,720
Lie down.

705
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,180
All right.

706
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,680
You'll be fine. Come on.

707
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:44,980
He's fucking crazy.

708
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,940
Get your hands off him,
you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!

709
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:50,190
You're a strong girl.

710
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:53,690
You be strong. Be strong, sweetheart.

711
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,200
Get the fuck off him, now!
Just get off him!

712
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:01,280
It’s almost over.

713
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,290
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

714
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:32,150
All right, turn around.

715
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,070
I’ll be right back.

716
01:15:57,650 --> 01:16:00,450
It’s got blood on it.
You might want to wear it inside out.

717
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:01,650
Get your tapes.

718
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:21,970
Who's this?

719
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:27,810
It’s her kid.

720
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:30,730
What happened to her?

721
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:34,600
Who gives a fuck?

722
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,130
Hurry up. Get your stuff.

723
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,380
Hey, lady.

724
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:45,550
Mom?

725
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:52,310
What are you doing?

726
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:56,690
What are you doing?

727
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:08,160
We've got your kid.

728
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:18,120
Come down here.

729
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:22,960
Let's get this over with.

730
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,470
Get her, get her!

731
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:43,400
Shit!

732
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,120
What happened?

733
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,160
No! Let her out!

734
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,790
- Where's your gun?
- Open the door.

735
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,210
No!

736
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:07,260
- Where's your gun?
- I don't know.

737
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:08,930
Open up!

738
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:12,470
Open it.

739
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,230
Shut up! Listen to me.
She's got your gun.

740
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:22,860
She's got your gun!

741
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,980
Stop screaming. Stop it.

742
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:47,800
I know you've got the gun.

743
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:50,720
Put the gun down
and step away from the door.

744
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:57,600
You got to open the door.
My daughter is very sick.

745
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,770
She needs an injection.

746
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:02,150
Do you hear me?

747
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,810
Open the door so I can give her a shot.

748
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:08,440
Or I swear to God, I’ll kill you both.

749
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:11,320
If I open the door, you'll shoot us.

750
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:15,620
So give her the shot yourself.

751
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:18,790
Give her the shot!

752
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:32,510
Do you need this?

753
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,350
Can you do this yourself?

754
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:46,060
What happens if you don't get it?

755
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,860
Coma.

756
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:51,490
Die.

757
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,620
Fuck! Open it.

758
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:06,000
Put the gun on the floor.
And go all the way downstairs.

759
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:08,630
And I'll give her the shot, all right?

760
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:25,520
I told you to leave the gun!

761
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:32,150
Shit.

762
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:54,380
You fucking bitch!

763
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:59,930
If you pull any shit like that again,
I will fucking kill her.

764
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:01,720
Do you hear me?

765
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:06,140
If you step outside, I’ll kill her!

766
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:12,320
If I see a uniform inside this house,
I'll cut her fucking throat!

767
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,400
Do you understand?

768
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:21,410
Yes.

769
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,210
But please, just give her the shot.

770
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:30,170
Please.

771
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:33,630
Please.

772
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:38,510
Don't fucking do it.

773
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:41,510
While we're in here, she'll call the cops.

774
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,600
Are you going to open the safe?

775
01:22:49,190 --> 01:22:50,980
Don't you look at me.

776
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:06,200
All I know about this is what I see on TV.

777
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:08,250
You got to talk me through this.

778
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,630
This right here?

779
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:19,880
It’s this?

780
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:26,810
Yeah, okay.

781
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,860
Nice house you guys got.

782
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:39,110
Your mom's rich.

783
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:45,030
Dad's rich. Mom's just mad.

784
01:23:58,590 --> 01:23:59,880
Tap it.

785
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:19,070
I wish I could have put my kid in
a place like this.

786
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,990
It’s not that I didn't try.

787
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:25,830
Sometimes things, they don't work out
the way you want them to.

788
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:30,790
Done.

789
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:34,540
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

790
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:37,420
He had it all worked out.

791
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:40,300
Nobody was supposed to even be here.

792
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:44,380
Thanks...

793
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,720
...Burnham.

794
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:54,520
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

795
01:24:59,150 --> 01:25:00,690
She's going to be okay.

796
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:04,030
I gave her the shot. She's all right.

797
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,320
It'll be over soon.

798
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:26,590
Stephan.

799
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:31,770
Oh, my god.

800
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:36,560
Can you move?

801
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,980
Not much. I think my arm is broken.

802
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:02,630
Raise your arm.

803
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:05,010
Come on, raise your arm.

804
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:24,530
Try again.

805
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,240
Come on. Try again.

806
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:33,040
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.

807
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:37,870
They're going to kill us.

808
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,790
Just do everything they ask.
It'll be okay that way.

809
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:43,710
Stephan, they'll kill her.

810
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,440
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.

811
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:02,020
The police.

812
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,400
You called the police?

813
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,320
Of course, I called them.

814
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,450
You scared the shit out of me.

815
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:10,110
She killed the kid.

816
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:13,370
She just killed her own kid.

817
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:15,870
All right, take this.

818
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,540
Don't say a word.

819
01:27:23,710 --> 01:27:25,710
No, her husband must have called them.

820
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,590
Foreign son of a bitch. I told you!

821
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,550
Where is she?

822
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:36,810
There.

823
01:27:37,930 --> 01:27:39,600
What the fuck's she doing?

824
01:27:56,290 --> 01:27:57,950
She's going to handle it.

825
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,090
I’m just trying to unlock....

826
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:13,340
- Is everything okay?
- You all right, ma'am?

827
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:17,640
What are you.... What time is it?

828
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:21,020
It’s a little after 4:00 a.m.

829
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,940
We got a call, ma'am.

830
01:28:24,190 --> 01:28:25,610
Somebody called you?

831
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:28,650
Can we come in?

832
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:30,320
What do you want?

833
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:33,610
- We'd like to come in.
- No, you can't come in.

834
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,990
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?

835
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:37,950
I’m fine.

836
01:28:39,330 --> 01:28:41,210
Ma'am, you don't look so good.

837
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:53,090
Well, you don't look so hot yourself,
Officer Keeney.

838
01:28:55,390 --> 01:28:57,310
Come on, I’m freezing out here.

839
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:01,520
"There are three."

840
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,060
What?

841
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:07,270
Your husband said you called for help.

842
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:11,280
That you said, "There are three"
right before you got cut off.

843
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:16,530
Oh, that phone call.

844
01:29:16,910 --> 01:29:18,990
And your neighbors...

845
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:23,870
...called in about some loud shouts
or a loudspeaker of some kind?

846
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:28,670
That was the TV. It’s off now.

847
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:33,630
Can I just ask you one question?

848
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:37,050
What was the end of that sentence?

849
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:42,180
When you said, "There are three"...

850
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:44,850
...what was the rest?

851
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:50,570
Look....

852
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,360
My husband and I just split up...

853
01:29:57,030 --> 01:30:00,410
...and it's my first
night in a new house...

854
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:04,000
...and I admit I was a little drunk.

855
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:08,750
And the sentence,
if you insist on knowing...

856
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,460
...was going to be:

857
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,430
"There are three things that I’ll do for
you if you come jump into bed with me."

858
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:27,270
Thank God I came to my senses
before I said all that, and I hung up...

859
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:31,070
...so nobody would ever have to know
what I was thinking.

860
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:32,610
Unless, of course...

861
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:37,200
...two policemen came in the middle
of the night and interrogated me.

862
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,290
So, Rick, you want to go?

863
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:46,660
Or do you want her to tell you
which three things?

864
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:52,090
All right.

865
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:53,420
Ma'am...

866
01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:59,720
...if there's something you want
to say to us...

867
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:04,470
...but maybe you can't say it right now...

868
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:09,980
...you might want to make some kind
of a signal...

869
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:13,480
...by blinking your eyes a few times.

870
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:16,820
Something like that.

871
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:23,990
That's something you could do safely.

872
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:34,840
Man...

873
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:38,050
...you guys are good.

874
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,470
You mean, like if there was somebody
in the house or something?

875
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,980
They really train you guys.

876
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:54,400
No, I’m fine. I’m fine. Cross my heart.

877
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,200
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

878
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,370
'Night, ma'am.

879
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:24,100
This kid has seen my face.

880
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:26,930
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.

881
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:30,100
Yeah, it is. You're here with me.

882
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:32,350
You're on the hook, too.

883
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:36,480
Do one. Same price for the rest.

884
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:42,240
Stay the fuck away from me.

885
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,240
You know how this is going to end.

886
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:04,320
Goddamn!

887
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:42,280
What's up?

888
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:57,830
Why the hell didn't we do that?

889
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:07,130
What's she doing?
What the fuck does she think she's doing?

890
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:11,180
She's got your gun.
Who told you to bring a gun?

891
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:15,770
Just let me drill, man.

892
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:01,540
Empty?

893
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:04,080
Come on, man.

894
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:33,910
Bank bonds.

895
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:37,200
One second.

896
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:39,410
Two, three, four, five....

897
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:44,000
Why are we doing this?

898
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:47,670
Because it's going to come to that.

899
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,340
There are 22.

900
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:55,430
22 million dollars.

901
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:58,260
That lying little shit!

902
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:01,430
Let's get out of here.

903
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,020
Lift.

904
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:20,120
Leave that. Christ, I’ll buy you new tools.

905
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,330
You'll be okay.

906
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:05,100
It’s glass. I got you. Come on.

907
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:49,060
Hurry up.

908
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:51,940
Watch the glass.

909
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:56,540
Get down here.

910
01:41:58,670 --> 01:41:59,710
Wait.

911
01:42:00,510 --> 01:42:02,920
Wait. You don't want to do that.

912
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:04,590
Dad, don't shoot him!

913
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:08,810
Let my daughter go.

914
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:11,310
We're finished. Your daughter's fine.

915
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:16,560
We'll go out the back door.
You'll never see us again.

916
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:20,730
Let her go.

917
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:23,070
Okay.

918
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,780
It’s okay.

919
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:27,740
Let's go.

920
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:32,790
Let's go.

921
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:46,430
Just let her go. Let her go.

922
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:47,760
Let go of her!

923
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:49,640
Put that gun down.

924
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:51,680
- Sarah, come here.
- Put that gun down!

925
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:52,430
- Sarah, come here.
- Put that gun down!

926
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,350
- Do as I say.
- Don't be crazy, man.

927
01:42:55,730 --> 01:42:57,850
- Just let her go.
- Let her go!

928
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:16,250
Are you okay?

929
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:21,210
- Did they hurt you?
- No.

930
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:23,340
- Did they touch you?
- No.

931
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:33,180
Stephan, shoot him. Shoot him!

932
01:44:31,990 --> 01:44:34,080
Get off her!

933
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:16,410
You'll be okay now.

934
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:27,380
- Police!
- Don't move!

935
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:30,010
- Nobody move!
- Everybody on the ground!

936
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:34,760
Team two, upstairs. Team three, down.

937
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:36,050
Are you okay?

938
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,060
Are you all right?

939
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:44,900
Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker!

940
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:48,020
Don't move! I will kill you!

941
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:49,820
Move away from the wall!

942
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:52,900
Get off the fence! Move!

943
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:56,870
Put your hands in the air!

944
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:59,200
It'll be okay. It’s fine, Dad.

945
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:03,500
Is there anybody else in the house?

946
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:05,960
No.

947
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:11,090
Central, I need a bus at 38 West 94th.

948
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:20,680
It’s okay. I’m all right.

949
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:27,230
I want to see the palms of your hands!

950
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:30,730
Do you hear me? Open your hands!

951
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:46,330
Dad, it's okay. You're going to be fine.

952
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:48,580
Everything is going to be fine.

953
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:21,370
This sounds interesting.

954
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:23,910
"Two-bedroom with den or third bedroom...

955
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:27,500
"...new kitchen, original
bath, 70s East."

956
01:47:28,830 --> 01:47:30,920
I thought you liked the West Side.

957
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:34,630
"61st and Central Park West.

958
01:47:35,050 --> 01:47:38,800

- "...conserg..."
- Concierge.

960
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:46,140
- What's that?
- It’s French for "superintendent."

961
01:47:46,850 --> 01:47:48,900
What's W.E.A. mean?

962
01:47:49,150 --> 01:47:50,730
That's West End Avenue.

963
01:47:51,190 --> 01:47:52,730
"81st and West End Avenue.

964
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:56,360

"...cathedral windows..."

966
01:47:58,070 --> 01:47:59,740
Do we need all that space?

967
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:05,080
How about this?

968
01:48:05,330 --> 01:48:08,290
"West 83rd, two-bedroom,

969

970
01:48:13,971 --> 01:48:18,771
Yeah, that one. I like the sound
of that one.
